          I have a night-bewildered and dew-drenched couch <ref n="96.1">1</ref>, not visited by dreams, for fear, in place of sleep, stands at my side, so that I cannot firmly close my eyelids in slumber. And when I think to sing or whistle, preparing <ref n="96.2">2</ref> this the counter-charm of song against sleep, then do I mourn, sighing over the sad condition of this house, that is not, as of yore, most excellently administered. But now, may there be a happy release from my toils, as the fire of joyous tidings appears through the gloom! Oh hail! thou lamp of night, thou that displayest a light like as the day, and the marshalling of many dances in Argos, on account of this event <ref n="96.3">3</ref>. Ho! ho! I will give a signal distinctly to the wife of Agamemnon, that she, having arisen with all speed from her couch, may raise aloud a joyous shout in welcome to this beacon, if indeed the city of Ilion is taken, as the beacon-light stands forth <ref n="96.4">4</ref> announcing; and I myself will dance a prelude. For I will count the throws <ref n="96.6">6</ref> of my lord that have fallen well, mine own <ref n="96.5">5</ref>, since this kindling of the beacon-light has cast me thrice six.

          Greeks and Trojans alike, on account of the wife of many husbands, many limb-wearying struggles, when the knee is strained in the dust, and the spear-staff is shivered in the onset. But things are as they are; and will be brought to the issue doomed. Neither by weeping nor by pouring libations, nor by shedding tears, will he soothe away the intense wrath of fireless rites <ref n="98.1">1</ref>. But we, with our unhonoured aged frame, remain left behind the armament of that time, propping on staves our childlike strength. For both the marrow of youth shooting up within our breasts is weak as age, and Mars is not in place; and very advanced age likewise, after that its foliage is already withered, totters along its three-footed path, and nought superior to a child, flits like a day-dream. But thou, daughter of Tyndarus, Queen Clytemnestra, what means this? what new event? what is it that thou hast heard, and on the faith of what tidings art thou burning incense sent around <ref n="98.2">2</ref>? and the altars of all our city-guarding gods, of those above and those below, gods of heaven and gods of the forum, are blazing with offerings: and in different directions different flames are streaming upward, high as heaven, drugged with the mild unadulterated cordials of pure unguent, with the royal cake, brought from the inmost cells <ref n="98.3">3</ref>.

        <ref n="98.1">1</ref> The disputes respecting <quote xml:lang="grc">άπύρων ῐερω̃ν</quote> seem to be set at rest by Bamberger and Dindorf, who understand the sacrifice of Iphigenia to be meant. And if we consider the connexion of the sense, this is clearly required by the context from v. 40, as follows : The Atridæ hover over the heads of those who stole away Helen, like vultures mourning over their lost young. But as some god sends an Erinnys to aid the birds, so Jove sends the Atridæ against Paris, bringing a doubtful contest upon both Greeks and Trojans. But the end of all will be as fate decrees. Nor by any means will Agamemnon avert the unflinching wrath resulting from Iphigentia’s death." The chorus darkly hints at the consequences of Agamemnon's connexion with Menelaus, which are more fully explained hereafter.

And I invoke Ieïan Paean, that she may not work any long ship-detaining stress of weather, with winds adverse to the Greeks, urging on another sacrifice, an impious one, banquetless, the framer of strife among kindred, having no awe for a husband: for there abides a fearful, recurring <ref n="100.6">6</ref>, fraudful keeper of the house, a mindful child-avenging wrath <ref n="100.7">7</ref>."—Such destinies, drawn from birds seen upon the march, did Calchas along with great blessings chaunt forth to the royal households.

How can I be a deserter of the fleet, failing the confederacy? for it is meet that they <ref n="102.1">1</ref> with wrath full wrathfully should desire the sacrifice that shall lull the winds, and the blood of the maiden,—for it would be well.” But after that he had put on the yoke of necessity, breathing an impious, impure, unholy change of soul, from that time he changed his mind so as to cherish all-daring thoughts. For wretched frenzy, first source of woe, of foul counsel, hardens mortals. And thus he dared to become the sacrificer of his daughter, to promote a war undertaken for the avenging of a woman, and as a first-offering <ref n="102.2">2</ref> for the fleet: and the chieftains, eager for the fight, set at nought her supplications, and her cries to her father <ref n="102.3">3</ref>, and her maiden age.

        <p>Vulcan, sending forth a brilliant gleam from Ida; and beacon dispatched
          beacon of courier-fire <ref n="104.1">1</ref> hitherward. Ida, first, to the Hermaean promontory of
          Lemnos, and third in order Athos, mount of Jove, received the great torch from
          the isle, and passing o'er so as to ridge the sea, the might of the lamp as it
          joyously <ref n="104.2">2</ref> travelled, the pine-torch transmitting its gold-gleaming splendour, like
          a sun, to the watch-towers of Macistus. And [the watchman] omitted not his
          share of the messenger's duty, either by any delay, or by being carelessly
          overcome by sleep: but the light of the beacon coming from afar to the streams
          of the Euripus gives signal to the watchmen of Messapius; and they lighted a
          flame in turn, and sent the tidings onwards, having kindled with fire a pile of
          withered heath. And the lamp, in its strength not yet at all bedimmed,
          bounding over the plain of the Asopus, like the bright moon to the crag of
          Cithaeron, aroused another relay of the courier fire. And the watch refused
          not the light that was sent from afar, lighting a larger pile than those above
          mentioned; but it darted across the lake Gorgopis, and having reached mount
          Ægiplanctus, stirred it up, that the rule <ref n="104.3">3</ref> of fire might not be stint. And
          lighting it up in unscanting strength, they send on a mighty beard of flame, so
          that it passed glaring beyond the headland that looks down upon the Saronic
          frith, then it darted down until it reached the Arachnaean height, the

        <p>On this very day the Greeks are in possession of Troy: I think that a discordant clamour is loud in the city. If you pour into the same vessel both vinegar and oil, you will pronounce that they are foemen, and not friends. So you may hear the voices of the captured and the conquerors distinct [because of] a double result; for the one party having fallen about the corpses of men, both those of brothers, and children those of their aged parents, are bewailing, from a throat that is no longer free, the death of those that were dearest to them. But the other party, on the contrary is hungry, fatigue from roaming all the night after the battle arranging at meals of such things as the city furnishes, by no fixed law in the distribution, but as each hath drawn the lot of fortune <ref n="105.3">3</ref>. Already are they dwelling in the captured houses of the Trojans, freed from the frost beneath the sky, and from the dews, thus will they, poor wretches <ref n="105.4">4</ref>, sleep the whole night through without sentries. And if they reverence well the tutelary gods of the land which they have conquered, and the fanes of the god, assuredly, after having been captors, they shall not in their turn become captives. But let no lust first fall upon the army of making havoc of things forbidden, overcome by lucre. For, in order to a safe return, they must turn back through the other length of the race.

And not one of the gods lends an ear to his orisons, but sweeps away the unrighteous that hath concerned himself with these doings. Such too was Paris, when he came to the mansion of the Atreidae, and profaned the hospitable board by the abduction of a wife. And she, leaving citizens shield-bearers, and the discomfiture of spears, and naval armaments, and bearing to Ilion destruction as her dowry, passed swiftly through the gates, having dared undarable deeds and much did the bards <ref n="107.5">5</ref> of the house lament as they told this ditty. “Alas! alas! for the palace and the chiefs; alas! for the couch, and the footsteps of her who once loved her spouse <ref n="107.6">6</ref>.

          sigh as they praise one as skilled in fight and another as having fallen gloriously amid the carnage, in behalf of another's wife. These things does many a one in silence mutter. And jealous vexation creeps upon the chieftain Atrida <ref n="109.1">1</ref>. And others, fair of form, there around the walls, occupy tombs in the land of Ilion; and a foe-land shrouds them as its dwellers. Bitter is the rumour of the citizens accompanied by wrath, and it pays the debt as of a curse <ref n="109.2">2</ref> ratified by the people. And my anxious care is waiting to hear something wrapt in nightly gloom. For the gods are not regardless of those that occasion great slaughter: and the black Erinnyes in time, reduce to obscurity the man that is fortunate without righteousness, by a reverse of fortune; and the power of him that lives among the obscure is nought. Now for a man to have an exceedingly <ref n="109.3">3</ref> high reputation is a sad thing; for the thunderbolt from Jove is launched against his eyes <ref n="109.4">4</ref>; but I prefer happiness free from envy.

<p>Yea, for we have fared well. But this in a long time one might say that some things fall out well, but others on the contrary are open to complaint; for who, save the gods, is free from suffering throughout all time for evermore? For were I to tell our hardships, and our bad lodgments, our approaches [to the shore] infrequent and ill-bedded,—and in what part of the day were we not sighing, as not having met with our portion<ref n="112.2">2</ref>?—And then again the ills on shore were added, more loathly still: for our beds were hard by the walls of our foes : and from the sky and from the soil the meadow-dews drizzled on us, a deep rankling destruction to our garments making our hair shaggy. And were any one to describe the winter, death to birds, how intolerable the snow of Ida made it, or the sultriness, when ocean, having sunk upon his noon-tide couch unruffled by a breeze, slumbered<ref n="112.3">3</ref> without a ripple.—What need is there to grieve over this? the toil is past—past too with the dead is even the thought about ever hereafter rising. Why need one take exact account of those that fell, and why should the survivor feel sorrowed on account of adverse hap? I deem it good to bid a long farewell to misfortunes. With us, the remnant of the host of the Argives, the advantage preponderates, the suffering counterpoises not: wherefore it is fair for us, flying over sea and land, to make our boast to this light of the sun. <quote xml:lang="grc">"The armament of the Greeks, having at length captured Troy, have fixed these spoils as a glory to the ancient shrine<ref n="112.4">4</ref> of the gods throughout Greece."</quote> Those that hear such tidings must glorify our city and our commanders; and the favour of Jove, which hath brought this to pass, shall be honoured.

<p>Long since, in truth, I raised the jocund shout through delight, when the first mighty messenger of fire arrived, telling of the capture and overthrow of Ilion.—And some one chiding me said, “Dost thou, persuaded by beacon-lights, think that Troy has now been sacked? Verily it is like a woman to be much elated in heart." By words like these I was made to seem in error<ref n="113.1">1</ref>. Nevertheless I went on sacrificing; and, by a woman's edict, one and another, in different places throughout the city, raised aloud a shout of joy, pouring forth a hallowed song in the dwelling of the gods, while they lulled the fragrant incense-fed flame. And now what need is there for thee to say more to me? From the king himself I shall hear the whole tale. And I will haste to welcome back my revered lord on his return as well as I possibly can : for what day is more delightful for a woman to behold than this, to throw open the gates to a husband returning from warfare, when a god hath kept him safe? Bear thou this message to my husband, that he come with all speed, desired oy the city. And may he coming find a loyal consort in his house, just as he left her, a watch-dog of his home attached to him, a foe to the ill-disposed, and in -all other points alike, not having destroyed one single seal in the course of long time.

For fire and sea, of old most deadly foes, conspired together, and proved their faithful plight, destroying the hapless armament of the Greeks. And in the night, dire terrors of the waves were aroused.

<p>First of all it is right to salute Argos and the gods of the land that were joint authors of my return, and of the redress which I exacted from the city of Priam: for the gods, not hearing our plea from the tongue, flung without hesitation into the gory vase their ballots, the destruction of Ilion fatal to men, and o'er the opposite urn that was not filled by the hand Hope hovered. And now, still the city by its smoke shews evidently that it has been captured. The storms of <unclear>Atè</unclear> are alive; and the embers, dying along with the city, send forth rich exhalations of wealth. For these things it behoves us to repay ever mindful gratitude to the gods; since we both formed for ourselves<ref n="119.1">1</ref> a proud gin of conquest, and in a woman's cause the Argive monster bath levelled the city with the dust,—the young of the horse, the host equipped with shield, that leaped a furious bound, about the setting of the Pleiades<ref n="119.2">2</ref>, and the ravening lion springing over the towers bath lapped his fill of princely blood. To the gods have I lengthened out this my prelude, but in regard to thy feeling I remember to have heard it; and I say the same things, and thou hast me for thy fellow pleader. For to few men is this congenial, to honour without jealousy a friend in prosperity; for malignant venom having settled upon his heart doubles the pains of the man diseased: he is both weighed down by his own sufferings, and sighs as he looks upon the happiness of another.

The sense of <quote xml:lang="grc">ὑπερκόπους</quote> (which I read with Heath and Dindorf,) as applied to the Trojan horse, may be illustrated from Tryphiodorus, 321— <quote xml:lang="lat">"Illa subit, mediaeque minans illabitur urbi."</quote></note>

And had this my husband met with as many wounds as report conveyed to his home, he would have been pierced more full [of holes] than a net, so to say.

For Atreus, the ruler of this land, his father, being a rival about the power, that I may speak clearly, banished from his city and his house Thyestes my father, his own brother. And wretched Thyestes, having come again a suppliant at the hearth, found a secure lot, so that he should not dying stain his paternal soil with his blood. But Atreus, the godless father of this man, with more zeal than love, pretending cheerfully to hold a day of banqueting by way of welcome to my father, served him a banquet of his children's flesh. The parts about the feet indeed, and the comb-like tips of the fingers, seated apart, he broke from those above<ref n="142.1">1</ref>. And. having immediately in ignorance taken that part of the flesh which could not be distinguished, he eats a food, as thou seest, destructive to the race. And then, having discovered the unholy deed, he screamed, and falls back from the butchery vomiting: and on the descendants of Pelops he imprecates an intolerable doom, rightfully devoted to a curse the insult of the board<ref n="142.2">2</ref>,

so perish the whole race of Pleisthenes! In consequence of these things you may see this man fallen: and I am the righteous contriver of his slaughter, for he drives into exile me, the thirteenth child, along with my wretched sire. being a little one in swaddling-clothes. But Justice brought me back again when I had grown up. And I have reached this man though I was at a distance, having put together every contrivance for the sad conspiracy. Thus it is indeed glorious for me even to fall after I have seen him within the toils of Justice.</p>

<p>Ægisthus! I honour not insolence amidst guilt. And dost thou say, that thou didst wilfully slay this man, and that thou alone didst plot this piteous murder? I declare that thy head shall not escape, be sure of it, curses of stoning, hurled by the populace.</p>

<p>Dost thou say these things sitting at the lower oar, while those upon the middle bench<ref n="143.1">1</ref> of the vessel bear sway? Thou shalt know, old as thou art, how bitter it is for a man of thy years to be schooled, when discretion is prescribed him. But bondage and the pangs of starvation are the best physicians of the mind to school even old age. Having eyes seest thou not this? Kick not against the pricks, lest thou, stumbling, suffer.</p>

<p>These words too are the first parents of mourning. Thou hast a tongue quite opposite to that of Orpheus; for he. indeed, led all things along for joy of his voice. whereas thou having angered us by thy silly yelpings<ref n="143.3">3</ref>, shalt be dragged away: but when overpowered thou wilt show thyself more tame.</p>

<p>Aye! for to plot was plainly a woman's part; and I, an ancient foe, was a suspicious object.

<p>By no means, dearest of men, let us perpetrate any further ills. But to reap even these is in many respects a wretched harvest. And enough of misery assuredly is ours; let us not at all stain ourselves with blood. Repair, old men, forthwith to your appointed<ref n="144.2">2</ref> homes, before you suffer by your deeds: we must take these things and be contented with them since we did them; and if any one has a share of troubles, we at all events shall have enough of these, miserably smitten by the daemon in his fell wrath.
