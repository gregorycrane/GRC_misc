<sp><speaker start-line="1" end-line="11">POWER</speaker><p>We have arrived at the furthest confines of the Earth, the Scythian track, a desert wilderness; and now, Hephaestus, thou must attend to the charges which the Father has enjoined upon thee, to clamp this malefactor to the towering crags in firm shackles of adamantine bonds. For thine own rare jewel, the bright fire enabling every art, he stole and gave to mortal men; that is the sin for which he must give satisfaction to the Gods, that he may be<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="10"/> taught to accept the sovereignty of Zeus and cease from his man-befriending ways.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="12" end-line="35">HEPHAESTUS</speaker><p>Power and Force, the charge of Zeus to you is finished now, and there is nothing more before you; but I have not the heart to bind a brother-God by force upon a wintry bleak; however, come what may, strong need constrains me to take courage for it; for to make light of the Father's words is a grave thing. <stage>(To PROMETHEUS.)</stage> Thou high-contriving son of right-advisèd Themis, it is with a heart as loth as thine that I must pin thee with strong forged<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="20"/> fetters fast to this deserted steep,<ref n="3.1">1</ref> where thou shalt hear no voice nor see the form of man, but must be grilled by

the pure flame of the sun till thy complexion change; and thou shalt welcome it when starry-kirtled night shall hide the day, and when the sun shall dissipate again the morning frost; and ever the sore burden of the present ill shall harass thee; for thy deliverer is not yet born.</p>
<p>These are the fruits that thou hast reaped from thy man-befriending bent; thou didst not quail before the anger of thy fellow-Gods, but in transgression of right bestowedst<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="30"/> honours upon mortals. Wherefore thou shalt keep sentry at this dismal rock, in upright posture, sleepless, never bending knee; and many a groan and unavailing lamentation shalt thou utter; for the heart of Zeus is inexorable, and everyone is harsh whose power is new.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="36" end-line="38">POWER</speaker><p>Well now, why dallying and commiserating uselessly? Why dost thou not view with hatred one most hateful to the Gods, who betrayed thy precious thing and gave it to mankind?</p></sp>

<p>Behold with what foul tortures I am racked and must endure in them my myriad years! This is the humiliating bondage that the Captain of the Blessed hath devised against me.</p>
<p>Ah me, ah me, I groan for suffering present and for suffering to come, despairing of the quarter where the end of my afflictions is to rise.</p><milestone unit="marginlnum" n="100"/>
<p>And yet, what say I? I have clear fore-knowledge of all that is in store, and no suffering will come upon me with surprise; and the lot by Fate appointed one must bear as easily as may be, recognising that the strength of Necessity is not to be striven with. And yet to hold my peace, and not to hold my peace about my case is equally impossible: it was for making gifts to mortals that I have been fastened in these torments:-I hunted out the spring of Fire concealed within the filling of a reed, a stolen source which<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="110"/> hath been revealed to mortal men for their instructress in every art and their great providing means.

<sp><speaker start-line="209" end-line="212">CHORUS OF NYMPHS</speaker><p>Unfold now to us all the story and declare what charge it is that Zeus hath taken thee upon and tortures<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="210"/> thee with such disgrace and bitterness-unless there is any harm to thee in telling.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="213" end-line="257">PROMETHEUS</speaker><p>It is a painful thing to tell, and painful to withhold; miserable every way.—When first the Deities began their anger, and sedition was stirred up amongst them-one party seeking to cast Cronos from his throne, to make Zeus king, to wit, the other bent upon the contrary, that Zeus should never reign over the Gods,-I thereupon endeavoured<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="220"/> to persuade the Titans, children of Heaven and Earth, with the best advice, and was not able; subtle stratagems they quite despised, and thought with violent imaginations to gain the mastery without trouble and by force. But more than once my Mother, Themis or Gaea (Earth)—one form with many titles-had foretold to me the way in which the future was decreed to happen-how that it was not by strength or in the way of violence that the overcomers were to gain the mastery, but by guile. When I expounded this<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="230"/> to them in speech, they would not deign so much as even to look at it. So the best course that lay before me then appeared to be that I should take my Mother's aid and range myself, a welcome volunteer, upon the side of Zeus. And through my counselling it is that the black nether deep of Tartarus buries now the ancient Cronos with his allies together. These are the benefits which the sovereign of the Gods hath received from me and hath requited me with a reward so ill; for it is a vice inherent somehow in a<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="240"/> sovereignty, that there is no putting trust in friends.</p>
<p>But for your question, on what charge it is that he is torturing me, that I will make plain.</p>
<p>So soon as ever he was seated on his Father's throne, he
<pb n="10"/>
set about assigning to the Powers Divine their several privileges and mapped out their spheres of rule; but of wretched mortals he took no account whatever, but desired to annihilate the race entirely and create another new one. And to this there was no one that made any opposition<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="250"/> except me; I had the courage, I delivered men from being smashed to pieces and descending to the house of Death. And that is why I am now being bent with punishments like this, painful to suffer and piteous to behold: after preferring mortal men in pity I was not allowed to win the same myself, but have been straitened into shape thus mercilessly-a spectacle far from glorious to Zeus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="258" end-line="261">CHORUS OF NYMPHS</speaker><p>A heart of iron and made out of rock, Prometheus, is the being that feels not compassion in thy labours: I should have wished never to behold them, and beholding<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="260"/> them my heart is grieved.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker start-line="262" end-line="262">PROMETHEUS</speaker><p>I am indeed a sight that friends might pity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="263" end-line="263">CHORUS OF NYMPHS</speaker><p>Didst thou, perhaps, transgress a little beyond this?</p></sp>

Seest thou not that thou hast erred, and how thou erredst it is not pleasurable to me to say, and pain to thee.-But let us leave this matter; turn thou now to seeking some release from thine affliction.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="279" end-line="292">PROMETHEUS</speaker><p>It is an easy thing for one whose feet are safe out of the mire of harm to give advice and admonition to<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="280"/> another in distress; but I was aware beforehand of all this; of will, of will I erred, I will not deny it; succouring men, I got me sufferings myself. But still I never thought that I should be rewarded in this wise, to pine away upon rocks between earth and heaven, and get this desert and unneighboured peak. Now, pray you, mourn no longer for my present woes, but step upon the ground and let me tell you what is the oncoming future, that you may know the whole matter thoroughly. Consent, I pray, consent, show sympathy with<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="290"/> the one in trouble now; you know, 'tis common, and misfortune settles now upon one and now upon another.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker start-line="667" end-line="713">IO</speaker><p>I do not know how I can be disobedient to you; ye shall hear in plain terms everything that ye desire of me :— yet I am ashamed even in the telling of the heaven-inflicted<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="670"/> storm and ruin of my features-to tell whence it swooped upon unhappy me.</p>
<p>There were visions in the night continually haunting me, that kept visiting my bower with smooth words: 'O thou highly-blessèd Maiden, why art thou so long a virgin when thou mayest win the greatest marriage? The heart of Zeus hath been inflamed by an arrow of desire from thee, and he would fain have loving converse with thee: thou, therefore, my child, lift not thy foot to kick away the bed of Zeus, but go thou forth unto the deep meadow-land of Lerna to thy father's<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="680"/> flocks and oxen-stalls, to the end that the eye of Zeus may be eased of his desire.'</p>
<p>With dreams like this I was afflicted every night; until at last I brought myself to confess the haunting visions to my father: and he kept sending frequent ambassadors to the oracles of Pytho and Dodona to find out what act or word he must perform to do the pleasure of the Deities. And they kept coming back with vaguely-spoken oracles of dim significance and darkly worded. But at last there<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="690"/> came to Inachus a clear injunction, charging him directly in so many words to thrust me from my home and country to go wandering free at the extremities of the earth; and if he refused, a fiery thunderbolt should come from Zeus, which should destroy his whole house utterly.</p>
<p>Yielding obedience to this response of Loxias, he drove
<pb n="24"/>
me out and shut me from the house-as sorely against his will as mine; but the constraint of Zeus was upon him as a bridle, forcing him to do this thing.</p>
<p>And immediately my shape and senses were distorted,<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="700"/> and with horns, as ye behold, upon my head, fretted with a sharp-biting sting I rushed with frantic leaps to the sweet drinking water of Kerchneia, and the springs of Lerna; and an earth-born herdsman of unmitigated temper, Argos, followed, having vision with a host of eyes, upon my steps. But a sudden destruction came upon him unawares<ref n="24.1">1</ref> and took his life. And I, still frenzy-stung, am driven by the Scourge of God from land to land.</p>
<p>This is the story of these doings, and if thou canst tell<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="710"/> me what is the remainder of my toils, declare it, and do not out of pity flatter me with falsehood, for I think that made-up stories are the most shameful vice.</p></sp>
