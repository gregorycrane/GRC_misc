          <p>THE city of TROY was the metropolis of Troas, a country on the shores of the Hellespont, watered by the rivers Satnois and Rhodius on the south and north, and Scamander and Simois in the middle part.</p>
          <p>How long this city flourished is unknown, but it seems certain that it arrived at a high degree of wealth and power. Its first king is said to have been Teucer, and its last Priam, who, by his wife Hecuba, had nineteen children.</p>
          <p>The second son of Priam, Paris or Alexander, was, on account of a dream of his mother, denoting that he should set fire to Troy, brought up in obscurity as a shepherd. In this condition he is said to have decided the contest among the three goddesses for the prize of beauty. Afterwards, discovering his origin, and being acknowledged by his father, he made a voyage to Greece, where, being entertained by Menelaus, king of Sparta, he became enamoured of his queen, Helen, the most beautiful woman of her age, and fled with her to Troy, where she was received into the family of Priam as a daughter-in-law.</p>
          <p>But Menelaus was less disposed to be satisfied with his loss, than Paris and Priam with their gain, and prevailed on the most eminent leaders and princes of Greece to join with him in an expedition to Troy to recover his wife by force of arms. Of the troops collected for the expedition, which is said to have been

            two years in preparation, Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus, and king of Mycenæ and a large portion of the Peloponnesus, was chosen commander-in-chief. The other most remarkable leaders were Achilles, from Phthiotis in Thessaly; Ajax, son of Telamon, from Salamis; Ajax, son of Oileus, from Locri; Ulysses, from Ithaca; Diomed from Argos; and Nestor from Pylos. There were many others of inferior note.</p>
          <p>When the Grecian host, which filled twelve hundred such vessels as were then in use, arrived on the coast of Troas, they proceeded, it appears, to lay siege to the city of Troy. But the Trojans, headed by Hector, the son of Priam, with Æneas, a Trojan chief, Sarpedon king of Lycia, Pandarus of Zeleia, Pylæmenes of Paphlagonia, and other auxiliaries, made so resolute and vigorous a resistance, that the siege or blockade was protracted for ten years. It is supposed by Thucydides,<ref n="vi.1">1</ref> however, that the whole of this period was not occupied in attacks on the town, but that the Greeks, when the provisions which they brought with them were exhausted, applied themselves, for subsistence, to the cultivation of the neighbouring land, and to predatory excursions, leaving before the walls of Troy only just a sufficient number to keep up the form of a siege. Had their whole force, under the command of such able leaders, maintained continuous assaults on the city, it is not likely that the inhabitants, however resolute or skilful, would have succeeded in delaying the capture of it for so long a period.</p>
          <p>It was in the tenth year of the siege that discord arose between Agamemnon and Achilles, from the following cause. A pestilence spread through the Grecian army, and Calchas, the chief augur of the Greeks, being consulted respecting the origin of it, declared that it proceeded from Apollo, whose priest Chryses, having come to the camp to offer ransom for his daughter, (who had been taken prisoner by Achilles at the capture of the neighbouring city of Lyrnessus, and had been assigned, in the distribution of the spoil, to Agamemnon,) had been dismissed with a contumelious refusal by Agamemnon, and had in consequence called down the anger of Apollo on the Grecian army. Calchas foretold that the pestilence would not cease till Apollo should be appeased by the surrender of the captive to her father; and Aga<note type="footnote"> 1 B. i. c. 11</note>
             <pb n="vii"/>
memnon at length consented to part with her, but declared that, as he yielded her up for the public good, he must be indemnified by some equivalent; for that he, the commander-in-chief, must not be the only one of the leaders left without a due share of the spoil. Unless such equivalent were awarded him, he threatened that he would seize, by force, the portion of some one of the other chiefs. As no offer of indemnification was made, he carried his threat into execution, and seized upon Briseïs, another female captive, who had been assigned to Achilles. Achilles, deeply offended, retired in wrath to his ships, and refused to take any farther part in the siege. By his absence, the Greeks were so weakened and dispirited that Hector and his troops had the advantage over them in several encounters, and spread among them great slaughter and dismay.</p>
          <p>An embassy was sent to Achilles, offering him valuable presents, and the restoration of Briseïs; but he refused to lend his countrymen any assistance until Hector was actually setting fire to the ships, when he allowed his friend Patroclus to lead his troops to the rescue. Patroclus encountered Hector, by whom he was killed and despoiled of the armour of Achilles, which he had assumed on taking the field. Achilles was seized with grief and rage at the loss of his friend, and, as soon as new armour was made for him, returned to the field of battle and slew Hector, after whose death the Trojans were no longer in a condition to offer any effectual resistance to the besiegers. Troy was taken by the Greeks, according to the chronology which we adopt, in the year 1184 before the commencement of the Christian era.</p>
          <p>It is this tale that Homer has chosen to tell in that form of composition which we call an epic poem. He commences with the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles in the tenth year of the war, rushing, as Horace says, <quote xml:lang="lat">in medias res</quote>, and giving his reader to understand, in the course of his narration, what events had preceded the point of time from which he starts. At what period Homer lived, after the termination of the war which he relates, is utterly uncertain. Eratosthenes, the keeper of the Alexandrian library in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, and Crates, a grammarian contemporary with Aristarchus, place him in the first century after the capture of Troy; Aristotle and Aristarchus about a hundred and forty years after it; Philo<pb n="viii"/>chorus, the Athenian antiquary, forty years later; Apollodorus, the Athenian chronologist, a pupil of Aristarchus, two hundred and forty years after the Trojan war; the Arundelian marble two hundred and seventy-seven; Herodotus, four hundred years after it. Most modern men of learning, on taking everything into consideration, adopt a date somewhat earlier than that of Herodotus, and think that Homer flourished about three hundred years after the Trojan era, or about 850 B.C.</p>
          <p>But inquirers respecting Homer have been stopped at the threshold of their investigations by a party, of whom Frederic Augustus Wolf is the Hector, who have requested us to believe that no Homer, such as we have been accustomed to contemplate, ever lived at all; and that if there ever was a Homer, who had any concern in telling the history of the Trojan war, he was but a collector and arranger of other men's productions; for, as it is possible to conceive his name compounded of <quote xml:lang="grc">όμου̃</quote>, "together," and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἅρω</quote>, "to fit," it is very natural and proper, they say, to consider that he was but a "fitter together" of songs that other people had sung. But the representations of this party, though they had some effect a while ago, have ceased to be regarded with much attention by the learned and sensible part of mankind; who think it unlikely that such a production as the Iliad, of similar spirit, style, and consistence throughout, should have been the offspring of many minds, rather than of one. They consider that as, when they see a fine statue, of exquisite shape and symmetry, they are not apt to imagine that the different parts of it are the workmanship of different hands, but rather that one sculptor fashioned and finished the entire, so, when they read the Iliad or Odyssey, and find every part of it of a similar character, and each contributing to form a harmonious whole, they are not inclined to suppose its unity the result of the imaginations of several poets, but that of the single imagination of one. They reflect that, as the world has never produced many Shakspeares, or Miltons, or Spensers, at the same time, it is not probable that it produced many nearly contemporary Homers. They cannot deem it likely that Greece owes its two great epic poems to a number of verse-makers, whose very names are unrecorded; they cannot believe that the Homeric fire, glowing with a heat that no succeeding poet has equalled in its large inten<pb n="ix"/>sity, burned on many poetic altars, but rather that it was consecrated on one, and maintained by one inspired priest of Apollo and the Muses. They cannot credit that Thucydides, Herodotus, Aristotle, Longinus, Cicero, Ovid, Horace, and all the great minds of antiquity, were wrong in believing that Homer, whom the greatest poets worshipped as their master, whose distant footsteps they adored as unapproachable, and from whom they were humbly content to draw such inspiration as they were capable of receiving, was one individual, and that a "few modern German critics, of intellects utterly inferior to the great ancients whom we reverence, are right in admonishing us that we must distribute him into several.</p>
          <p>We shall therefore consider that the Homer of antiquity was a real personage; and we should be glad to learn some particulars of his life. But when we look about for them, we find none on which we can depend. We have a life of him attributed to Herodotus; but it has long ceased to be regarded as genuine; and the short account of him ascribed to Plutarch is held in no higher estimation. Both are supposed to be the compilations of mere grammarians. The Life imputed to Herodotus differs in chronology from Herodotus's history, placing Homer nearly two centuries and a half earlier, and might for that reason, if for no other, be regarded as spurious.</p>
          <p>The truth is, that, between the termination of the siege of Troy, and the date of the first Olympiad, B.C. 776, there occurs a dark interval, of apparently about four hundred years, of the events of which we have scarcely any knowledge. The return of the Heraclidæ, or Dorian invasion of the Peloponnesus, is said to have taken place eighty years after the fall of Troy, and the commencement of the emigration of the Ionians into Asia, about one hundred and forty-six after it; but of no other occurrences during that period is the chronology at all settled.</p>
          <p>But we find Homer often called Mæonides and Melesigenes and it is in the fictitious lives of him that we must search for the origin of those names. Whilst we are investigating these points, we may, perhaps, look a little farther, and see what account is to be found of Homer's life and fortunes. Of the place of his birth, none of the Greeks themselves pretended to any certain knowledge. Seven eminent cities claimed the honour of it,
             <pb n="x"/>
            according to the old line given in Aulus Gellius from the Greek, <quote xml:lang="lat">Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, Athenæ</quote>; but their claims found none to decide them. According to the life ascribed to Herodotus, however, it is said that he was born at Smyrna, and that his mother's name was Critheis, a native of Cumæ, daughter of Melanopus. Who was his father, the writer cannot tell us, for Homer was illegitimate. Critheis, being found with child by some person unknown, was sent away by Cleanax, under whose care she had been left by her father, to Smyrna, under the protection of a man named Ismenias. Soon after, she was delivered of Homer, on the bank of the Meles, a river near Smyrna, from whence he was called Melesigenes. Some said that Meles, the god of the river, was his father; others that his father's name was Mæon, and hence he is called Mæonides; though others, again, say that this name merely denotes him to have been a native of Mæonia, the old name of Lydia.</p>
          <p>When his mother was delivered of her son, she left Ismenias, and became acquainted with one Phemius, who had a school in Smyrna, and who made her an offer of marriage, engaging to adopt and educate her son. This offer she accepted, and she and her husband lived till Homer was grown up, when they both died about the same time, and Homer took charge of the school, which he conducted with so much success, that he gained the admiration not only of the inhabitants, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in corn, attracted to the city. Amongst these was Mentes, master of a vessel from Leucadia, a man of some knowledge and intelligence, who prevailed on Homer to relinquish his school, and travel with him, offering to pay his expenses and allow him a salary, and observing that it was proper that he should see with his own eyes, while he was still young, the countries and cities which he might hereafter describe. With Mentes he visited Spain and Italy, and touched, on the way back, at Ithaca, where, having previously suffered from a defluxion in his eyes, he became much worse, and was left by Mentes, who was called away to Leucadia, under medical care, with a friend of his named Mentor, from whom he experienced great hospitality and kindness, and learned the principal incidents in the life of Ulysses. When Mentes re<pb n="xi"/>turned, he accompanied him to Colophon, where, if not previously at Ithaca, he became entirely blind.</p>
          <p>Whether he was deserted by Mentes, or how he became separated from him, does not appear; but, finding himself in great poverty, he resolved on going back to Smyrna, where he might hope for some support from those who knew him, and for some opportunity to display or cultivate his poetical abilities. But, being disappointed in his expectations, he set out for Cumæ, and was entertained on his way by one Tychius, an armourer or leather-dresser, at Neon Teichos; and the inhabitants of the place, says the biographer, still point out the spot where Homer sat and recited his verses, and pay it great honour.</p>
          <p>He proceeded, however, after a time, to Cumæ, and being favourably received, and delighting the people with the recital of his poetry, he offered, if they would allow him a public maintenance, to do his utmost to make their city famous. His offer was taken into consideration in the public council, and the majority seemed favourable to the request; but one man observed, that if they resolved to maintain <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅμηροι</quote>, they would gather about them a great number of useless people, whence, says the biographer, the poet, who had been previously called Melesigenes, first received the name of Homer, for the people of Cumæ call blind men <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅμηροι</quote>. The remark had such effect, that the maintenance was refused, and the poet could not forbear uttering a wish that Cumæ might never find a poet to give it renown.</p>
          <p>From Cumæ he went to Phocæa, where one Thestorides, another master of a school, offered him a maintenance if he would communicate his verses to him. As Homer's necessities obliged him to comply with this proposal, Thestorides, as soon as he had made himself master of a sufficient number of the verses, went off to Chios, where he gained subsistence and credit by repeating them, until some people from Chios brought word to Homer of what he was doing; when Homer determined to pursue and expose him. Having made his way to Erythræ, he prevailed on some seamen to carry him over to the island, where the first person that he encountered was a shepherd named Glaucus, by whose dogs he had nearly been worried, but who entertained him kindly, and conducted him to his master, who, finding him a man of knowledge, induced him to stay in his house, and un<pb n="xii"/>dertake the education of his children. Thestorides was soon driven from the island, and Homer removed to the town of Chios, in which he raised a school of poetry, acquired a tolerable fortune, married, and had two daughters, one of whom died young, and the other married a Chian.</p>
          <p>He now proceeded with his poems, and inserted in them, says the biographer, the names of those to whom he had been most indebted; as Mentor, whom he makes the companion of Ulysses in the Odyssey; and Phœnix, whom he represents as an eminent minstrel to delight the suitors. He has also introduced the name of Mentes both in the Iliad and Odyssey, and that of Tychius in the Iliad as the maker of Ajax's shield.</p>
          <p>Resolving to visit Athens, also, he inserted something complimentary to the Athenians. On his way to Athens, the vessel in which he sailed made a circuit to Samos, where he remained the following winter; for, being recognized by a Samian who had known him in Chios, he was introduced to some of the richer inhabitants, and well entertained, reciting his poetry at their houses, and at the public festivals. In the spring he again set out for Athens, but the ship, which seems to have been doomed to deviations, found its way to Ios, one of the Cyclades, where he fell ill, and died.</p>
          <p>Such is an abstract of the earliest attempt that has reached us at a life of Homer. We find no ground for its statements, and should suppose that they may have been the mere fictions of a grammarian; yet there may have been traditions prevailing at the time when the writer lived, to afford them some support; and the writer himself, <quote xml:lang="lat">de mortuis nil nisi bonum</quote>, may have been an anxious inquirer, desirous to advance nothing for which he could not find a basis. He was evidently, however, a man of no vigour or comprehension of mind. He has inserted in his performance, as Homer's, verses which it is wonderful that he could have supposed the author of the Iliad to have written.</p>
          <p>That Homer was born at or near Smyrna seems to have been the general belief. Cicero, in his oration for Archias,<ref n="xii.2">2</ref> appears to consider the claim of Smyrna to be called his birth-place beyond those of Colophon, Chios, or Salamis. "The people of Smyrna," says Strabo,<ref n="xii.3">3</ref> "were firmly convinced that he was born<note type="footnote"> 2 c. 8.</note> <note type="footnote"> 3 B. xiv.</note>

in their city, and erected a temple to Homer, with a portico attached to it, which they called Homereion, a name which they also gave to one of their coins; and some have said that they burnt Zoilus alive for having tried to lower Homer in their estimation." The Chians, indeed, paid him similar honours, and spoke of a family among them called the Homeridæ, descendants of Homer; appealing also to the end of the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, which Thucydides<ref n="xiii.4">4</ref> cited as genuine, but which every scholar now regards as posterior to Homer's age. The following is a literal translation of the passage : "Farewell, all ye virgins; and remember me hereafter, whenever any one of men upon the earth, any hapless stranger, may come hither and inquire of you, 'Who is, in your opinion, the sweetest of the minstrels that dwell here, and with which of them are you most charmed?' then do you all answer, with the utmost cheerfulness, 'A blind man, and he dwells in rocky Chios.' " But this only intimates that Homer lived in Chios, not that he was born there.</p>
          <p>Some have said that he visited Egypt, and one Hephæstion, as recorded by Photius, says that he found at Memphis, in the Temple of Vulcan, two poems on the war of Troy, and the wanderings of Ulysses, which Phantasia, daughter of Nicarchus, had written and deposited there, and of which Homer contrived to get copies from one of the sacred scribes named Phanites, and composed from them his Iliad and Odyssey. But this Egyptian story, with Greek names, is doubtless a mere fabrication. Yet that Homer may have travelled into Egypt is not impossible; though the notion that he did so has perhaps arisen from the mention which he makes of Egypt and the Nile in the Odyssey.</p>
          <p>If we can imagine, says Pope,<ref n="xiii.5">5</ref> that there is any foundation of truth in what is offered to us as Homer's biography, we may gather from it "that he shewed a great thirst after knowledge, by undertaking such long and numerous travels; that he manifested an unexampled vigour of mind, by being able to write with more fire under the disadvantages of blindness, and the utmost poverty, than any poet after him in better circumstances; and that he had an unlimited sense of fame, the attendant of noble spirits, which prompted him to engage in new travels, both under these disadvantages, and the additional burden of old age."<note type="footnote"> 4 B. iii. c. 104.</note><note type="footnote"> 5 Essay on Homer, prefixed to the Iliad.</note>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            absolutely necessary for us to believe that the art of writing was wholly unknown among the Greeks three hundred years after the Trojan War. Herodotus, in whose time the art of writing was widely diffused, was born, it is supposed, about 484 B.C., or about four hundred years after Homer, if we suppose Homer to have flourished about the time which is given in the Arundelian marble, or three hundred years after the Trojan War, about which time Herodotus himself says that Homer flourished; and Herodotus had been preceded by Cadmus of Miletus, who is supposed to have flourished about B.C. 540, and who is universally called the first Greek writer of history, while Cadmus had perhaps been preceded, some few years, by Pherecydes of Scyros, who is said to have been the first that wrote Greek prose, and is generally allowed to have been the teacher of Pythagoras, who was born, according to Bentley and others, B.C. 608. If we suppose Pythagoras to have commenced his studies under Pherecydes at thirty years of age, he would have begun B.C. 578. We thus arrive at an earlier date than that at which Amasis, as Wolf says, first opened Egypt to Greek traders; (for Amasis came to the throne B.C. 569;) or within three hundred years of the time at which Homer is generally supposed to have lived by those who allow him to have lived at all; within two hundred, if we adopt the opinion of those who think that he lived five hundred years after the Trojan War.<ref n="xvi.14">14</ref> But we will adhere to the chronology of Herodotus, and suppose that we are arrived within three hundred years of Homer's time. Pherecydes and Cadmus of Miletus wrote at this period, and, as they wrote, must have had some material on which to write. If they had not papyrus, they might have had skins or parchment, for Herodotus<ref n="xvi.15">15</ref> expressly says that the lonians of Asia Minor used skins before they had the papyrus, and that after they adopted the papyrus, they continued to call the rolls or books formed of it skins, from the material which they had previously used when papyrus was scarce with them. Why, then, may they not have used skins for writing, as far back as the time when we suppose the Iliad and Odyssey to have been composed, and why may not those poems have been written upon skins? Wolf observes that it is uncertain when skins came<note type="footnote"> 14 See Archdeacon Williams's "Homerus," p. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> 15 Β. v c. 58.</note>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            into use; but we are quite as much at liberty to believe that they were in use three hundred years before the time of Pythagoras as he is to insinuate that they were not.</p>
            <p>At what time Cadmus and his colony brought letters from Phœnicia into Greece, (for that Phœnicians did bring them is attested by the voice of all antiquity,) it is impossible exactly to determine; but it is generally supposed to have been not less than three hundred years before the Trojan war, about the same time that Moses is considered to have written the Pentateuch. If such was the case, there was abundance of time for the knowledge of letters and writing to spread among the Greeks and their colonies before Homer wrote. The Asiatic Ionians, too, among whom we suppose Homer to have lived, preceded the other Greeks, as appears from Herodotus,<ref n="xvii.16">16</ref> in acquiring the art of writing.</p>
          <p>From the fact that the laws of Lycurgus were not written, we are not to infer that the art of writing was unknown in Greece in his time; for the reason why they were not written is said to have been that he wished them to be inscribed only in the hearts and minds of his countrymen. Writing, too, may have been little used at Sparta at that time, as indeed it always was, but it may have been well known in other parts of Greece. Lycurgus is also said, by Aristotle<ref n="xvii.17">17</ref> and Plutarch,<ref n="xvii.18">18</ref> and the account is not incredible, to have met during his travels in Asia Minor, with the poems of Homer in the custody of Creophylus, who was himself an epic poet, and, as he found that there was not only entertainment, but political and other instruction to be derived from them, is reported to have collected and transcribed them, with the intention, says Plutarch, of bringing them into Greece: for rumours of their excellence were then spreading abroad, and some few of the learned possessed portions of them. Whether he actually brought them into Greece, Plutarch does not say, but observes that he was the first who did much to make them known in that country. But Aristotle states positively that he brought them with him to Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>The tradition, which seems to have generally prevailed, that Phemius, the instructor of Homer, Thestorides with whom <note type="footnote"> 16 Β. v. c. 58.</note><note type="footnote">17 Apud Heraclid. Polit. frg. ii. ed. Schneidewin. Mure, Hist. of Lang. and Lit. of Greece, B. ii. c. 3, § 2.</note><note type="footnote">18 Life of Lycurgus, c. 4.</note>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            Homer was connected, and Homer himself, were schoolmasters, is a strong intimation that the art of writing was believed to have been known in his time; for, without it, what can be supposed to have been taught in a school? Homer, indeed, is said to have had a school after he was blind; but it is called a school of poetry, in which he may have given lectures, and others may have written from his dictation or under his direction.</p>
          <p>The arguments which Wolf extracts from the Iliad and Odyssey themselves, against the use of writing at the time that they were produced, can hardly be considered of any greater weight than those which he brings from external sources. If the chiefs that were going to fight with Hector did not write their names on their lots, it is surely no proof that they could not write, or, if they could not, that no Greek of that day could write. Charlemagne is said to have been unable to write his own name, but there were plenty of his contemporaries that could write theirs. Even if the Grecian leaders could write, it may have been an old custom, in casting lots, to make a private mark on each lot, and they may but have adhered to the custom. It is very unsatisfactory to argue that because men, whom we see only through the mist of antiquity, did not do a certain thing, they therefore could not do it.</p>
          <p>The passage relating to Bellerophon is of still less effect; for it is there said that Prœtus had "written many deadly things," (<quote xml:lang="grc">γράψας θυμοφθόρα πολλά</quote>,) as the words are generally interpreted; but the full signification of the phrase, as Mr. Barker, in his edition of Lempriere, has properly observed, seems to be, that Prœtus had written to Iobates many mind-corrupting things, many things intended to prejudice the mind of Iobates against Bellerophon, and induce him to put the youth to death. These things could hardly have been expressed by a few symbols, and therefore it can be no great presumption to suppose, with Bishop Thirlwall,<ref n="xviii.18">18</ref> that Homer meant that they were expressed in alphabetic writing.</p>
          <p>To lay any stress upon the passage from the Odyssey, in which an owner of a ship is said to have had no list of his cargo, would be utterly ridiculous. In the Œconomics of Xenophon, Socrates <note type="footnote"> 18 Hist. of Greece, vol. i. c. 6, sub fin.</note>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            speaks of a master of a large Phœnician ship, who knew where all the numerous articles in it were deposited, and could name the place of each when he was out of sight of them, yet is not said to have had any written list; and we might as well argue from this passage of Xenophon, that writing was unknown to the Phœnicians in the time of Socrates, as from the passage of the Odyssey that it was unknown to the Greeks.</p>
          <p>Even Bentley, who expressed an opinion similar to that of Wolf respecting the want of unity in the Iliad and Odyssey, did not deny that those poems were written by Homer. "Homer," he says, "wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself. * * * These loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about Pisistratus' time, about five hundred years later."<ref n="xix.19">19</ref> Whether this notion was conceived in Bentley's own mind, or suggested to him from some other source, may be doubtful; for Charles Perrault, in his parallel between the Ancients and Moderns, published in 1692, had thrown out conjectures of that nature. The theory was then advocated, in 1728, by Giambattista Vico, who asserted that the formation of the Iliad and Odyssey into regular poems was the work of Pisistratus and his coadjutors. Wood, in his Essay on Homer, published in 1770, started the question whether the poems of Homer were originally written or not; and Wolf, excited by the suggestion, advocated that pretentious theory, at variance with all antiquity, of which we have already endeavoured to estimate the value.</p>
          <p>Wolf, we have seen, places much dependance on a passage of Josephus, which affirms that the poems were not committed to writing till a later period. But "much reliance," as a writer in the Quarterly Review<ref n="xix.20">20</ref> has observed, "cannot fairly be placed on the authority of Josephus, writing in a controversial tract in which his avowed object is to exalt the antiquity of his own national records, and to depress those of other countries; nor are those who have most deeply studied the writings of Josephus, the most inclined to think favourably of his general accuracy. But besides this single passage of Josephus," adds the Reviewer, "which, after all, does not go much farther than the<note type="footnote"> 19 Letter to F. H. [Francis Hare], D.D., by Phileleutherus Lipsiensis.</note><note type="footnote"> 20 Vol. xliv. p. 128.</note>

            common story about Pisistratus, not even a grammarian [among the Greeks], although here and there one may appear to have made some advances towards the hypothesis of Wolf, explicitly denies that the poems were originally composed as a whole; the prevailing, indeed almost the universal opinion, asserted that the Pisistratid compilation was a reconstruction of poems, the parts of which time and accident had scattered asunder, not their first design and formation as consecutive and harmonious poetical histories."</p>
          <p>That poems of such a nature, exhibiting such a connexion and dependence of parts, and such a variety of characters, each appearing <quote xml:lang="lat">qualis ab incepto</quote>; keeping the principal character in view, as Clarke says, <quote xml:lang="lat">à capite ad calcem</quote>, from the exordium to the peroration; relating such a variety of incidents, of which no one clashes with another, but all tend to one certain catastrophe, and so many deaths of combatants of which no two are exactly similar; displaying, too, such a uniformity of style, adorned with such a variety of poetical similes, all of great excellence, such as Virgil and Milton were contented if they could but approach, were transmitted from the age of Homer to that of Pisistratus, in no other vehicle than that of the memory of rhapsodists, is a hypothesis which we know not how any man ordinarily qualified to judge of probabilities can bring himself to entertain. We are aware that there have been many instances of extraordinary memory, but we cannot convince ourselves that there ever existed a succession of men to communicate such poems, in the state in which we have them, from generation to generation through a long series of years. We have all heard of the man, mentioned in Mrs. Piozzi's Letters, who could repeat the Jerusalem Delivered from one end to another, forwards or backwards, without mistake; and the Quarterly Review<ref n="xx.21">21</ref> furnishes us a similar, or even more remarkable instance, of a man in Scotland who could repeat the whole Bible from beginning to end, and give any verse required from any part of it, the merest sand rope of proper names not excepted. But the appearances of such men in the world are "few and far between,"<note type="footnote"> 21 Vol. xliv. p. 144.</note>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            and we cannot imagine that a succession of men ever existed of such powers of memory as to hand down the poems of Homer century after century, without some writing to which they could refer for aid. It is easier to suppose, as Bishop Thirlwall says, that the poems were written at first, than that they were written at a subsequent period.</p>
          <p>What we conclude from all we have considered, then, is, that Homer was not a creature of the imagination, but, as all antiquity believed, a real person, who lived about three hundred years after the Trojan war; that of the particulars of his life nothing is certainly known, but that it is probable there was a basis for the traditions that he was poor, blind for a time, and a wanderer, and that, if he was not born at Smyrna, he at least visited it, as well as Chios and Colophon; that he composed the Iliad and Odyssey, perhaps in detached parts, but doubtless connected them at last into consistent wholes; that the art of writing was known, if not in Greece, at least in Asia Minor, in his time, though it may have been confined to very few, and that those great poems were committed to writing, either by himself or under his superintendence; that the rhapsodists sang them in detached portions, in earlier times as in later, even in the days of Socrates, long after copies of them had been multiplied; that their excellence became gradually known, and that Lycurgus, whom Cicero<ref n="xxi.1">1</ref> makes even contemporary with Homer, may have brought them to Sparta, or, if not, may at least have aided in disseminating a knowledge of them through Greece; and that Pisistratus, probably assisted by some of the great geniuses of his day, may have striven, as Cicero tells us,<ref n="xxi.2">2</ref> to repair the damage that time had produced in them, and restore them to the state in which he conceived the illustrious author to have left them.</p>
          <p>Let it be observed that no great poetical genius, no man fit to have a seat near the throne of Homer, no Byron, or Goethe, or Moore, has been in danger of being misled by the theory, as it is called, of Wolf; a theory started and upheld at first mostly by men of the standing of Kuster, Burman, and Wasse, who, to borrow Pope's illustration, will never see how the parts of a great poem consist with one another and with the whole, till a<note type="footnote"> 1 Tusc. Quæst. v. 3.</note><note type="footnote"> 2 De Orat. iii. 34.</note>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            flea shall contemplate the structure of a human body, or, in the words of the same author, before whose uncreating word light dies. If Wolf's hypothesis has since been patronized by men of a somewhat higher character, it has been patronized by them, as the general sense of mankind is beginning to declare, only to their discredit. We shall still have our Homer entire, and any attempts to distribute him into parts, or make him evaporate into a myth, will, we may fairly prophesy, prove as futile as the late fanciful project of dividing the plays of Shakspeare between Raleigh and Bacon.</p>
          <p>Some remarks on the Odyssey in particular will be offered in the next volume.</p>
          <p>Against the version of Pope, which is here once more reprinted, much criticism, and animadversions of various sorts, have at times been directed. But all the objections that have been made to it are little more than a repetition of Bentley's remark that "it is not Homer."</p>
          <p>That it is not a literal translation of Homer, rendering every phrase in words exactly correspondent, is well known; but it is what the English world has been well content to accept instead of a literal translation.</p>
          <p>Pope, as is now well understood, was not a great Greek scholar, notwithstanding Lord Bathurst's statement to Dr. Blair, that, when he was executing part of the Iliad at that nobleman's house, he would repeat at breakfast the Greek lines which he had previously been translating, accompanied with his own version. Much stress has been laid upon this anecdote by those who wish to make the most of Pope's knowledge of Greek; but it will not prove it to have been very deep; for a man may repeat a few Greek lines with but a very imperfect conception of their meaning.</p>
          <p>But if Pope had not the Greek of a Bentley or a Porson, he had that which was of far more importance to a translator of Homer than a greater knowledge of Greek would have been. He had great acuteness and penetration, and was able to see far better into Homer's meaning than many who had far more knowledge of Homer's language; and when he had made himself master of
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            Homer's matter, he could express it in his own language with a fire and energy that a mere scholar would attempt in vain : <quote xml:lang="lat">Sudet multum frustraque laboret, Ausus idem.</quote></p>
          <p>He doubtless did not always compass the sense with equal success; he sometimes perverts and sometimes exaggerates; but his misrepresentations are chiefly in minor matters; Homer's great thoughts and noble passages are in general rendered with all the fidelity and exactness that a great poet would desire.</p>
          <p>In how much esteem Pope's version, with all its faults, is held by the English public, is shown by the fortune of all subsequent attempts that have been made to represent Homer in English with greater accuracy. Of these, the chief are Cowper's and Sotheby's. Cowper, though he had no superabundance of Greek, had enough to render Homer faithfully; but he is guilty, alas! of that from which every translator of the mighty Grecian should be free; his blank verse is tame and unenergetic; he has occasional warmth, but no ardour; he has not even cherished the fire with which his master supplied him. Sotheby has succeeded better, though he ventured on the hazardous experiment of encountering Pope in the heroic couplet; but he has only encountered, he has not rivalled; his verses are smooth, and show a scholar's fidelity to the sense, but want "The high majestic march and energy divine."</p>
          <p>His version is to Pope's what Pitt's Virgil is to Dryden's; more true to the original, but less pleasing to the reader.</p>
          <p>After the fate of these efforts, it is futile to decry Pope's translation as mere "splendid varnish." The public allow that there is varnish, but have found out that there is excellent stuff, whether Homer's or Pope's, below the varnish. They still regard Pope as the English Homer; and all rival performances, except Sotheby's and Cowper's, have found favour neither with the learned nor the unlearned, neither with those who pretend to judge <quote xml:lang="lat">quid distent æra lupinis</quote>, nor with those who "give up the reins of their imagination into their author's hands, and are pleased they know not why, and care not wherefore."</p>

The few notes are intended chiefly for the elucidation of passages that might seem obscure to the mere English reader; they are mostly from Pope; some few from Cowper; both of whom borrowed liberally from Eustathius and the Greek scholiasts.

          <p>HOMER is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellencies; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes Art with all her materials, and without it, Judgment itself can at best but steal wisely: for Art is only like a prudent steward, that lives on managing the riches of Nature. Whatever praises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them but is owing to the invention: as in the most regular gardens, however Art may carry the greatest appearance, there is not a plant or flower but is the gift of Nature. The first can only reduce the beauties of the latter into a more obvious figure, which the common eye may better take in, and is therefore more entertained with them. And perhaps the reason why most critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through an uniform and bounded walk of art, than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.</p>
          <p>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery, which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant, it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because they are over-run and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.</p>
          <p>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture, which is so forcible in<note type="footnote"> c</note>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            Homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him. What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; everything moves, everything lives, and is put in action. If a council be called, or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes, <quote xml:lang="grc">Οἱ δ᾽ ἀρ᾽ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πᾶσα νέμοιτο.</quote></p>
          <p>They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it. It is, however, remarkable that his fancy, which is every where vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour; it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but this poetical fire, this <quote xml:lang="lat">vivida vis animi</quote>, in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but every where equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius, it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: in Milton, it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in Shakspeare, it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns every where clearly, and every where irresistibly.</p>
          <p>I shall here endeavour to shew, how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet, through all the main constituent parts of his work, as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors.</p>
          <p>This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters; and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions; but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls the soul of poetry, was first breathed into it by
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            Homer. I shall begin with considering him in this part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.</p>
          <p>Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such as, though they did, become fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an Epic poem, the return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy, or the like. That of the Iliad, is the anger of Achilles, the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other Epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroys the unity of his action for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil, and Scipio of Silius, are sent after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just as long, on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon and the taking of Troy was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</p>
          <p>To proceed to the allegorical fable. If we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            philosophy, which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us? How fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms and persons; and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer; and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged the circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention, as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem.</p>
          <p>The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity. For we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods, constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the undoubted inventor of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set: every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry.</p>
          <p>We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and untractable; that of Diomed forward, yet listening to advice and subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy, and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier, in Sarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the under-parts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example, the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural, open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished, and where they are marked most evidently, affect us not in proportion to those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar, but as it is in a superior degree; and we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this track of reflection, if he will pursue it through the Epic and Tragic writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of Homer was to that of all others.</p>
          <p>The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. Every thing in it has manners (as Aristotle expresses it); that is, every thing is acted or spoken. It is hardly credible in a work of such length, how small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil, the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative; and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of the author himself when we read Virgil than when we are engaged in Homer: all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action described: Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.</p>
          <pb n="xxx"/>
          <p>If in the next place we take a view of the sentiments, the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture: Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.</p>
          <p>If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together, by the extent and fecundity of his imagination; to which all things, in their various views, presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to perfection, at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side-views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner; and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near the number of images and descriptions in any Epic poet; though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him: and it is evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master.</p>
          <p>If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction, the first who taught that language of the gods to men. His expression is like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out living words; there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever. An arrow is impatient to be on the wing, a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like. Yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it.
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it; and in the same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter; as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous: like glass in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more intense.</p>
          <p>To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention; since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they are joined. We see the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet <quote xml:lang="grc">Κορυθαίολος</quote>, the landscape of mount Neritus in that of <quote xml:lang="grc">Εἰνοσίφυλλος</quote>, and so of others; which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a single line), without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets is a short description.</p>
          <p>Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that. He was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, but searched through its differing dialects with this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers: he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables; so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent; and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a farther representation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony, which makes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear, in the world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses, even without understanding them
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            (with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound than in any other language or poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just to ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed, the Greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language. Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of; and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words, and others will be taken notice of in the course of my notes. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated; and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.</p>

            <p>Thus, on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other; his manners more lively and strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil with regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty, and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that we are to
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            think Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work. Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity, Virgil leads us with an attractive majesty: Homer scatters with a generous profusion, Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence: Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate: Homer, boundless and irresistible as Achilles, bears all before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the action, disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens; Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.</p>
          <p>But, after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues; they naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.</p>
          <p>Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances. Thus Homer has his speaking horses, and Virgil his myrtles distilling blood; where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.</p>
          <p>It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability
             <pb n="xxxiv"/>
            to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind.</p>
          <p>If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods, and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,<note type="footnote">* Preface to her Homer.</note> "that those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours." Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned through the world; when no mercy was shewn but for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages; in beholding monarchs without their guards, princes tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will become a satisfaction.</p>
          <p>This consideration may farther serve to answer for the constant
             <pb n="xxxv"/>
            use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes, such as the far-darting Phœbus, the blue-eyed Pallas, the swift-footed Achilles, &amp;c., which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated. Those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them, and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks, having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander, the son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &amp;c. Homer therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &amp;c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition, I shall add a farther conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one, of heroes distinct from other men, a divine race, who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.<note type="footnote">* Hesiod. lib. i. ver. 155, &amp;c.</note> Now among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their families, actions, or qualities.</p>
          <p>What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as heard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise him in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser
             <pb n="xxxvi"/>
            man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other: or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character; it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select those particular passages of Homer, which are not so laboured as some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original; and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of Perault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &amp;c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author, whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Motte; who yet confesses upon the whole, that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in this sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.</p>
          <p>In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses, which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other arts in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation. He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted every thing. A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the finest fruit; nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join to make it valuable; and they who find the justest
             <pb n="xxxvii"/>
            faults, have only said, that a few branches (which run luxuriant through a richness of nature) might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.</p>
          <p>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and simile; whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his proper province; since these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</p>
          <p>It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect: which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary for transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity. Methinks I see these
             <pb n="xxxviii"/>
            different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle); others slowly and servilely creeping in his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity: no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well as a bald and sordid one, which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.</p>
          <p>This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired writings, that the divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of the world; and as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator on the one hand to give into several of those general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.</p>
          <p>For a farther preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have something venerable, and, as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast. But certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, such as platoon, campaign, junto, or the like (into which some of his translators have fallen), cannot be allowable; those only excepted, without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language.</p>
          <pb n="xxxix"/>
          <p>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction which are a sort of marks, or moles, by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight: those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who are, seem pleased with them as beauties. I speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition: as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of them; such as the cloud-compelling Jove, &amp;c. As for the rest, whenever they can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compound one, the course to be taken is obvious.</p>
          <p>Some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet <quote xml:lang="grc">εἰνοσίφυλλος</quote> to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leaf-shaking, but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis: The lofty mountain shakes his waving woods. Others that admit of differing significations, may receive an advantage by a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, <quote xml:lang="grc">ἑκηβόλος</quote>, or far-shooting, is capable of two explications; one literal in respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun: therefore in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former interpretation, and where the effects of the sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already shewn) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once shew his fancy and his judgment.</p>
          <p>As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts; of whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or hemistich. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial
             <pb n="xl"/>
            of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression, but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorised to omit any; if they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.</p>
          <p>It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said) is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I know only of Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in Latin. I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it, but those who have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.</p>
          <p>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four or six lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author, insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &amp;c. In a word, the nature of the man may account for his whole performance; for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry. His own boast of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen weeks, shews with what negligence his version was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which is something like what one might
             <pb n="xli"/>
            imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived to years of discretion.</p>
            <p>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for particulars and circumstances, he continually lops them, and often omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and sentences, and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.</p>
          <p>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil, his version of whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers; though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it.</p>
          <p>That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity: not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps, too, he ought to conclude the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What I would farther recommend to him, is to study his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may<note type="footnote"> d</note>
             <pb n="xlii"/>
            make in the estimation of the world; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author, and Bossu's admirable treatise of the Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning. For to satisfy such as want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</p>
          <p>What I have done is submitted to the public, from whose opinions I am prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer.<note type="footnote">* The words "as I wish, for the sake of the world, he had prevented me in the rest," were inserted here in the first edition, but subsequently elided, apparently from a conviction that no reader would think them sincere.</note> I must add the names of Mr. Rowe and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a farther opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good-nature (to give it a great panegyric) is no less extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me, while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning, as my chief encouragers? Among these it is a par<pb n="xliii"/>ticular pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet: That his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent Essay) so complete a praise:

            That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me, of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example: That such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author<note type="footnote">* George Granville, Lord Lansdowne.</note> of the tragedy of Heroic Love has continued his partiality to me, from my writing Pastorals, to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of this translation.</p>
          <p>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the Earl of Carnarvon, but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair. The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends, to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.</p>
          <p>In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens, that has been shown me by its learned rival, the university of Oxford. And I can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is the more to be acknowledged, as it is shewn to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of<note type="footnote"> d 2</note>
             <pb n="xliv"/>
            particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass* some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.<note type="footnote">* This part of the preface, therefore, must have been written before the completion of his translation.

<title type="sub">THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</title>
</ab>
<p>In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns, and taking from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseïs and Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses, the father of Chryseïs, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god, who inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to de­ clare the cause of it, who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseïs. The king being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on Briseïs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sen­ sible of the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter granting her suit, incenses Juno, between whom the debate runs high, till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.</p>
<p>The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book; nine during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the Princes, and twelve for Jupiter's stay with the Ethiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.</p>

Jupiter, learning the particulars of this cabal from Thetis, suspended Juno by the wrists, commanded Neptune and Apollo to work for Laomedon, and, in recompense of such signal service rendered him by Thetis, conferred on her son Achilles the honour of complete vengeance for the injury done him by Agamemnon.

<ab>
<title type="sub">THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.</title>
</ab>
<p>Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle; in order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague, as well as by length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in coun­ cil, that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unani­ mously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them into their several nations, be­ fore they proceeded to battle. This gives occasion to the poet to enu­ merate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, in a large catalogue.</p>
<p>The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene lies in the Grecian camp and upon the sea-shore; toward the end it removes to Troy.</p>
<lg>
<l n="2.1">Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,</l>
<l n="2.2">Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie,</l>
<l n="2.3">Th' immortal slumber'd on their thrones above;</l>
<l n="2.4">All but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.</l>
<l n="2.5">To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,</l>
<l n="2.6">And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:</l>
<pb n="22"/>
<l n="2.7">Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,</l>
<l n="2.8">And thus commands the vision of the night:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.9">'Fly hence, deluding Dream! and, light as air,</l>
<l n="2.10">'To Agamemnon's ample tent repair.</l>
<l n="2.11">'Bid him in arms draw forth th' embattled train,</l>
<l n="2.12">'Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.</l>
<l n="2.13">'Declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy</l>
<l n="2.14">'The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.<ref n="22.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="2.15">'For now no more the gods with fate contend,</l>
<l n="2.16">'At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.</l>
<l n="2.17">'Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,</l>
<l n="2.18">'And nodding Ilion waits th' impending fall.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.19">Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,</l>
<l n="2.20">Descends, and hovers o'er Atrides' head;</l>
<l n="2.21">Cloth'd in the figure of the Pylian sage,</l>
<l n="2.22">Renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age;</l>
<l n="2.23">Around his temples spreads his golden wing,</l>
<l n="2.24">And thus the flatt'ring dream deceives the king:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.25">'Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,</l>
<l n="2.26">'Oh Atreus' son! canst thou indulge thy rest?</l>
<l n="2.27">'Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,</l>
<l n="2.28">'Directs in council, and in war presides,</l>
<l n="2.29">'To whom its safety a whole people owes,</l>
<l n="2.30">'To waste long nights in indolent repose.</l>
<l n="2.31">'Monarch awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,</l>
<l n="2.32">'Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.</l>
<l n="2.33">'In just array draw forth th' embattled train,</l>
<l n="2.34">'Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;</l>
<l n="2.35">'E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy</l>
<l n="2.36">'The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.</l>
<l n="2.37">'For now no more the gods with fate contend,</l>
<l n="2.38">'At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.</l>
</lg>
<note n="22.1">1 It appears from Aristotle, Poet. c. 26, that Homer was accused of impiety for making Jupiter the author of a lie in this passage. * * * But Macrobius, <quote xml:lang="lat">de Somn. Scip.</quote> I. 7, takes off this imputation entirely, and will not allow there was any lie in the case. "Agamemnon," says he, "was ordered by the dream to lead out all the forces of the Greeks; now Achilles and his forces not being summoned to the assembly with the rest, that neglect absolved Jupiter from his promise." * * * Mr. Dacier takes notice of a passage in the Scripture exactly parallel to this, where God is represented making use of the malignity of his creatures to accomplish his judgments. It is in 2 Chron. xviii. 19-21. "And the Lord said, who will persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also. Go forth and do so." Pope.</note>

<l n="2.47">Vain as he was, and to the future blind;</l>
<l n="2.48">Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design'd;</l>
<l n="2.49">What mighty toils to either host remain,</l>
<l n="2.50">What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!</l>
<l n="2.51">Eager he rises, and in fancy hears</l>
<l n="2.52">The voice celestial murmuring in his ears.</l>
<l n="2.53">First on his limbs a slender vest he drew,</l>
<l n="2.54">Around him next the regal mantle threw,</l>
<l n="2.55">Th' embroider'd sandals on his feet were tied;</l>

<l n="2.59">Now rosy morn ascends the court of Jove,</l>

<l n="2.61">The king dispatch'd his heralds with commands</l>

<l n="2.63">The gath'ring hosts the monarch's word obey;</l>
<l n="2.64">While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.</l>
<l n="2.65">In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;</l>
<l n="2.66">There calls a senate of the peers around:</l>

<l n="2.68">The counsels labouring in his artful breast:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.69">'Friends and confed'rates! with attentive ear</l>
<l n="2.70">'Receive my words, and credit what you hear.</l>
<l n="2.71">'Late as I slumber'd in the shades of night,</l>
<l n="2.72">'A dream divine appear'd before my sight;</l>
<l n="2.73">'Whose visionary form like Nestor came,</l>
<l n="2.74">'The same in habit, and in mien the same.</l>
<l n="2.75">'The heavenly phantom hover'd o'er my head,</l>
<l n="2.76">'And, Dost thou sleep, O Atreus' son? (he said)</l>
<l n="2.77">'Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,</l>
<l n="2.78">'Directs in council, and in war presides,</l>
<l n="2.79">'To whom its safety a whole people owes,</l>
<l n="2.80">'To waste long nights in indolent repose.</l>
<l n="2.81">'Monarch awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,</l>
<l n="2.82">'Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care;</l>
<l n="2.83">'In just array draw forth th' embattled train,</l>
<l n="2.84">'And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="24"/>
<lg>
<l n="2.85">'E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy</l>
<l n="2.86">'The lofty towers of wide extended Troy.</l>
<l n="2.87">'For now no more the gods with fate contend,</l>
<l n="2.88">'At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.</l>
<l n="2.89">'Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,</l>
<l n="2.90">'And nodding Ilion waits th' impending fall.</l>
<l n="2.91">'This hear observant, and the gods obey!</l>
<l n="2.92">'The vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.</l>
<l n="2.93">'Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,</l>
<l n="2.94">'Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.</l>
<l n="2.95">'But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,</l>
<l n="2.96">'Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.</l>
<l n="2.97">'To move the troops to measure back the main,</l>
<l n="2.98">'Be mine; and yours the province to detain.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.99">He spoke, and sat; when Nestor rising said,</l>
<l n="2.100">(Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd:)</l>
<l n="2.101">'Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,</l>
<l n="2.102">'Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;</l>
<l n="2.103">'Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host,</l>
<l n="2.104">'Forbid it heaven! this warning should be lost!</l>
<l n="2.105">'Then let us haste, obey the god's alarms,</l>
<l n="2.106">'And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.107">Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay</l>
<l n="2.108">Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:</l>
<l n="2.109">The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,</l>
<l n="2.110">Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.</l>
<l n="2.111">As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees</l>
<l n="2.112">Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,</l>
<l n="2.113">Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms</l>
<l n="2.114">With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;</l>
<l n="2.115">Dusky they spread, a close-embodied crowd,</l>
<l n="2.116">And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.</l>
<l n="2.117">So, from the tents and ships, a lengthening train</l>
<l n="2.118">Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:</l>
<l n="2.119">Along the region runs a deafening sound;</l>
<l n="2.120">Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.</l>
<l n="2.121">Fame flies before, the messenger of Jove,</l>
<l n="2.122">And shining soars, and claps her wings above.</l>
<l n="2.123">Nine sacred heralds now proclaiming loud</l>
<l n="2.124">The monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.</l>
<l n="2.125">Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,</l>
<l n="2.126">And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,</l>
<l n="2.127">The king of kings his awful figure rais'd;</l>
<l n="2.128">High in his hand the golden sceptre blaz'd:</l>
<l n="2.129">The golden sceptre, of celestial frame,</l>
<l n="2.130">By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came:</l>
</lg>
<pb n="25"/>

<lg>
<l n="2.131">To Pelops he th' immortal gift resign'd;</l>
<l n="2.132">The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,</l>
<l n="2.133">In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,</l>
<l n="2.134">To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;</l>
<l n="2.135">And now, the mark of Agamemnon's reign,</l>
<l n="2.136">Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="2.137">On this bright sceptre now the king reclin'd,</l>
<l n="2.138">And artful thus pronounced the speech design'd;</l>
<l n="2.139">'Ye sons of Mars! partake your leader's care,</l>
<l n="2.140">'Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!</l>
<l n="2.141">'Of partial Jove with justice I complain,</l>
<l n="2.142">'And heavenly oracles believ'd in vain.</l>

<l n="2.147">'So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!</l>
<l n="2.148">'At whose command whole empires rise or fall:</l>
<l n="2.149">'He shakes the feeble props of human trust,</l>
<l n="2.150">'And towns and armies humbles to the dust.</l>
<l n="2.151">'What shame to Greece a fruitless war to wage,</l>
<l n="2.152">'Oh lasting shame in every future age!</l>
<l n="2.153">'Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,</l>
<l n="2.154">'Repuls'd and baffled by a feeble foe.</l>
<l n="2.155">'So small their number, that, if wars were ceas'd,</l>
<l n="2.156">'And Greece triumphant held a general feast,</l>
<l n="2.157">'All rank'd by tens; whole decades, when they dine,</l>

<l n="2.159">'But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,</l>
<l n="2.160">'And Troy prevails by armies not her own.</l>
<l n="2.161">'Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,</l>
<l n="2.162">'Since first the labours of this war begun;</l>
<l n="2.163">'Our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,</l>

<note n="25.3">3 I must take notice that this speech of Agamemnon is again put into his mouth in the ninth Iliad, and, according to Dionysius, for the same purpose, to detain the army at a siege after a defeat; though it seems unartful to put the same trick twice upon the Greeks by the same person, and in the same words too. We may indeed suppose the first feint to have remained undiscovered, but at best it is a management in the poet not very entertaining to the readers. Pope.</note>

<note n="28.5">5 Homer has shewn great judgment in the particulars he has chosen to compose the picture of a pernicious creature of wit; the chief of which are a desire of promoting laughter at any rate, and a contempt of his superiors. And he sums up the whole very strongly, by saying, that Thersites hated Achilles and Ulysses; in which, as Plutarch has remarked in his treatise of envy and hatred, he makes it the utmost completion of an ill character to bear a malevolence to the best men. What is farther observable is, that Thersites is never heard of after this, his first appearance: such a scandalous character is to be taken no more notice of, than just to shew that it is despised. The same conduct is observed with regard to the most deformed and most beautiful person of the poem: for Nireus is thus mentioned once, and no more throughout the Iliad. He places a worthless beauty and an ill-natured wit upon the same footing, and shews that the gifts of the body without those of the mind are not more despicable than those of the mind itself without virtue. Pope.</note>
<note n="28.6">6 "When the army," says Pope, "were offended at their general in favour of Achilles, nothing could more weaken Achilles' interest than to make such a fellow as Thersites appear of his party, whose impertinence would give them a disgust of thinking or acting like him. There is no surer method to reduce generous spirits, than to make them see they are pursuing the same views with people of no merit, and such whom they cannot forbear despising themselves. Had Nestor made this speech, the army had certainly set sail for Greece; but because it was uttered by a ridiculous fellow whom they are ashamed to follow, they are reduced, and satisfied to continue the siege."</note>

<note n="35.14">14 Homer, on the sight of the march of this numerous army, gives us five similes, but all entirely different. The first regards the splendour of their armour, as a fire, &amp;c. The second, the various movements of so many thousands before they can range themselves in battle array, like the swans, &amp;c. The third respects their number, as the leaves or flowers, &amp;c. The fourth, the ardour with which they run to the combat, like the legions of insects, &amp;c. And the fifth, the obedience and exact discipline of the troops, ranged without confusion under their leaders, as flocks under their shepherds. This fecundity and variety can never be enough admired.— Dacier. So when, at the close of the seventeenth book, he would give an adequate idea of the difficulty with which the body of Patroclus, so long a subject of contest, was at last rescued by Ajax and Menelaus, he expends five similes on the occasion; and three in the fifteenth, to magnify in our apprehension the force of Hector, and the firmness of the Grecians.

<note n="37.19">19 Thucydides remarks that the Bœotian vessels, which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably mentioned as the largest in the fleet; and those of Philoctetes, which carried fifty each, as the smallest; and that there were few men passengers, except the chiefs, the great majority being men for service in the field, who navigated the ships themselves. If, then, the total number of ships was twelve hundred, and their crews averaged eighty men each, the amount of the army would be about ninety-six thousand men. This is probably more than the real number, and Jacob Bryant, comparing it with the army at Platæa, thinks it so much of an exaggeration as to render the whole tale of the siege of Troy incredible.

<note n="44.25">25 Philoctetes, while he cleansed the altar of Minerva in Lemnos, was bitten by a serpent, and left there by the Greeks, because the priests of Vulcan were accounted singularly skilful in the cure of such wounds. But it was decreed in heaven, that, without the arrows of Hercules, Troy should not be taken, which arrows Philoctetes had in his possession, consigned to him by their owner at his death. The Greeks regretted him, therefore, as a person necessary to the success of their enterprise; and after the death of Achilles, Ulysses was despatched to Lemnos, that he might obtain the important arrows. He succeeded, and returned with them to the camp. Paris fell by one of them, and the destruction of Troy soon followed. Cowper.</note>

<note n="48.28">28 <p>If we look upon this Catalogue with an eye to ancient learning, it may be observed, that however fabulous the other parts of Homer's poem may be, according to the nature of Epic poetry, this account of the people, princes, and countries, is purely historical, founded on the real transactions of those times, and by far the most valuable piece of history and geography left us concerning the state of Greece in that early period. Greece was then divided into several Dynasties, which our author has enumerated under their respective princes; and his division was looked upon so exact, that we are told of many controversies concerning the boundaries of Grecian cities, which have been decided upon the authority of this piece. Eustathius <pb n="49"/> has collected together the following instances. The city of Calydon was adjudged to the Ætolians notwithstanding the pretensions of Æolia, because Homer had ranked it among the towns belonging to the former. Sestos was given to those of Abydos, upon the plea that he had said the Abydonians were possessors of Sestos, Abydos, and Arisbe. When the Milesians and people of Priene disputed their claim to Mycale, a verse of Homer carried it in favour of the Milesians. And the Athenians were put in possession of Salamis by another which was cited by Solon, or (as some think) interpolated by him for that purpose. Nay, in so high estimation has the catalogue been held, that (as Porphyry has written) there have been laws in some nations for the youth to learn it by heart, and particularly Cerdias, (whom Cuperus <quote xml:lang="lat">de Apophth. Homer.</quote> takes to be Cercydus, a lawgiver of the Megalopolitans,) made it one to his countrymen.</p>
  <p>But if we consider the catalogue purely as poetical, it will not want its beauties in that light. Rapin, who was none of the most superstitious admirers of our author, reckons it among those parts which had particularly charmed him. We may observe first, what an air of probability is spread over the whole poem by the particularizing of every nation and people concerned in this war. Secondly, what an entertaining scene he presents to us, of so many countries drawn in their liveliest and most natural colours, while we wander along with him amidst a beautiful variety of towns, havens, forests, vineyards, groves, mountains, and rivers; and are perpetually amused with his observations on the different soils, products, situations, or prospects. Thirdly, what a noble review he passes before us of so mighty an army, drawn out in order, troop by troop; which, had the number only been told in the gross, had never filled the reader with so great a notion of the importance of the action. Fourthly, the description of the differing arms and manner of fighting of the soldiers, and the various attitudes he has given to the commanders: of these leaders, the greatest part are either the immediate sons of gods, or the descendants of gods; and how great an idea must we have of a war, to the waging of which so many demi-gods and heroes are assembled! Fifthly, the several artful compliments he paid by this means to his own country in general, and many of his contemporaries in particular, by a celebration of the genealogies, ancient seats, and dominions of the great men of his time. Sixthly, the agreeable mixture of narrations from passages of history or fables, with which he amuses and relieves us at proper intervals. And lastly, the admirable judgment wherewith he introduces this whole catalogue, just at a time when the posture of affairs in the army rendered such a review of absolute necessity to the Greeks; and in a pause of action, while each was refreshing himself to prepare for the ensuing battles. Pope.</p></note>

<title type="sub">THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.</title>
</ab>
<p>The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the determina­ tion of the war. Iris is sent to call Helena to behold the fight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his counsellors, observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues, wherein Paris being overcome, is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Gre­ cians, demands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.</p>
<p>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The scene is sometimes in the field before Troy, and sometimes in Troy itself.</p>
<lg>
<l n="3.1">THUS by their leader's care each martial band</l>
<l n="3.2">Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.</l>
<l n="3.3">With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,</l>
<l n="3.4">Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war:</l>
</lg>
<note n="50.1">1 Of all the books of the Iliad, there is scarce any more pleasing than the third. It may be divided into five parts, each of which has a beauty different from the other. The first contains what passed between the two armies, and the proposal of the combat between Paris and Menelaus: the attention and suspense of these mighty hosts, which were just upon the point of joining battle, and the lofty manner of offering and accepting this important and unexpected challenge, have something in them wonderfully pompous, and of an amusing solemnity. The second part, which describes the behaviour of Helena in this juncture, her conference with the old king and his counsellors, with the review of the heroes from the battlements, is an episode entirely of another sort, which excels in the natural and pathetic. The third consists of the ceremonies of the oath on both sides, and the preliminaries to the combat; with the beautiful retreat of Priam, who, in the tenderness of a parent, withdraws from the sight of the duel. These particulars detain the reader in expectation, and heighten his impatience for the fight itself. The fourth is the description of the duel, an exact piece of painting, where we see every attitude, motion, and action of the combatants particularly and distinctly, and which concludes with a surprising propriety, in the rescue of Paris by Venus. The machine of that goddess, which makes the fifth part, and whose end is to reconcile Paris and Helena, is admirable in every circumstance; the remonstrance she holds with the goddess, the reluctance with which she obeys her, the reproaches she casts upon Paris, and the flattery and courtship with which he so soon wins her over to him. Helen (the main cause of this war) was not to be made an odious character; she is drawn by this great master with the finest strokes, as a frail, but not as an abandoned creature. She has perpetual struggles of virtue on one side, and softnesses which overcome them on the other. Our author has been remarkably careful to tell us this; whenever he but slightly names her in the foregoing part of his work, she is represented at the same time as repentant; and it is thus we see her at large at her first appearance in the present book; which is one of the shortest of the whole Iliad, but in recompense has beauties almost in every line, and most of them so obvious, that to acknowledge them we need only to read them. Pope.</note>

<l n="3.5">So when inclement winters vex the plain</l>
<l n="3.6">With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</l>
<l n="3.7">To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,</l>
<l n="3.8">With noise, and order, through the mid-way sky;</l>
<l n="3.9">To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,</l>
<l n="3.10">And all the war descends upon the wing.</l>
<l n="3.11">But silent, breathing rage, resolv'd, and skill'd</l>
<l n="3.12">By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,</l>
<l n="3.13">Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around</l>
<l n="3.14">Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.</l>
<l n="3.15">Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds</l>
<l n="3.16">A night of vapours round the mountain-heads,</l>
<l n="3.17">Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,</l>
<l n="3.18">To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;</l>
<l n="3.19">While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,</l>
<l n="3.20">Lost and confus'd amidst the thicken'd day:</l>
<l n="3.21">So, wrapt in gathering dust, the Grecian train,</l>
<l n="3.22">A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="3.23">Now front to front the hostile armies stand,</l>
<l n="3.24">Eager of fight, and only wait command:</l>
<l n="3.25">When, to the van, before the sons of fame</l>
<l n="3.26">Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came</l>
<l n="3.27">In form a god!<ref n="51.2">2</ref> the panther's speckled hide</l>
<l n="3.28">Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride;</l>
<l n="3.29">His bended bow across his shoulders flung,</l>
<l n="3.30">His sword beside him negligently hung;</l>
</lg>
<note n="51.2">2 The picture here given of Paris's air and dress, is exactly correspondent to his character; you see him endeavouring to mix the fine gentleman with the warrior; and this idea of him Homer takes care to keep up, by describing him not without the same regard, when he is arming to encounter Menelaus afterwards in a close fight, as he shows here where he is but preluding and flourishing in the gaiety of his heart. And when he tells us, in that place, that he was in danger of being strangled by the strap of his helmet, he takes notice that it was embroidered. Pope.</note>

<l n="3.33">As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,</l>
<l n="3.34">He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,</l>
<l n="3.35">Him Menelaus, lov'd of Mars, espies,</l>
<l n="3.36">With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:</l>
<l n="3.37">So joys a lion, if the branching deer</l>
<l n="3.38">Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;</l>
<l n="3.39">In vain the youths oppose, the mastiffs bay,</l>
<l n="3.40">The lordly savage rends the panting prey.</l>
<l n="3.41">Thus, fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,</l>
<l n="3.42">In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground</l>
<l n="3.43">From his high chariot: him, approaching near,</l>

<note n="52.3">3 This is the first place of the poem where Hector makes a figure, and if he is not the chief hero of the Iliad, he is at least the most amiable. He has no other blemish than that he fights in an unjust cause, which Homer has been careful to tell us he would not do, if his opinion were followed. But since he cannot prevail, the affection he bears to his parents and kindred, and his desire of defending them, incites him to do his utmost for their safety. It may be added, that Homer having so many Greeks to celebrate, makes them shine in their turns, and singly in their several books, one succeeding in the absence of another: whereas Hector appears in every battle the life and soul of his party, and the constant bulwark against every enemy: he stands against Agamemnon's magnanimity, Diomed's bravery, Ajax's strength, and Achilles' fury.

<l n="3.331">To join his milk-white coursers to the car:</l>
<l n="3.332">He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;</l>
<l n="3.333">The gentle steeds through Scæa's<ref n="59.12">12</ref> gates they guide:</l>
<l n="3.334">Next from the car, descending on the plain,</l>
<l n="3.335">Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train</l>
<l n="3.336">Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then</l>
<l n="3.337">Arose, and with him rose the king of men.</l>
<l n="3.338">On either side a sacred herald stands;</l>
<l n="3.339">The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands</l>
<l n="3.340">Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord</l>

<l n="3.342">From the sign'd victims crops the curling hair,</l>
<l n="3.343">The heralds part it, and the princes share;<ref n="59.13">13</ref></l>
<l n="3.344">Then loudly thus before th' attentive bands</l>
<l n="3.345">He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:</l>

<l n="3.418">The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:</l>
<l n="3.419">His figur'd shield, a shining orb, he takes,</l>

<l n="3.439">He said, and, pois'd in air, the javelin sent;</l>

<title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.</title>
</ab>
<p>The Gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the mean time some of the Tro­ jan troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some by praises, and others by reproofs. Nestor is particularly cele­ brated for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides.</p>
<p>The same day continues through this, as through the last book; as it does also through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh book. The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.</p>
<lg>
<l n="4.1">AND now Olympus' shining gates unfold;</l>
<l n="4.2">The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:</l>
<l n="4.3">Immortal Hebè, fresh with bloom divine,</l>
<l n="4.4">The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:</l>
<l n="4.5">While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ</l>
<l n="4.6">Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="4.7">When Jove, dispos'd to tempt Saturnia's spleen,</l>
<l n="4.8">Thus wak'd the fury of his partial queen:</l>
<l n="4.9">'Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,</l>
<l n="4.10">'Imperial Juno, and the martial maid:</l>
<l n="4.11">'But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,</l>
<l n="4.12">'The tame spectators of his deeds of war.</l>
<l n="4.13">'Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight,</l>
<l n="4.14">'The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,</l>
<l n="4.15">'Each danger wards, and, constant in her care,</l>
<l n="4.16">'Saves in the moment of the last despair.</l>
<l n="4.17">'Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life,</l>
<l n="4.18">'Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife.</l>
<l n="4.19">'Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits</l>
<l n="4.20">'To crown this deed, and finish all the Fates?</l>
</lg>
<pb n="66"/>
<lg>
<l n="4.21">'Shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,</l>
<l n="4.22">'Or rouse the Furies, and awake the war?</l>
<l n="4.23">'Yet, would the gods for human good provide,</l>
<l n="4.24">'Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,</l>
<l n="4.25">'Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,</l>
<l n="4.26">'And through his gates the crowding nations flow.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="4.27">Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enrag'd,</l>
<l n="4.28">And queen of war, in close consult engag'd:</l>
<l n="4.29">Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,</l>
<l n="4.30">And meditate the future woes of Troy.</l>
<l n="4.31">Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,</l>
<l n="4.32">The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;</l>
<l n="4.33">But Juno, impotent of passion, broke</l>
<l n="4.34">Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="4.35">'Shall then, O tyrant of th' ethereal reign!</l>
<l n="4.36">'My schemes, my labours, and my hopes, be vain?</l>
<l n="4.37">'Have I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms,</l>
<l n="4.38">'Assembled nations, set two worlds in arms?</l>
<l n="4.39">'To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore;</l>
<l n="4.40">'Th' immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.</l>

<note n="68.3">3 Both the horns together made this length, and not each, as Madame Dacier renders it. Pope. As the Greek palm was something more than three inches, the bow, if made of the two horns joined and uncurtailed, would be more than eight feet long; and Pope thought this would be an unmanageable size. But, as Clarke observes, the whole length of the horns may not here have been used. It is certainly probable that Homer meant that each horn was sixteen palms in length.</note>

<l n="4.400">'Say, is it thus those honours you requite?</l>
<l n="4.401">'The first in banquets, but the last in fight.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="4.402">Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread</l>
<l n="4.403">His cheek with blushes; and, severe, he said:</l>
<l n="4.404">'Take back th' unjust reproach! Behold we stand</l>
<l n="4.405">'Sheath'd in bright arms, and but expect command.</l>
<l n="4.406">'If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,</l>

<title type="sub">OBSERVATIONS ON HOMER'S BATTLES.</title>
</ab>
<p>IT may be necessary, at the opening of Homer's battles, to give some explanatory observations upon them. When we reflect that no less than the compass of twelve books is taken up in these, we shall have reason to wonder by what method the author could prevent descriptions of such a length from being tedious. It is not enough to say, that though the sub­ ject itself be the same, the actions are always different; that we have now distinct combats, now promiscuous fights, now single duels, now general engagements; or that the scenes are perpetually varied; we are now in the fields, now at the fortification of the Greeks, now at the ships, now at the gates of Troy, now at the river Scamander: but we must look farther into the art of the poet to find the reasons of this astonishing variety.</p>
<p>We first observe that diversity in the deaths of his warriors, which he has supplied by the vastest fertility of invention. These he distinguishes several ways: sometimes by the characters of the men, their age, office, profession, nation, family, &amp;c. One is a blooming youth, whose father dis­ suaded him from the war; one is a priest, whose piety could not save him; one is a sportsman, whom Diana taught in vain; one is the native of a far distant country, who is never to return; one is descended from a noble line, which ends in his death; one is made remarkable by his boasting; another by his beseeching; and another, who is distinguished no way else, is marked by his habit, and the singularity of his armour.</p>
<p>Sometimes he varies these by the several postures in which his heroes are represented either fighting or falling. Some of these are so exceedingly exact, that one may guess, from the very position of the combatant, where­ abouts the wound will light: others so very peculiar and uncommon, that they could only be the effect of an imagination which had searched through all the ideas of nature. Such is that picture of Mydon in the fifth book, whose arm being numbed by a blow on the elbow, drops the reins, that trail on the ground; and then being suddenly struck on the temples, falls headlong from the chariot, in a soft and deep place, where he sinks up to the shoulders in the sands, and continues a while fixed by the weight of his armour, with his legs quivering in the air, till he is trampled down by his horses.</p>
<pb n="81"/>
<p>Another cause of this variety is the difference of the wounds that are given in the Iliad: they are by no means like the wounds described by most other poets, which are commonly made in the self-same obvious places; the heart and head serve for all those in general who understand no ana­ tomy, and sometimes, for variety, they kill men by wounds that are no where mortal but in their poems. As the whole human body is the subject of these, so nothing is more necessary to him who would describe them well, than a thorough knowledge of its structure, even though the poet is not professedly to write of them as an anatomist; in the same manner as an exact skill in anatomy is necessary to those painters that would excel in drawing the naked body, though they are not to make every muscle as visible as in a book of chirurgery. It appears from so many passages in Homer, that he was perfectly master of this science, that it would be need­ less to cite any in particular.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to take notice of some customs of antiquity relating to the arms and art military of those times, which are proper to be known, in order to form a right notion of our author's descriptions of war.</p>
<p>That Homer copied the manners and customs of the age he wrote of, rather than of that he lived in, has been observed in some instances. As that he nowhere represents cavalry or trumpets to have been used in the Trojan wars, though they apparently were in his own time. It is not there­ fore impossible but there may be found in his works some deficiencies in the art of war, which are not to be imputed to his ignorance, but to his judgment.</p>
<p>Horses had not been brought into Greece long before the siege of Troy. They were originally eastern animals, and if we find at that very period so great a number of them reckoned up in the wars of the Israelites, it is the less a wonder, considering they came from Asia. The practice of riding them was so little known in Greece a few years before, that they looked upon the Centaurs who first used it, as monsters compounded of men and horses. Nestor, in the first Iliad, says he had seen these Centaurs in his youth, and Polypœtes in the second is said to have been born on the day that his father expelled them from Pelion to the deserts of Æthica. They had no other use of horses than to draw their chariots in battle, so that whenever Homer speaks of fighting from a horse, taming a horse, or the like, it is constantly to be understood of fighting from a chariot, or taming horses to that service. This was a piece of decorum in the poet; for in his own time they were arrived to such a perfection in horsemanship, that in the fifteenth Iliad, ver. 822, we have a simile taken from an extraordinary feat of activity, where one man manages four horses at once, and leaps from the back of one to another at full speed.</p>
<p>If we consider in what high esteem among warriors these noble animals must have been at their first coming into Greece, we shall the less wonder at the frequent occasions Homer has taken to describe and celebrate them. It is not so strange to find them set almost upon a level with men, at the time when a horse in the prizes was of equal value with a captive.</p>
<p>The chariots were in all probability very low. For we frequently find in the Iliad, that a person who stands erect on a chariot is killed, (and sometimes by a stroke on the head,) by a foot soldier with a sword. This may farther appear from the ease and readiness with which they alight or</p>
<pb n="82"/>
<p>mount on every occasion, to facilitate which, the chariots were made open behind. That the wheels were but small, may be guessed from a custom they had of taking them off and setting them on, as they were laid by, or made use of. Hebe in the fifth book puts on the wheels of Juno's chariot when she calls for it in haste: and it seems to be with allusion to the same practice that it is said in Exodus, ch. xiv., The Lord took off their chariot- wheels, so that they drove them heavily. The sides were also low; for who­ ever is killed in his chariot throughout the poem, constantly falls to the ground, as having nothing to support him. That the whole machine was very small and light, is evident from a passage in the tenth Iliad, where Diomed debates whether he shall draw the chariot of Rhesus out of the way, or carry it on his shoulders to a place of safety. All the particulars agree with the representations of the chariots on the most ancient Greek coins; where the tops of them reached not so high as the backs of the horses; the wheels are yet lower, and the heroes who stand in them are seen from the knee upwards.</p>
<p>There were generally two persons in each chariot, one of whom was wholly employed in guiding the horses. They used indifferently, two, three, or four horses: from whence it happens, that sometimes when a horse is killed, the hero continues the fight with the two or more that re­ main; and at other times a warrior retreats upon the loss of one; not that he had less courage than the other, but that he has fewer horses.</p>
<p>Their swords were all broad cutting swords, for we find they never stab but with their spears. The spears were used two ways, either to push with, or to cast from them, like the missive javelins. It seems surprising, that a man should throw a dart or spear with such force, as to pierce through both sides of the armour and the body (as is often described in Homer): for if the strength of the men was gigantic, the armour must have been strong in proportion. Some solution might be given for this, if we ima­ gined the armour was generally brass, and the weapons pointed with iron; and if we could fancy that Homer called the spears and swords brazen, in the same manner that he calls the reins of a bridle ivory, only from the or­ naments about them. But there are passages where the point of the spear is expressly said to be of brass, as in the description of that of Hector in Iliad vi. Pausanias (Laconicis) takes it for granted, that the arms, as well offensive as defensive, were brass. He says the spear of Achilles was kept in his time in the temple of Minerva, the top and point of which were of brass; and the sword of Meriones, in that of Æsculapius among the Nicomedians, was entirely of the same metal. But be it as it will, there are examples even at this day of such a prodigious force in casting darts, as almost exceeds credibility. The Turks and Arabs will pierce through thick planks with darts of hardened wood; which can only be attributed to their being bred (as the ancients were) to that exercise, and to the strength and agility acquired by a constant practice of it.</p>
<p>We may ascribe to the same cause their power of casting stones of a vast weight, which appears a common practice in these battles. It is an error to imagine this to be only a fictitious embellishment of the poet, which was one of the exercises of war among the ancient Greeks and Orientals. St. Jerome tells us, it was an old custom in Palestine, and in use in his own time, to have round stones of a great weight kept in the castles and vil­ lages, for the youth to try their strength with.</p>

<title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>

<ab>
<title type="sub">THE ACTS OF DIOMED.</title>
</ab>
<p>Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle. Pan­ darus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending with any of the former, excepting Venus. Æneas joins Pandarus to oppose him, Pandarus is killed, and Æneas in great danger but for the assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and, at length, carries off Æneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand. In the mean time Æneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter in­ cites Diomed to go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.</p>
<p>The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in the former.</p>
<lg>
<l n="5.1">BUT Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,</l>
<l n="5.2">Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,</l>
<l n="5.3">Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,</l>
<l n="5.4">And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.</l>
<l n="5.5">High on his helm celestial lightnings play,</l>
<l n="5.6">His beamy shield emits a living ray;</l>
<l n="5.7">Th' unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,</l>
<l n="5.8">Like the red star that fires th' autumnal skies,</l>
<l n="5.9">When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,</l>
<l n="5.10">And bath'd in Ocean shoots a keener light.</l>
<l n="5.11">Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd,</l>
<l n="5.12">Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd:</l>
<l n="5.13">Onward she drives him, furious to engage,</l>
<l n="5.14">Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.15">The sons of Dares first the combat sought,</l>
<l n="5.16">A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;</l>
<l n="5.17">In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led;</l>
<l n="5.18">The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;</l>
<l n="5.19">These, singled from their troops, the fight maintain;</l>
<l n="5.20">These from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.</l>
<l n="5.21">Fierce for renown the brother chiefs draw near,</l>
<l n="5.22">And first bold Phegeus casts his sounding spear,</l>
<l n="5.23">Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,</l>
<l n="5.24">And spent in empty air its erring force.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="84"/>
<lg>
<l n="5.25">Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,</l>
<l n="5.26">But pierc'd his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.</l>
<l n="5.27">Seiz'd with unusual fear, Idæus fled,</l>
<l n="5.28">Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead;</l>
<l n="5.29">And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,</l>
<l n="5.30">He too had sunk to death's eternal shade;</l>
<l n="5.31">But in a smoky cloud the god of fire</l>
<l n="5.32">Preserv'd the son, in pity to the sire.</l>
<l n="5.33">The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,</l>
<l n="5.34">Increas'd the spoils of gallant Diomed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.35">Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew</l>
<l n="5.36">Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;</l>
<l n="5.37">When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd</l>
<l n="5.38">The god of battles, and this speech address'd:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.39">'Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,</l>
<l n="5.40">'Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!</l>
<l n="5.41">'Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;</l>
<l n="5.42">'And whose the conquest mighty Jove decide:</l>
<l n="5.43">'While we from interdicted fields retire,</l>
<l n="5.44">'Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.45">Her words allay th' impetuous warrior's heat,</l>
<l n="5.46">The god of arms and martial maid retreat;</l>
<l n="5.47">Remov'd from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds</l>
<l n="5.48">They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.49">Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,</l>
<l n="5.50">And some bold chieftain every leader slew:</l>
<l n="5.51">First Odius falls and bites the bloody sand,</l>
<l n="5.52">His death ennobled by Atrides' hand;</l>
<l n="5.53">As he to flight his wheeling car address'd,</l>
<l n="5.54">The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.</l>
<l n="5.55">In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,</l>
<l n="5.56">His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.57">Thy fate was next, O Phæstus! doom'd to feel</l>
<l n="5.58">The great Idomeneus' protended steel;</l>
<l n="5.59">Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)</l>
<l n="5.60">From fruitful Tarné<ref n="84.1">1</ref> to the fields of Troy.</l>
<l n="5.61">The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,</l>
<l n="5.62">And pierc'd his shoulder as he mounts his car;</l>
<l n="5.63">Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,</l>
<l n="5.64">And everlasting shades his eyes surround.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.65">Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,</l>
<l n="5.66">In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;</l>
<l n="5.67">Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,</l>
<l n="5.68">To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts;</l>

<lg>
<l n="5.69">But vainly here Diana's arts he tries,</l>
<l n="5.70">The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;</l>
<l n="5.71">From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,</l>
<l n="5.72">Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:</l>
<l n="5.73">Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,</l>
<l n="5.74">His brazen armour rings against the ground.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.75">Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;</l>
<l n="5.76">Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.</l>
<l n="5.77">Thy father's skill, O Phereclus, was thine,</l>
<l n="5.78">The graceful fabric and the fair design;</l>
<l n="5.79">For, lov'd by Pallas, Pallas did impart</l>
<l n="5.80">To him the shipwright's and the builder's art,</l>
<l n="5.81">Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,</l>
<l n="5.82">The fatal cause of all his country's woes;</l>
<l n="5.83">But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,</l>
<l n="5.84">Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.</l>
<l n="5.85">The hapless artist, while confus'd he fled,</l>
<l n="5.86">The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.</l>
<l n="5.87">Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,</l>
<l n="5.88">Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd;</l>
<l n="5.89">Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,</l>
<l n="5.90">And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.91">From Meges' force the swift Pedæus fled,</l>
<l n="5.92">Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed;</l>
<l n="5.93">Whose generous spouse, Theano, heavenly fair,</l>
<l n="5.94">Nurs'd the young stranger with a mother's care.</l>
<l n="5.95">How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear</l>
<l n="5.96">Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;</l>
<l n="5.97">Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,</l>
<l n="5.98">And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.99">Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,</l>
<l n="5.100">Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,</l>
<l n="5.101">Who near ador'd Scamander made abode,</l>
<l n="5.102">Priest of the stream, and honour'd as a god.</l>
<l n="5.103">On him, amidst the flying numbers found,</l>
<l n="5.104">Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;</l>
<l n="5.105">On his broad shoulder fell the forceful brand,</l>
<l n="5.106">Thence glancing downward lopp'd his holy hand,</l>
<l n="5.107">Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.</l>
<l n="5.108">Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death</l>
<l n="5.109">Clos'd his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.110">Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engag'd,</l>
<l n="5.111">In every quarter fierce Tydides rag'd,</l>
<l n="5.112">Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,</l>
<l n="5.113">Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;</l>
<l n="5.114">Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,</l>
<l n="5.115">Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="86"/>
<lg>
<l n="5.116">Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong</l>
<l n="5.117">Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along;</l>
<l n="5.118">Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,</l>
<l n="5.119">O'erwhelms the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;</l>
<l n="5.120">The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,</l>
<l n="5.121">And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!</l>
<l n="5.122">While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,</l>
<l n="5.123">And all the labours of mankind are vain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.124">So rag'd Tydides, boundless in his ire,</l>
<l n="5.125">Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.</l>
<l n="5.126">With grief the leader<ref n="86.2">2</ref> of the Lycian band</l>
<l n="5.127">Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:</l>
<l n="5.128">His bended bow against the chief he drew;</l>
<l n="5.129">Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,</l>
<l n="5.130">Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,</l>
<l n="5.131">Deep in his shoulder pierc'd, and drank the gore;</l>
<l n="5.132">The rushing stream his brazen armour dy'd,</l>
<l n="5.133">While the proud archer thus exulting cried:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.134">'Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!</l>
<l n="5.135">'Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds.</l>
<l n="5.136">'Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;</l>
<l n="5.137">'Or Phœbus urg'd me to these fields in vain.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.138">So spoke he, boastful; but the winged dart</l>
<l n="5.139">Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.</l>
<l n="5.140">The wounded chief, behind his car retir'd,</l>
<l n="5.141">The helping hand of Sthenelus requir'd;</l>
<l n="5.142">Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,</l>
<l n="5.143">And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound;</l>
<l n="5.144">When thus the king his guardian power address'd,</l>
<l n="5.145">The purple current wandering o'er his vest:</l>

<lg>
<l n="5.146">'O progeny of Jove! unconquer'd maid!</l>
<l n="5.147">'If e'er my godlike sire deserv'd thy aid,</l>

<l n="5.157">His beating bosom claims the promis'd fight.</l>

<lg>
<l n="5.218">'Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,</l>
<l n="5.219">'Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,</l>
<l n="5.220">'Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,</l>
<l n="5.221">'And boasted glory of the Lycian name?</l>

<l n="5.223">'That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;</l>
<l n="5.224">'Or god incens'd, who quits the distant skies</l>

<l n="5.228">'Whoe'er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;</l>
<l n="5.229">'If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.'</l>

<lg>
<l n="5.230">To him the Lycian: 'Whom your eyes behold,</l>
<l n="5.231">'If right I judge, is Diomed the bold.</l>
<l n="5.232">'Such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,</l>
<l n="5.233">'So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.</l>
<l n="5.234">'If 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise;</l>
<l n="5.235">'Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,</l>
<l n="5.236">'Involv'd in clouds, protects him in the fray,</l>
<l n="5.237">'And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.</l>
<l n="5.238">'I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell;</l>
<l n="5.239">'The stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell;</l>
<l n="5.240">'And, but some god, some angry god withstands,</l>
<l n="5.241">'His fate was due to these unerring hands.</l>
<l n="5.242">'Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war,</l>
<l n="5.243">'Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.</l>
<l n="5.244">'Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,</l>
<l n="5.245">'And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome:</l>
<l n="5.246">'There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand;</l>
<l n="5.247">'And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.</l>
<l n="5.248">'The good old warrior bade me trust to these,</l>
<l n="5.249">'When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas;</l>
<l n="5.250">'In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,</l>
<l n="5.251">'And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.</l>

<l n="5.252">'But, vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclin'd,</l>

<l n="5.255">'Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town:</l>

<l n="5.259">'These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.</l>
<l n="5.260">'Tydeus' and Atreus' sons their points have found,</l>

<l n="5.262">'In vain they bled: this unavailing bow</l>
<l n="5.263">'Serves not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.</l>
<l n="5.264">'In evil hour these bended horns I strung,</l>
<l n="5.265">'And seiz'd the quiver where it idly hung.</l>

<l n="5.290">'The horses, practis'd to their lord's command,</l>

<l n="5.292">'But if, unhappy, we desert the fight,</l>

<l n="5.298">And now both heroes mount the glittering car;</l>
<l n="5.299">The bounding coursers rush amidst the war.</l>
<l n="5.300">Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,</l>
<l n="5.301">Who thus, alarm'd, to great Tydides cried:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.302">'O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,</l>
<l n="5.303">'Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:</l>
<l n="5.304">'Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon's line,</l>
<l n="5.305">'And great Æneas, sprung from race divine!</l>
<l n="5.306">'Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car;</l>
<l n="5.307">'And save a life, the bulwark of our war.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.308">At this the hero cast a gloomy look,</l>
<l n="5.309">Fix'd on the chief with scorn, and thus he spoke:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.310">'Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?</l>
<l n="5.311">'Me would'st thou move to base, inglorious flight?</l>
<l n="5.312">'Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,</l>
<l n="5.313">'Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.</l>
<l n="5.314">'I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,</l>
<l n="5.315">'And the long distance of the flying lance:</l>
<l n="5.316">'But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,</l>
<l n="5.317">'Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.</l>
<l n="5.318">'Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey</l>
<l n="5.319">'Those threat'ning heroes, bear them both away;</l>
<l n="5.320">'One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;</l>
<l n="5.321">'So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.</l>
<l n="5.322">'But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,</l>
<l n="5.323">'That both shall fall by one victorious hand;</l>
<l n="5.324">'Then heed my words: my horses here detain,</l>
<l n="5.325">'Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein;</l>
<l n="5.326">'Swift to Æneas' empty seat proceed,</l>
<l n="5.327">'And seize the coursers of ethereal breed,</l>
<l n="5.328">'The race of those, which once the thundering god</l>
<l n="5.329">'For ravish'd Ganymede on Tros bestow'd,</l>
<l n="5.330">'The best that e'er on earth's broad surface run</l>
<l n="5.331">'Beneath the rising or the setting sun.</l>
<l n="5.332">'Hence great Anchises stole a breed, unknown</l>
<l n="5.333">'By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:</l>
<l n="5.334">'Four of this race his ample stalls contain,</l>
<l n="5.335">'And two transport Æneas o'er the plain.</l>
<l n="5.336">'These, were the rich immortal prize our own,</l>
<l n="5.337">'Thro' the wide world should make our glory known.'</l>
</lg>
<pb n="91"/>

<lg>
<l n="5.338">Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,</l>
<l n="5.339">And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun:</l>
<l n="5.340">'Prince, thou art met. Tho' late in vain assail'd,</l>
<l n="5.341">'The spear may enter where the arrow fail'd.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.342">He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;</l>
<l n="5.343">On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,</l>
<l n="5.344">Pierc'd the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung.</l>
<l n="5.345">'He bleeds! the pride of Greece!' (the boaster cries,)</l>
<l n="5.346">'Our triumph now the mighty warrior lies!'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.347">'Mistaken vaunter!' Diomed replied;</l>
<l n="5.348">'Thy dart has err'd, and now my spear be tried:</l>
<l n="5.349">'Ye 'scape not both; one, headlong from his car,</l>
<l n="5.350">'With hostile blood shall glut the god of war.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.351">He spoke, and, rising, hurl'd his forceful dart,</l>
<l n="5.352">Which, driven by Pallas, pierc'd a vital part;</l>
<l n="5.353">Full in his face it enter'd, and betwixt</l>
<l n="5.354">The nose and eyeball the proud Lycian fix'd:</l>
<l n="5.355">Crash'd all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,</l>
<l n="5.356">Till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.</l>
<l n="5.357">Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground;</l>
<l n="5.358">Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;</l>
<l n="5.359">The starting coursers tremble with affright;</l>
<l n="5.360">The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.361">To guard his slaughter'd friend, Æneas flies,</l>
<l n="5.362">His spear extending where the carcass lies;</l>
<l n="5.363">Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,</l>
<l n="5.364">As the grim lion stalks around his prey.</l>
<l n="5.365">O'er the fallen trunk his ample shield display'd,</l>
<l n="5.366">He hides the hero with his mighty shade,</l>
<l n="5.367">And threats aloud: the Greeks with longing eyes</l>
<l n="5.368">Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.</l>
<l n="5.369">Then fierce Tydides stoops; and, from the fields</l>
<l n="5.370">Heav'd with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.</l>
<l n="5.371">Not two strong men th' enormous weight could raise,</l>
<l n="5.372">Such men as live in these degenerate days.</l>
<l n="5.373">He swung it round; and, gath'ring strength to throw,</l>
<l n="5.374">Discharg'd the ponderous ruin at the foe.</l>
<l n="5.375">Where to the hip th' inserted thigh unites,</l>
<l n="5.376">Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;</l>
<l n="5.377">Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,</l>
<l n="5.378">And stripp'd the skin, and crack'd the solid bone.</l>
<l n="5.379">Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,</l>
<l n="5.380">His falling bulk his bended arms sustains;</l>
<l n="5.381">Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;</l>
<l n="5.382">A sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes.</l>
<l n="5.383">There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd,</l>
<l n="5.384">Oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade;</l>
</lg>
<pb n="92"/>
<lg>
<l n="5.385">But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love</l>
<l n="5.386">She bore Anchises in th' Idæan grove,</l>
<l n="5.387">His danger views with anguish and despair,</l>
<l n="5.388">And guards her offspring with a mother's care.</l>
<l n="5.389">About her much-lov'd son her arms she throws,</l>
<l n="5.390">Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.</l>
<l n="5.391">Screen'd from the foe behind her shining veil,</l>
<l n="5.392">The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail:</l>
<l n="5.393">Safe through the rushing horse, and feather'd flight</l>
<l n="5.394">Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.395">Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,</l>
<l n="5.396">Remain'd unheedful of his lord's commands:</l>
<l n="5.397">His panting steeds, remov'd from out the war,</l>
<l n="5.398">He fix'd with straiten'd traces to the car.</l>
<l n="5.399">Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains</l>
<l n="5.400">The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:</l>
<l n="5.401">These, in proud triumph to the fleet convey'd,</l>
<l n="5.402">No longer now a Trojan lord obey'd.</l>
<l n="5.403">That charge to bold Deïpylus he gave,</l>
<l n="5.404">(Whom most he lov'd, as brave men love the brave,)</l>
<l n="5.405">Then, mounting on his car, resum'd the rein,</l>
<l n="5.406">And follow'd where Tydides swept the plain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.407">Meanwhile (his conquest ravish'd from his eyes)</l>
<l n="5.408">The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:</l>
<l n="5.409">No goddess she commission'd to the field,</l>
<l n="5.410">Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,</l>
<l n="5.411">Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,</l>
<l n="5.412">While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;</l>
<l n="5.413">He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,</l>
<l n="5.414">New to the field, and still a foe to fame.</l>
<l n="5.415">Thro' breaking ranks his furious course he bends,</l>
<l n="5.416">And at the goddess his broad lance extends;</l>
<l n="5.417">Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,</l>
<l n="5.418">Th' ambrosial veil, which all the Graces wove:</l>
<l n="5.419">Her snowy hand the razing steel profan'd,</l>
<l n="5.420">And the transparent skin with crimson stain'd.</l>
<l n="5.421">From the clear vein a stream immortal flow'd,</l>
<l n="5.422">Such stream as issues from a wounded god;</l>
<l n="5.423">Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood;</l>
<l n="5.424">Unlike our gross, diseas'd, terrestrial blood:</l>
<l n="5.425">(For not the bread of man their life sustains,</l>
<l n="5.426">Nor wine's inflaming juice supplies their veins.)</l>
<l n="5.427">With tender shrieks the goddess fill'd the place,</l>
<l n="5.428">And dropp'd her offspring from her weak embrace.</l>
<l n="5.429">Him Phœbus took: he casts a cloud around</l>
<l n="5.430">The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="93"/>

<lg>
<l n="5.431">Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,</l>

<l n="5.437">'Taught by this stroke, renounce the war's alarms,</l>

<l n="5.440">Confus'd, distracted, from the conflict fled.</l>

<l n="5.445">To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way;</l>
<l n="5.446">Far on the left, with clouds involv'd he lay;</l>
<l n="5.447">Beside him stood his lance, distain'd with gore,</l>
<l n="5.448">And, rein'd with gold, his foaming steeds before:</l>

<l n="5.451">And shew'd the wound by fierce Tydides given,</l>
<l n="5.452">A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.</l>
<l n="5.453">Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,</l>

<l n="5.506">The sacred ichor, and infus'd the balm.</l>
<l n="5.507">Juno and Pallas with a smile survey'd,</l>
<l n="5.508">And thus to Jove began the blue-ey'd maid:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.509">'Permit thy daughter, gracious Jove! to tell</l>
<l n="5.510">'How this mischance the Cyprian queen befel.</l>
<l n="5.511">'As late she tried with passion to inflame</l>
<l n="5.512">'The tender bosom of a Grecian dame,</l>
<l n="5.513">'Allur'd the fair with moving thoughts of joy,</l>
<l n="5.514">'To quit her country for some youth of Troy;</l>
<l n="5.515">'The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,</l>
<l n="5.516">'Raz'd her soft hand with this lamented wound.'</l>

<lg>
<l n="5.517">The sire of gods and men superior smil'd,</l>
<l n="5.518">And, calling Venus, thus address'd his child:</l>
<l n="5.519">'Not these, O daughter, are thy proper cares,</l>
<l n="5.520">'Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;</l>
<l n="5.521">'Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;</l>
<l n="5.522">'To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.523">Thus they in heaven. While on the plain below</l>
<l n="5.524">The fierce Tydides charg'd his Dardan foe,</l>
<l n="5.525">Flush'd with celestial blood pursu'd his way,</l>
<l n="5.526">And fearless dar'd the threat'ning god of day;</l>
<l n="5.527">Already in his hopes he saw him kill'd,</l>
<l n="5.528">Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield.</l>
<l n="5.529">Thrice, rushing furious, at the chief he struck;</l>
<l n="5.530">His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:</l>
<l n="5.531">He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,</l>
<l n="5.532">A more than mortal voice was heard aloud:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.533">'O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise, and see</l>
<l n="5.534">'How vast the difference of the gods and thee;</l>
<l n="5.535">'Distance immense! between the powers that shine</l>
<l n="5.536">'Above, eternal, deathless, and divine,</l>
<l n="5.537">'And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,</l>
<l n="5.538">'A short liv'd reptile in the dust of earth.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.539">So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;</l>
<l n="5.540">He dreads his fury, and some steps retires.</l>
<l n="5.541">Then Phœbus bore the chief of Venus' race</l>
<l n="5.542">To Troy's high fane, and to his holy place;</l>
<l n="5.543">Latona there and Phœbe heal'd the wound;</l>
<l n="5.544">With vigour arm'd him, and with glory crown'd.</l>
<l n="5.545">This done, the patron of the silver bow</l>
<l n="5.546">A phantom rais'd, the same in shape and show</l>
<l n="5.547">With great Æneas; such the form he bore,</l>
<l n="5.548">And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.</l>
<l n="5.549">Around the spectre bloody wars are wag'd,</l>
<l n="5.550">And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engag'd.</l>
<l n="5.551">Meantime on Ilion's tower Apollo stood,</l>
<l n="5.552">And, calling Mars, thus urg'd the raging god:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.553">'Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall,</l>
<l n="5.554">'Who bathe in blood, and shake th' embattled wall!</l>
<l n="5.555">'Rise in thy wrath! to hell's abhorr'd abodes</l>
<l n="5.556">'Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.</l>
<l n="5.557">'First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;</l>
<l n="5.558">'Me next he charg'd, and dares all heaven engage:</l>
<l n="5.559">'The wretch would brave high heaven's immortal sire,</l>
<l n="5.560">'His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.561">The god of battles issues on the plain,</l>
<l n="5.562">Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train:</l>
</lg>
<pb n="96"/>
<lg>
<l n="5.563">In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,</l>
<l n="5.564">Enrag'd, to Troy's retiring chiefs he cried:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.565">'How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,</l>
<l n="5.566">'And unreveng'd see Priam's people die?</l>
<l n="5.567">'Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,</l>
<l n="5.568">'And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?</l>
<l n="5.569">'Lo, brave Æneas sinks beneath his wound,</l>
<l n="5.570">'Not godlike Hector more in arms renown'd:</l>
<l n="5.571">'Haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.'</l>
<l n="5.572">He said; new courage swell'd each hero's heart.</l>
<l n="5.573">Sarpedon first his ardent soul express'd,</l>
<l n="5.574">And, turn'd to Hector, these bold words address'd;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.575">'Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?</l>
<l n="5.576">'Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,</l>
<l n="5.577">'That, propp'd alone by Priam's race should stand,</l>
<l n="5.578">'Troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?</l>
<l n="5.579">'Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,</l>
<l n="5.580">'And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.</l>
<l n="5.581">'Remote they stand, while alien troops engage,</l>
<l n="5.582">'Like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.</l>
<l n="5.583">'Far distant hence I held my wide command,</l>
<l n="5.584">'Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land,</l>
<l n="5.585">'With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless'd,</l>
<l n="5.586">'A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;</l>
<l n="5.587">'With those I left whatever dear could be;</l>
<l n="5.588">'Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me.</l>
<l n="5.589">'Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,</l>
<l n="5.590">'And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;</l>
<l n="5.591">'While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave</l>
<l n="5.592">'Their wives, their infants, and their altars, save.</l>
<l n="5.593">'Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state;</l>
<l n="5.594">'Or one vast burst of all-involving fate</l>
<l n="5.595">'Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away</l>
<l n="5.596">'Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.</l>
<l n="5.597">'Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;</l>
<l n="5.598">'These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night:</l>
<l n="5.599">'With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;</l>
<l n="5.600">'Such care thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.601">Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,</l>
<l n="5.602">But just reproof with decent silence bears.</l>
<l n="5.603">From his proud car the prince impetuous springs;</l>
<l n="5.604">On earth he leaps; his brazen armour rings.</l>
<l n="5.605">Two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands;</l>
<l n="5.606">Thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,</l>
<l n="5.607">Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</l>
<l n="5.608">And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="97"/>

<lg>
<l n="5.609">They turn, they stand: the Greeks their fury dare,</l>
<l n="5.610">Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.611">As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain</l>
<l n="5.612">Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,</l>
<l n="5.613">And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,</l>
<l n="5.614">Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;</l>
<l n="5.615">The grey dust, rising with collected winds,</l>
<l n="5.616">Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:</l>
<l n="5.617">So, white with dust, the Grecian host appears,</l>
<l n="5.618">From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers.</l>
<l n="5.619">The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,</l>
<l n="5.620">And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.</l>
<l n="5.621">Mars hovers o'er them with his sable shield,</l>
<l n="5.622">And adds new horrors to the darken'd field;</l>
<l n="5.623">Pleas'd with this charge, and ardent to fulfil</l>
<l n="5.624">In Troy's defence, Apollo's heavenly will:</l>
<l n="5.625">Soon as from fight the blue-ey'd maid retires,</l>
<l n="5.626">Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.</l>
<l n="5.627">And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,</l>
<l n="5.628">Produc'd Æneas to the shouting train;</l>
<l n="5.629">Alive, unharm'd, with all his peers around,</l>
<l n="5.630">Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:</l>
<l n="5.631">Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day</l>
<l n="5.632">No pause of words admits, no dull delay;</l>
<l n="5.633">Fierce discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,</l>
<l n="5.634">Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.635">Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,</l>
<l n="5.636">And great Ulysses, bath'd in hostile blood.</l>
<l n="5.637">Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train</l>
<l n="5.638">The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain;</l>
<l n="5.639">Unmov'd and silent, the whole war they wait,</l>
<l n="5.640">Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.</l>
<l n="5.641">So, when th' embattled clouds in dark array</l>
<l n="5.642">Along the skies their gloomy lines display,</l>
<l n="5.643">When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,</l>
<l n="5.644">And peaceful sleeps the liquid element,</l>
<l n="5.645">The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,</l>
<l n="5.646">Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;</l>
<l n="5.647">Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,</l>
<l n="5.648">Dispers'd and broken, through the ruffled skies.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.649">Nor was the general wanting to his train;</l>
<l n="5.650">From troop to troop he toils thro' all the plain:</l>
<l n="5.651">'Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;</l>
<l n="5.652">'Your brave associates, and yourselves revere!</l>
<l n="5.653">'Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,</l>

</lg>

<l n="5.655">'On valour's side the odds of combat lie,</l>
<l n="5.656">'The brave live glorious, or lamented die;</l>
<l n="5.657">'The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,</l>
<l n="5.658">'Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.'</l>
</lg>

<l n="5.659">These words he seconds with his flying lance,</l>
<l n="5.660">To meet whose point was strong Deicoön's chance:</l>
<l n="5.661">Æneas' friend, and in his native place</l>
<l n="5.662">Honour'd and lov'd like Priam's royal race:</l>
<l n="5.663">Long had he fought, the foremost in the field;</l>
<l n="5.664">But now the monarch's lance transpierc'd his shield:</l>
<l n="5.665">His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,</l>
<l n="5.666">Through his broad belt the weapon forc'd its way;</l>
<l n="5.667">The grisly wound dismiss'd his soul to hell,</l>
<l n="5.668">His arms around him rattled as he fell.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.669">Then fierce Æneas, brandishing his blade,</l>
<l n="5.670">In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,</l>
<l n="5.671">Whose sire Diöcleus, wealthy, brave, and great,</l>
<l n="5.672">In well-built Pheræ held his lofty seat:</l>
<l n="5.673">Sprung from Alpheus, plenteous stream! that yields</l>
<l n="5.674">Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields:</l>
<l n="5.675">He got Orsilochus, Diöcles he,</l>
<l n="5.676">And these descended in the third degree.</l>
<l n="5.677">Too early expert in the martial toil,</l>
<l n="5.678">In sable ships they left their native soil,</l>
<l n="5.679">'T avenge Atrides; now, untimely slain,</l>
<l n="5.680">They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.</l>
<l n="5.681">So two young mountain lions, nurs'd with blood</l>
<l n="5.682">In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,</l>
<l n="5.683">Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd</l>
<l n="5.684">Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold;</l>
<l n="5.685">Till, pierc'd at distance from their native den,</l>
<l n="5.686">O'erpower'd they fall beneath the force of men.</l>
<l n="5.687">Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,</l>
<l n="5.688">Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.</l>
<l n="5.689">Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,</l>
<l n="5.690">Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;</l>
<l n="5.691">Mars urg'd him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,</l>
<l n="5.692">The god but urg'd him to provoke his fate.</l>
<l n="5.693">He thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son</l>
<l n="5.694">Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;</l>

<l n="5.701">These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his course,</l>

<l n="5.703">The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew;</l>
<l n="5.704">Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.705">First Pylæmenes, great in battle, bled,</l>

<l n="5.707">Atrides mark'd him where sublime he stood;</l>
<l n="5.708">Fix'd in his throat, the javelin drank his blood.</l>
<l n="5.709">The faithful Mydon, as he turn'd from fight</l>
<l n="5.710">His flying coursers, sunk to endless night:</l>
<l n="5.711">A broken rock by Nestor's son was thrown;</l>
<l n="5.712">His bended arm receiv'd the falling stone;</l>
<l n="5.713">From his numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins</l>
<l n="5.714">Dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains:</l>
<l n="5.715">Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;</l>
<l n="5.716">He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:</l>
<l n="5.717">Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there</l>
<l n="5.718">The head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,</l>
<l n="5.719">Till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet:</l>
<l n="5.720">The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,</l>
<l n="5.721">And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="5.722">Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,</l>

<l n="5.724">He fires his host with animating cries,</l>

<l n="5.758">His massy spear, with matchless fury sent,</l>

<l n="5.763">The chief, to perish at his people's head.</l>
<l n="5.764">Shook with his fall, his brazen armour rung,</l>
<l n="5.765">And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;</l>
<l n="5.766">Around his head an iron tempest rain'd;</l>
<l n="5.767">A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd;</l>
<l n="5.768">Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd,</l>
<l n="5.769">And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:</l>
<l n="5.770">He could no more; the showering darts denied</l>

<note n="108.14">14 The allegory of this whole book lies so open, is carried on with such closeness, and wound up with so much fulness and strength, that it is a wonder how it could enter into the imagination of any that these actions of Diomed were only a daring and extravagant fiction in Homer, as if he affected the marvellous at any rate. The great moral of it is, that a brave man should not contend against Heaven, but resist only Venus and Mars, incontinence and ungoverned fury. Diomed is proposed as an example of a great and enterprising nature, which would perpetually be venturing too far, and committing extravagancies or impieties, did it not suffer itself to be checked and guided by Minerva, or Prudence: for it is this Wisdom (as we are told in the very first lines of the book) that raises a hero above all others.

<title type="sub">THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.</title>
</ab>
<p>The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the know­ ledge of the friendship and hospitality past between their ancestors, they make exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus, prevailed upon Paris to return to the battle, and taken a tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.</p>
<p>The scene is first in the field of battle, between the river Simoïs and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.</p>
<lg>
<l n="6.1">Now heaven forsakes the fight; th' immortals yield</l>
<l n="6.2">To human force and human skill the field:</l>
<l n="6.3">Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;</l>
<l n="6.4">Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;</l>
<l n="6.5">While Troy's fam'd streams,<ref n="109.1">1</ref> that bound the deathful plain,</l>
<l n="6.6">On either side run purple to the main.</l>

<l n="6.12">Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest:</l>

<l n="6.53">Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:</l>

<l n="6.55">The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd</l>

<note n="110.3">3 Menelaus.</note>
<note n="110.4">4 This passage, where Agamemnon takes away that Trojan's life whom Menelaus had pardoned, and is not blamed by Homer for so doing, must be ascribed to the uncivilised manners of those times. The historical books of the Old Testament abound in instances of the like cruelty to conquered enemies. Pope.</note>

<l n="6.554">'That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,</l>
<l n="6.555">'And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.</l>
<l n="6.556">'Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,</l>
<l n="6.557">'Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.</l>
<l n="6.558">'Let others in the field their arms employ,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.560">The chief replied: 'That post shall be my care,</l>
<l n="6.561">'Nor that alone, but all the works of war.</l>
<l n="6.562">'How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,</l>
<l n="6.563">'And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground,</l>
<l n="6.564">'Attaint the lustre of my former name,</l>
<l n="6.565">'Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?</l>
<l n="6.566">'My early youth was bred to martial pains,</l>
<l n="6.567">'My soul impels me to th' embattled plains:</l>
<l n="6.568">'Let me be foremost to defend the throne,</l>
<l n="6.569">'And guard my father's glories, and my own.</l>
<l n="6.570">'Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates;</l>
<l n="6.571">'(How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)</l>
<l n="6.572">'The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,</l>
<l n="6.573">'And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.</l>
<l n="6.574">'And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,</l>
<l n="6.575">'My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,</l>
<l n="6.576">'Not Priam's hoary hairs defil'd with gore,</l>
<l n="6.577">'Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;</l>
<l n="6.578">'As thine, Andromache! thy griefs I dread;</l>
<l n="6.579">'I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!</l>
<l n="6.580">'In Argive looms our battles to design,</l>
<l n="6.581">'And woes of which so large a part was thine!</l>
<l n="6.582">'To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring</l>
<l n="6.583">'The weight of waters from Hyperia's<ref n="122.13">13</ref> spring.</l>
<l n="6.584">'There, while you groan beneath the load of life,</l>
<l n="6.585">'They cry, 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'</l>
<l n="6.586">'Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,</l>
<l n="6.587">'Embitters all thy woes by naming me.</l>
<l n="6.588">'The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,</l>
<l n="6.589">'A thousand griefs, shall waken at the name!</l>
<l n="6.590">'May I lie cold before that dreadful day,</l>

<l n="6.592">'Thy Hector, wrapp'd in everlasting sleep,</l>
<l n="6.593">'Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.594">Thus having spoke, th' illustrious chief of Troy</l>
<l n="6.595">Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.</l>
</lg>
<note n="122.13">13 A fountain in Messenia.</note>
<pb n="123"/>
<lg>
<l n="6.596">The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,</l>
<l n="6.597">Scar'd at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.</l>
<l n="6.598">With secret pleasure each fond parent smil'd,</l>
<l n="6.599">And Hector hasted to relieve his child;</l>
<l n="6.600">The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,</l>
<l n="6.601">And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.</l>
<l n="6.602">Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,</l>
<l n="6.603">Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.604">'O thou! whose glory fills th' ethereal throne,</l>
<l n="6.605">'And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!</l>
<l n="6.606">'Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,</l>
<l n="6.607">'To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,</l>
<l n="6.608">'Against his country's foes the war to wage,</l>
<l n="6.609">'And rise the Hector of the future age!</l>
<l n="6.610">'So when, triumphant from successful toils,</l>
<l n="6.611">'Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,</l>
<l n="6.612">'Whole hosts may hail him with deserv'd acclaim,</l>
<l n="6.613">'And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame:'</l>
<l n="6.614">'While pleas'd, amidst the general shouts of Troy,</l>
<l n="6.615">'His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.616">He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms</l>
<l n="6.617">Restor'd the pleasing burden to her arms;</l>
<l n="6.618">Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,</l>
<l n="6.619">Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.</l>
<l n="6.620">The troubled pleasure soon chastis'd by fear,</l>
<l n="6.621">She mingled with the smile a tender tear.</l>
<l n="6.622">The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,</l>
<l n="6.623">And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.624">'Andromache! my soul's far better part,</l>
<l n="6.625">'Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?</l>
<l n="6.626">'No hostile hand can antedate my doom,</l>
<l n="6.627">'Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.</l>
<l n="6.628">'Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth,</l>
<l n="6.629">'And such the hard condition of our birth.</l>
<l n="6.630">'No force can then resist, no flight can save;</l>
<l n="6.631">'All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.</l>
<l n="6.632">'No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,</l>
<l n="6.633">'There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:</l>
<l n="6.634">'Me glory summons to the martial scene,</l>
<l n="6.635">'The field of combat is the sphere for men.</l>
<l n="6.636">'Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,</l>
<l n="6.637">'The first in danger as the first in fame.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.638">Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes</l>
<l n="6.639">His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.</l>
<l n="6.640">His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,</l>
<l n="6.641">Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye,</l>
</lg>
<pb n="124"/>
<lg>
<l n="6.642">That stream'd at every look: then, moving slow,</l>
<l n="6.643">Sought her own palace, and indulg'd her woe.</l>
<l n="6.644">There, while her tears deplor'd the godlike man,</l>
<l n="6.645">Through all her train the soft infection ran;</l>
<l n="6.646">The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,</l>
<l n="6.647">And mourn the living Hector as the dead.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.648">But now, no longer deaf to honour's call,</l>
<l n="6.649">Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.</l>
<l n="6.650">In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,</l>
<l n="6.651">Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.</l>
<l n="6.652">The wanton courser thus, with reins unbound,</l>
<l n="6.653">Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;</l>
<l n="6.654">Pamper'd and proud he seeks the wonted tides,</l>
<l n="6.655">And laves, in height of blood, his shining sides:</l>
<l n="6.656">His head now freed he tosses to the skies;</l>
<l n="6.657">His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies;</l>
<l n="6.658">He snuffs the females in the distant plain,</l>
<l n="6.659">And springs, exulting, to his fields again.</l>
<l n="6.660">With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,</l>
<l n="6.661">In arms refulgent as the god of day,</l>
<l n="6.662">The son of Priam, glorying in his might,</l>
<l n="6.663">Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="6.664">And now the warriors passing on the way,</l>
<l n="6.665">The graceful Paris first excus'd his stay.</l>
<l n="6.666">To whom the noble Hector thus replied:</l>
<l n="6.667">'O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!</l>
<l n="6.668">'Thy power in war with justice none contest;</l>
<l n="6.669">'Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd.</l>
<l n="6.670">'What pity, sloth should seize a soul so brave,</l>
<l n="6.671">'Or godlike Paris live a woman's slave!</l>
<l n="6.672">'My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,</l>
<l n="6.673">'And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.</l>
<l n="6.674">'Haste then, in all their glorious labours share;</l>
<l n="6.675">'For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.</l>
<l n="6.676">'These ills shall cease, whene'er by Jove's decree</l>
<l n="6.677">'We crown the bowl to Heaven and Liberty:</l>

<title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.</title>
</ab>
<p>The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Mi­ nerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scæan gate. They agree to put off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is cast, and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor pro­ poses the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not con­ sent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the funerals are per­ formed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting, but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath.</p>
<p>The three-and-twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax; the next day the truce is agreed: another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain; and one more in building the fortification before the ships; so that somewhat above three days is employed in this book. The scene lies wholly in the field.</p>
<lg>
<l n="7.1">So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,</l>
<l n="7.2">Then rush'd impetuous through the Scæan gate.</l>
<l n="7.3">Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;</l>
<l n="7.4">Both breathing slaughter, both resolv'd in arms.</l>
<l n="7.5">As when to sailors labouring through the main,</l>
<l n="7.6">That long had heav'd the weary oar in vain,</l>
<l n="7.7">Jove bids at length th' expected gales arise;</l>
<l n="7.8">The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies:</l>
<l n="7.9">So welcome these to Troy's desiring train:</l>
<l n="7.10">The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.11">Bold Paris first the work of death begun</l>
<l n="7.12">On great Menestheus, Areïthous' son;</l>
<l n="7.13">Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,</l>
<l n="7.14">The pleasing Arnè was his native place.</l>
<l n="7.15">Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below;</l>
<l n="7.16">Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow</l>
<l n="7.17">Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;</l>
<l n="7.18">And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="126"/>
<lg>
<l n="7.19">By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,</l>
<l n="7.20">Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</l>
<l n="7.21">Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound</l>
<l n="7.22">Drop the cold useless members on the ground.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.23">When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,</l>
<l n="7.24">From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain</l>
<l n="7.25">Fierce she descends: Apollo mark'd her flight,</l>
<l n="7.26">Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height:</l>
<l n="7.27">Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;</l>
<l n="7.28">When thus Apollo to the blue-ey'd maid:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.29">'What cause, O daughter of almighty Jove!</l>
<l n="7.30">'Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?</l>
<l n="7.31">'Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,</l>
<l n="7.32">'To give to Greece the long-divided day?</l>
<l n="7.33">'Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,</l>
<l n="7.34">'Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate:</l>
<l n="7.35">'This day the business of the field suspend;</l>
<l n="7.36">'War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;</l>
<l n="7.37">'Since vengeful goddesses confederate join</l>
<l n="7.38">'To raze her walls, though built by hands divine.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.39">To whom the progeny of Jove replies:</l>
<l n="7.40">'I left for this the council of the skies:</l>
<l n="7.41">'But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,</l>
<l n="7.42">'What art shall calm the furious sons of war?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.43">To her the god: 'Great Hector's soul incite</l>
<l n="7.44">'To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,</l>
<l n="7.45">'Till Greece, provok'd, from all her numbers shew</l>
<l n="7.46">'A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.47">At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;</l>
<l n="7.48">Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew:</l>
<l n="7.49">Hector inspir'd he sought: to him address'd,</l>
<l n="7.50">Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:</l>
<l n="7.51">'O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear</l>
<l n="7.52">'Receive my words; thy friend and brother hear!</l>
<l n="7.53">'Go forth persuasive, and awhile engage</l>
<l n="7.54">'The warring nations to suspend their rage;</l>
<l n="7.55">'Then dare the boldest of the hostile train</l>
<l n="7.56">'To mortal combat on the listed plain,</l>
<l n="7.57">'For not this day shall end thy glorious date;</l>
<l n="7.58">'The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.59">He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;</l>
<l n="7.60">Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,</l>
<l n="7.61">Held by the midst athwart. On either hand</l>
<l n="7.62">The squadrons part; th' expecting Trojans stand.</l>
<l n="7.63">Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear;</l>
<l n="7.64">They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="127"/>

<lg>
<l n="7.65">Th' Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,</l>
<l n="7.66">With silent joy the settling hosts survey:</l>
<l n="7.67">In form of vultures, on the beech's height</l>
<l n="7.68">They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.69">The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,</l>
<l n="7.70">Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.</l>
<l n="7.71">As when a general darkness veils the main,</l>
<l n="7.72">(Soft Zephyr curling the wide watery plain,)</l>
<l n="7.73">The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,</l>
<l n="7.74">And a still horror saddens all the deeps:</l>
<l n="7.75">Thus in thick orders settling wide around,</l>
<l n="7.76">At length compos'd they sit, and shade the ground.</l>
<l n="7.77">Great Hector first amidst both armies broke</l>
<l n="7.78">The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.79">'Hear all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</l>
<l n="7.80">'What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.</l>
<l n="7.81">'Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,</l>
<l n="7.82">'O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;</l>
<l n="7.83">'War with a fiercer tide once more returns,</l>
<l n="7.84">'Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.</l>
<l n="7.85">'You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;</l>
<l n="7.86">''Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:</l>
<l n="7.87">'From all your troops select the boldest knight,</l>
<l n="7.88">'And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.</l>
<l n="7.89">'Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,</l>
<l n="7.90">'Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;</l>
<l n="7.91">'But let my body, to my friends return'd,</l>
<l n="7.92">'By Trojan hands, and Trojan flames be burn'd.</l>
<l n="7.93">'And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,</l>
<l n="7.94">'Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;</l>
<l n="7.95">'If mine the glory to despoil the foe;</l>
<l n="7.96">'On Phœbus' temple I'll his arms bestow;</l>
<l n="7.97">'The breathless carcass to your navy sent,</l>
<l n="7.98">'Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;</l>
<l n="7.99">'Which when some future mariner surveys,</l>
<l n="7.100">'Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,</l>
<l n="7.101">'Thus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,</l>
<l n="7.102">'By Hector slain, the mighty man of war.'</l>
<l n="7.103">'The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name,</l>
<l n="7.104">'And distant ages learn the victor's fame.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.105">This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,</l>
<l n="7.106">Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.</l>
<l n="7.107">Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,</l>
<l n="7.108">And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.109">'Women of Greece! Oh scandal of your race,</l>
<l n="7.110">'Whose coward souls your manly forms disgrace,</l>
</lg>
<pb n="128"/>
<lg>
<l n="7.111">'How great the shame, when every age shall know</l>
<l n="7.112">'That not a Grecian met this noble foe!</l>
<l n="7.113">'Go then, resolve to earth from whence ye grew,</l>
<l n="7.114">'A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!</l>
<l n="7.115">'Be what ye seem, unanimated clay!</l>
<l n="7.116">'Myself will dare the danger of the day.</l>
<l n="7.117">''Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,</l>
<l n="7.118">'But in the hands of God is victory.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.119">These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</l>
<l n="7.120">His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd:</l>
<l n="7.121">That day, Atrides! a superior hand</l>
<l n="7.122">Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;</l>
<l n="7.123">But all at once, thy fury to compose,</l>
<l n="7.124">The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose:</l>
<l n="7.125">E'en he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd</l>
<l n="7.126">Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd:</l>
<l n="7.127">'Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,</l>
<l n="7.128">'And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?</l>
<l n="7.129">'Griev'd though thou art, forbear the rash design;</l>
<l n="7.130">'Great Hector's arm is mightier far than thine.</l>
<l n="7.131">'E'en fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,</l>
<l n="7.132">'And trembling met this dreadful son of war.</l>
<l n="7.133">'Sit thou secure amidst thy social band;</l>
<l n="7.134">'Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.</l>
<l n="7.135">'The mightiest warrior of th' Achaian name,</l>
<l n="7.136">'Though bold, and burning with desire of fame,</l>
<l n="7.137">'Content, the doubtful honour might forego,</l>
<l n="7.138">'So great the danger, and so brave the foe.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.139">He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;</l>
<l n="7.140">He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,</l>
<l n="7.141">No longer bent to rush on certain harms:</l>
<l n="7.142">His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.143">He, from whose lips divine persuasion flows,</l>
<l n="7.144">Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose.</l>
<l n="7.145">Thus to the kings he spoke: 'What grief, what shame,</l>
<l n="7.146">'Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name?</l>
<l n="7.147">'How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn</l>
<l n="7.148">'Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn?</l>
<l n="7.149">'What tears shall down thy silver beard be roll'd,</l>
<l n="7.150">'Oh Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!</l>
<l n="7.151">'Once with what joy the generous prince would hear</l>
<l n="7.152">'Of every chief who fought this glorious war,</l>
<l n="7.153">'Participate their fame, and pleas'd inquire</l>
<l n="7.154">'Each name, each action, and each hero's sire?</l>
<l n="7.155">'Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,</l>
<l n="7.156">'And trembling all before one hostile hand;</l>
</lg>
<pb n="129"/>

<lg>
<l n="7.157">'How would he lift his aged arms on high,</l>
<l n="7.158">'Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!</l>
<l n="7.159">'Oh! would to all th' immortal powers above,</l>
<l n="7.160">'Minerva, Phœbus, and almighty Jove!</l>
<l n="7.161">'Years might again roll back, my youth renew,</l>
<l n="7.162">'And give this arm the spring which once it knew:</l>
<l n="7.163">'When, fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,</l>
<l n="7.164">'I led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,</l>
<l n="7.165">'And with th' Arcadian spears my prowess tried,</l>

<l n="7.168">'Proud, Areïthous' dreadful arms to wield;</l>
<l n="7.169">'Great Areïthous, known from shore to shore</l>
<l n="7.170">'By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;</l>
<l n="7.171">'No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,</l>
<l n="7.172">'But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.</l>
<l n="7.173">'Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,</l>
<l n="7.174">'Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,</l>
<l n="7.175">'Deep in a winding way his breast assail'd,</l>
<l n="7.176">'Nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd:</l>
<l n="7.177">'Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before</l>
<l n="7.178">'Had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:</l>
<l n="7.179">'But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,</l>
<l n="7.180">'To Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.</l>
<l n="7.181">'Furious with this, he crush'd our levell'd bands,</l>
<l n="7.182">'And dar'd the trial of the strongest hands;</l>
<l n="7.183">'Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay;</l>
<l n="7.184">'All saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway;</l>
<l n="7.185">'Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,</l>
<l n="7.186">'And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.</l>
<l n="7.187">'I fought the chief; my arms Minerva crown'd:</l>
<l n="7.188">'Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.</l>
<l n="7.189">'What then he was, oh were your Nestor now!</l>
<l n="7.190">'Not Hector's self should want an equal foe.</l>
<l n="7.191">'But, warriors, you, that youthful vigour boast,</l>
<l n="7.192">'The flower of Greece, th' examples of our host,</l>
<l n="7.193">'Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,</l>
<l n="7.194">'Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.195">His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;</l>
<l n="7.196">And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,</l>
<l n="7.197">Upstarted fierce: but far before the rest</l>
<l n="7.198">The king of men advanc'd his dauntless breast;</l>
<l n="7.199">Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;</l>
<l n="7.200">And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd.</l>
<l n="7.201">Oïleus follow'd: Idomen was there,</l>
<l n="7.202">And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:</l>
</lg>
<pb n="130"/>
<lg>
<l n="7.203">With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,</l>
<l n="7.204">And wise Ulysses clos'd the daring band.</l>
<l n="7.205">All these, alike inspir'd with noble rage,</l>
<l n="7.206">Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.207">'Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,</l>
<l n="7.208">'What chief shall combat, let the lots decide.</l>
<l n="7.209">'Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise</l>
<l n="7.210">'His country's fame, his own immortal praise.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.211">The lots produc'd, each hero signs his own;</l>
<l n="7.212">Then in the general's helm the fates are thrown.</l>
<l n="7.213">The people pray with lifted eyes and hands,</l>
<l n="7.214">And vows like these ascend from all the bands:</l>
<l n="7.215">'Grant thou, Almighty! in whose hand is fate,</l>
<l n="7.216">'A worthy champion for the Grecian state.</l>
<l n="7.217">'This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,</l>
<l n="7.218">'Or he, the king of kings, belov'd by Jove.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.219">Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspir'd,</l>
<l n="7.220">Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desir'd.</l>
<l n="7.221">This from the right to left the herald bears,</l>
<l n="7.222">Held out in order to the Grecian peers;</l>
<l n="7.223">Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,</l>
<l n="7.224">Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;</l>
<l n="7.225">Surveys th' inscription with rejoicing eyes,</l>
<l n="7.226">Then casts before him, and with transport cries:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.227">'Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;</l>
<l n="7.228">'Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.</l>
<l n="7.229">'Now, while my brightest arms my limbs invest,</l>
<l n="7.230">'To Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:</l>
<l n="7.231">'But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,</l>
<l n="7.232">'And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.</l>
<l n="7.233">'Said I in secret? No, your vows declare,</l>
<l n="7.234">'In such a voice as fills the earth and air.</l>
<l n="7.235">'Lives there a chief, whom Ajax ought to dread,</l>
<l n="7.236">'Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred?</l>
<l n="7.237">'From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,</l>
<l n="7.238">'And, born to combats, fear no force of earth.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.239">He said. The troops with elevated eyes,</l>
<l n="7.240">Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:</l>
<l n="7.241">'O father of mankind, superior lord!</l>
<l n="7.242">'On lofty Ida's holy hill ador'd;</l>
<l n="7.243">'Who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,</l>
<l n="7.244">'Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone:</l>
<l n="7.245">'Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away</l>
<l n="7.246">'The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;</l>
<l n="7.247">'Or if illustrious Hector be thy care,</l>
<l n="7.248">'That both may claim it, and that both may share.'</l>
</lg>
<pb n="131"/>

<lg>
<l n="7.249">Now Ajax brac'd his dazzling armour on;</l>
<l n="7.250">Sheath'd in bright steel the giant warrior shone:</l>
<l n="7.251">He moves to combat with majestic pace;</l>
<l n="7.252">So stalks in arms the grizly god of Thrace,</l>
<l n="7.253">When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,</l>
<l n="7.254">And gives whole nations to the waste of wars.</l>
<l n="7.255">Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;</l>
<l n="7.256">Grimly he smil'd; earth trembled as he strode:</l>
<l n="7.257">His massy javelin quivering in his hand,</l>
<l n="7.258">He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.</l>
<l n="7.259">Through every Argive heart new transport ran;</l>
<l n="7.260">All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man.</l>
<l n="7.261">E'en Hector paus'd; and, with new doubt oppress'd,</l>
<l n="7.262">Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:</l>
<l n="7.263">'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;</l>
<l n="7.264">Himself had challeng'd, and the foe drew near.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.265">Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,</l>
<l n="7.266">As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.</l>
<l n="7.267">Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast</l>
<l n="7.268">Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last.</l>
<l n="7.269">(The work of Tychius, who in Hylé dwell'd,</l>
<l n="7.270">And all in arts of armoury excell'd.)</l>
<l n="7.271">This Ajax bore before his manly breast,</l>
<l n="7.272">And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.273">'Hector! approach my arm, and singly know</l>
<l n="7.274">'What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.</l>
<l n="7.275">'Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are</l>
<l n="7.276">'Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:</l>
<l n="7.277">'Let him, inactive on the sea-beat shore,</l>
<l n="7.278">'Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;</l>
<l n="7.279">'Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,</l>
<l n="7.280">'And sends thee one, a sample of her host.</l>
<l n="7.281">'Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;</l>
<l n="7.282">'No more--be sudden, and begin the fight.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.283">'O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!'</l>
<l n="7.284">(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied,)</l>
<l n="7.285">'Me, as a boy or woman, would'st thou fright,</l>
<l n="7.286">'New to the field, and trembling at the fight?</l>
<l n="7.287">'Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,</l>
<l n="7.288">'To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:</l>
<l n="7.289">'I know to shift my ground, remount the car,</l>
<l n="7.290">'Turn, charge, and answer every call of war:</l>
<l n="7.291">'To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,</l>
<l n="7.292">'And bear thick battle on my sounding shield.</l>
<l n="7.293">'But open be our fight, and bold each blow;</l>
<l n="7.294">'I steal no conquest from a noble foe.'</l>
</lg>
<pb n="132"/>
<lg>
<l n="7.295">He said, and, rising high above the field,</l>
<l n="7.296">Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.</l>
<l n="7.297">Full on the brass descending from above</l>
<l n="7.298">Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,</l>
<l n="7.299">Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;</l>
<l n="7.300">Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew;</l>
<l n="7.301">His corslet enters, and his garment rends,</l>
<l n="7.302">And, glancing downwards, near his flank descends.</l>
<l n="7.303">The wary Trojan shrinks, and, bending low</l>
<l n="7.304">Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.</l>
<l n="7.305">From their bor'd shields the chiefs their javelins drew,</l>
<l n="7.306">Then close impetuous, and the charge renew:</l>
<l n="7.307">Fierce as the mountain lions bath'd in blood,</l>
<l n="7.308">Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.</l>
<l n="7.309">At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;</l>
<l n="7.310">The blunted point against the buckler bends.</l>
<l n="7.311">But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,</l>
<l n="7.312">Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;</l>
<l n="7.313">It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd;</l>
<l n="7.314">Spouts the black gore, and dims the shining shield.</l>
<l n="7.315">Yet ceas'd not Hector thus; but, stooping down,</l>
<l n="7.316">In his strong hand upheav'd a flinty stone,</l>
<l n="7.317">Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;</l>
<l n="7.318">Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;</l>
<l n="7.319">The hollow brass resounded with the shock.</l>
<l n="7.320">Then Ajax seiz'd the fragment of a rock,</l>
<l n="7.321">Applied each nerve, and, swinging round on high,</l>
<l n="7.322">With force tempestuous let the ruin fly:</l>
<l n="7.323">The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke;</l>
<l n="7.324">His slacken'd knees receiv'd the numbing stroke;</l>
<l n="7.325">Great Hector falls extended on the field,</l>
<l n="7.326">His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:</l>
<l n="7.327">Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might</l>
<l n="7.328">Confirm'd his sinews, and restor'd to fight.</l>
<l n="7.329">And now both heroes their broad faulchions drew;</l>
<l n="7.330">In flaming circles round their heads they flew;</l>
<l n="7.331">But then by heralds' voice the word was given,</l>
<l n="7.332">The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:</l>
<l n="7.333">Divine Talthybius whom the Greeks employ,</l>
<l n="7.334">And sage Idæus on the part of Troy,</l>
<l n="7.335">Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;</l>
<l n="7.336">And first Idæus' awful voice was heard:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.337">'Forbear, my sons! your farther force to prove,</l>
<l n="7.338">'Both dear to men, and both belov'd of Jove.</l>
<l n="7.339">'To either host your matchless worth is known,</l>
<l n="7.340">'Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="133"/>

<lg>
<l n="7.341">'But now the night extends her awful shade;</l>
<l n="7.342">'The goddess parts you: be the night obey'd.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.343">To whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:</l>
<l n="7.344">'O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.</l>
<l n="7.345">'Let him, who first provok'd our chiefs to fight,</l>
<l n="7.346">'Let him demand the sanction of the night;</l>
<l n="7.347">'If first he ask it, I content obey,</l>
<l n="7.348">'And cease the strife when Hector shews the way.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.349">'O first of Greeks!' (his noble foe rejoin'd,)</l>
<l n="7.350">'Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,</l>
<l n="7.351">'With strength of body, and with worth of mind!</l>
<l n="7.352">'Now martial law commands us to forbear;</l>
<l n="7.353">'Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war;</l>
<l n="7.354">'Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,</l>
<l n="7.355">'And let the gods decide of death or life!</l>
<l n="7.356">'Since then the night extends her gloomy shade,</l>
<l n="7.357">'And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.</l>
<l n="7.358">'Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,</l>
<l n="7.359">'And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;</l>
<l n="7.360">'As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,</l>
<l n="7.361">'Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.</l>
<l n="7.362">'But let us, on this memorable day,</l>
<l n="7.363">'Exchange some gift; that Greece and Troy may say,</l>
<l n="7.364">'"Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;</l>
<l n="7.365">'"And each brave foe was in his soul a friend."'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.366">With that, a sword with stars of silver grac'd,</l>
<l n="7.367">The baldrick studded, and the sheath enchas'd,</l>
<l n="7.368">He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd</l>
<l n="7.369">A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.</l>
<l n="7.370">Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;</l>
<l n="7.371">This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.372">The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,</l>
<l n="7.373">And hail with joy the champion of their state:</l>
<l n="7.374">Escap'd great Ajax, they survey'd him round,</l>
<l n="7.375">Alive, unharm'd, and vigorous from his wound.</l>
<l n="7.376">To Troy's high gates the godlike man they bear,</l>
<l n="7.377">Their present triumph, as their late despair.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.378">But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,</l>
<l n="7.379">The well-arm'd Greeks to Agamemnon lead.</l>
<l n="7.380">A steer for sacrifice the king design'd,</l>
<l n="7.381">Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.</l>
<l n="7.382">The victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,</l>
<l n="7.383">The beast they quarter, and the joints divide;</l>
<l n="7.384">Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</l>
<l n="7.385">Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</l>
<l n="7.386">The king himself (an honorary sign)</l>
<l n="7.387">Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="134"/>
<lg>
<l n="7.388">When now the rage of hunger was remov'd,</l>
<l n="7.389">Nestor, in each persuasive art approv'd,</l>
<l n="7.390">The sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,</l>
<l n="7.391">In words like these his prudent thought express'd:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.392">'How dear, O king! this fatal day has cost!</l>
<l n="7.393">'What Greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!</l>
<l n="7.394">'What tides of blood have drench'd Scamander's shore!</l>
<l n="7.395">'What crowds of heroes sunk, to rise no more!</l>
<l n="7.396">'Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light</l>
<l n="7.397">'Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:</l>
<l n="7.398">'Some space at least permit the war to breathe,</l>
<l n="7.399">'While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,</l>
<l n="7.400">'From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,</l>
<l n="7.401">'And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear:</l>
<l n="7.402">'So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,</l>
<l n="7.403">'And pious children o'er their ashes weep.</l>
<l n="7.404">'Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blaz'd,</l>
<l n="7.405">'High o'er them all a general tomb be rais'd;</l>
<l n="7.406">'Next, to secure our camp, and naval powers,</l>
<l n="7.407">'Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;</l>
<l n="7.408">'From space to space be ample gates around,</l>
<l n="7.409">'For passing chariots, and a trench profound.</l>
<l n="7.410">'So Greece to combat shall in safety go,</l>
<l n="7.411">'Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe.'</l>
<l n="7.412">'Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel mov'd;</l>
<l n="7.413">The sceptred kings of Greece his words approv'd.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.414">Meanwhile, conven'd at Priam's palace gate,</l>
<l n="7.415">The Trojan peers in nightly council sat:</l>
<l n="7.416">A senate void of order, as of choice,</l>
<l n="7.417">Their hearts were fearful, and confus'd their voice.</l>
<l n="7.418">Antenor rising, thus demands their ear:</l>
<l n="7.419">'Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!</l>
<l n="7.420">''Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,</l>
<l n="7.421">'And I but move what every god requires:</l>
<l n="7.422">'Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restor'd,</l>
<l n="7.423">'And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.</l>
<l n="7.424">'The ties of faith, the sworn alliance broke,</l>
<l n="7.425">'Our impious battles the just gods provoke.</l>
<l n="7.426">'As this advice ye practise, or reject,</l>
<l n="7.427">'So hope success, or dread the dire effect.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.428">The senior spoke, and sat. To whom replied</l>
<l n="7.429">The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:</l>
<l n="7.430">'Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years,</l>
<l n="7.431">'But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears:</l>
<l n="7.432">'Old man, if void of fallacy or art</l>
<l n="7.433">'Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,</l>
</lg>
<pb n="135"/>

<lg>
<l n="7.434">'Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;</l>
<l n="7.435">'But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.</l>
<l n="7.436">'Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!</l>
<l n="7.437">'Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame;</l>
<l n="7.438">'My treasures, too, for peace I will resign;</l>
<l n="7.439">'But be this bright possession ever mine.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.440">'Twas then, the growing discord to compose,</l>
<l n="7.441">Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:</l>
<l n="7.442">His godlike aspect deep attention drew:</l>
<l n="7.443">He paus'd, and these pacific words ensue:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.444">'Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!</l>
<l n="7.445">'Now take refreshment as the hour demands;</l>
<l n="7.446">'Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night,</l>
<l n="7.447">'Till the new sun restores the cheerful light:</l>
<l n="7.448">'Then shall our herald, to th' Atrides sent,</l>
<l n="7.449">'Before their ships proclaim my son's intent.</l>
<l n="7.450">'Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn</l>
<l n="7.451">'Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn;</l>
<l n="7.452">'That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</l>
<l n="7.453">'And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.454">The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch'd with haste</l>
<l n="7.455">(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.</l>
<l n="7.456">Soon as the rosy morn had wak'd the day,</l>
<l n="7.457">To the black ships Idæus bent his way;</l>
<l n="7.458">There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,</l>
<l n="7.459">He rais'd his voice: the hosts stood listening round:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.460">'Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!</l>
<l n="7.461">'The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear.</l>
<l n="7.462">'Pleas'd may ye hear (so heav'n succeed my prayers!)</l>
<l n="7.463">'What Paris, author of the war, declares.</l>
<l n="7.464">'The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore</l>
<l n="7.465">'(O had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!)</l>
<l n="7.466">'He proffers injur'd Greece; with large increase</l>
<l n="7.467">'Of added Trojan wealth, to buy the peace.</l>
<l n="7.468">'But, to restore the beauteous bride again,</l>
<l n="7.469">'This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.</l>
<l n="7.470">'Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn</l>
<l n="7.471">'Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.</l>
<l n="7.472">'That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</l>
<l n="7.473">'And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.474">The Greeks give ear, but none the silence broke;</l>
<l n="7.475">At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:</l>
<l n="7.476">'O take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,</l>
<l n="7.477">'Their proffer'd wealth, nor e'en the Spartan dame.</l>
<l n="7.478">'Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,</l>
<l n="7.479">'And Troy already totters to her fall.'</l>
</lg>
<pb n="136"/>
<lg>
<l n="7.480">Th' admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,</l>
<l n="7.481">With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.</l>
<l n="7.482">Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:</l>
<l n="7.483">'Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece.</l>
<l n="7.484">'For what remains, let funeral flames be fed</l>
<l n="7.485">'With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead:</l>
<l n="7.486">'Go, search your slaughter'd chiefs on yonder plain,</l>
<l n="7.487">'And gratify the manes of the slain.</l>
<l n="7.488">'Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!'</l>
<l n="7.489">He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.490">To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay</l>
<l n="7.491">To wait th' event, the herald bent his way.</l>
<l n="7.492">He came, and, standing in the midst, explain'd</l>
<l n="7.493">The peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.</l>
<l n="7.494">Straight to their several cares the Trojans move;</l>
<l n="7.495">Some search the plain, some fell the sounding grove:</l>
<l n="7.496">Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,</l>
<l n="7.497">Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.</l>
<l n="7.498">And now from forth the chambers of the main,</l>
<l n="7.499">To shed his sacred light on earth again,</l>
<l n="7.500">Arose the golden chariot of the day,</l>
<l n="7.501">And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.</l>
<l n="7.502">In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train</l>
<l n="7.503">Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.</l>
<l n="7.504">Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,</l>
<l n="7.505">With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.</l>
<l n="7.506">The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,</l>
<l n="7.507">And, laid along their cars, deplor'd the dead.</l>
<l n="7.508">Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste</l>
<l n="7.509">The bodies decent on the piles were plac'd:</l>
<l n="7.510">With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd;</l>
<l n="7.511">And sadly slow to sacred Troy return'd.</l>
<l n="7.512">Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,</l>
<l n="7.513">And decent on the pile dispose the dead;</l>
<l n="7.514">The cold remains consume with equal care;</l>
<l n="7.515">And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.</l>
<l n="7.516">Now, ere the morn had streak'd with redd'ning light</l>
<l n="7.517">The doubtful confines of the day and night;</l>
<l n="7.518">About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,</l>
<l n="7.519">And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.</l>
<l n="7.520">Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,</l>
<l n="7.521">They rais'd embattl'd walls with lofty towers:</l>
<l n="7.522">From space to space were ample gates around,</l>
<l n="7.523">For passing chariots; and a trench profound,</l>
<l n="7.524">Of large extent: and deep in earth below</l>
<l n="7.525">Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.</l>
</lg>

<l n="7.526">So toil'd the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,</l>

<l n="7.528">Amaz'd beheld the wondrous works of man:</l>
<l n="7.529">Then he whose trident shakes the earth began:</l>

<l n="7.541">Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="7.542">Th' almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,</l>

<l n="7.548">'Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,</l>

<title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>

<ab>
<title type="sub">THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.</title>
</ab>
<p>Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the pains of Tartarus, if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels. The armies join battle; Jupiter on mount Ida weighs in his balances the fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger; Diomed relieves him; whose ex­ ploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the battle. Hector continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to their fortifications be­ fore the ships,) and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy from reimbarking and escaping by flight. They kindle fires through all the field, and pass the night under arms.</p>
<p>The time of seven-and-twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial machines) lies in the field toward the sea-shore.</p>
<lg>
<l n="8.1">AURORA now, fair daughter of the dawn,</l>
<l n="8.2">Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn:</l>
<l n="8.3">When Jove conven'd the senate of the skies,</l>
<l n="8.4">Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise.</l>
<l n="8.5">The sire of gods his awful silence broke;</l>
<l n="8.6">The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.7">'Celestial states, immortal gods! give ear,</l>
<l n="8.8">Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;</l>
</lg>
<pb n="139"/>

<lg>
<l n="8.9">'The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;</l>
<l n="8.10">'Thou, Fate! fulfil it! and ye, powers! approve!</l>
<l n="8.11">'What god but enters yon forbidden field,</l>
<l n="8.12">'Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield;</l>
<l n="8.13">'Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,</l>
<l n="8.14">'Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven:</l>
<l n="8.15">'Or far, oh far from steep Olympus thrown,</l>
<l n="8.16">'Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,</l>
<l n="8.17">'With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,</l>
<l n="8.18">'And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;</l>
<l n="8.19">'As deep beneath th' infernal centre hurl'd,</l>
<l n="8.20">'As from that centre to th' ethereal world.</l>
<l n="8.21">'Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes;</l>
<l n="8.22">'And know, th' Almighty is the god of gods.</l>
<l n="8.23">'League all your forces then, ye powers above,</l>
<l n="8.24">'Join all, and try th' omnipotence of Jove:</l>
<l n="8.25">'Let down our golden everlasting chain,</l>
<l n="8.26">'Whose strong embrace holds heaven and earth and main:</l>
<l n="8.27">'Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,</l>
<l n="8.28">'To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth:</l>
<l n="8.29">'Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,</l>
<l n="8.30">'I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;</l>
<l n="8.31">'I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,</l>
<l n="8.32">'And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!</l>
<l n="8.33">'For such I reign, unbounded and above;</l>
<l n="8.34">'And such are men and gods, compar'd to Jove.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.35">Th' Almighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply;</l>
<l n="8.36">A reverent horror silenced all the sky;</l>
<l n="8.37">Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look;</l>
<l n="8.38">At length his best belov'd, the power of wisdom, spoke:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.39">'Oh first and greatest! God, by gods ador'd!</l>
<l n="8.40">'We own thy might, our father and our lord!</l>
<l n="8.41">'But ah! permit to pity human state:</l>
<l n="8.42">'If not to help, at least lament their fate.</l>
<l n="8.43">'From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,</l>
<l n="8.44">'With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;</l>
<l n="8.45">'Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,</l>
<l n="8.46">'Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.47">The cloud-compelling god her suit approv'd,</l>
<l n="8.48">And smiled superior on his best-belov'd.</l>
<l n="8.49">Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took;</l>
<l n="8.50">The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:</l>
<l n="8.51">Rapt by th' ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd;</l>
<l n="8.52">Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold.</l>
<l n="8.53">Of heaven's undrossy gold the god's array,</l>
<l n="8.54">Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="140"/>
<lg>
<l n="8.55">High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly</l>
<l n="8.56">Between th' extended earth and starry sky.</l>
<l n="8.57">But when to Ida's topmost height he came,</l>
<l n="8.58">(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)</l>
<l n="8.59">Where, o'er her pointed summits proudly rais'd,</l>
<l n="8.60">His fane breath'd odours, and his altar blaz'd:</l>
<l n="8.61">There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire</l>
<l n="8.62">Of gods and men releas'd the steeds of fire:</l>
<l n="8.63">Blue ambient mists th' immortal steeds embrac'd;</l>
<l n="8.64">High on the cloudy point his seat he plac'd;</l>
<l n="8.65">Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,</l>
<l n="8.66">The town, and tents, and navigable seas.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.67">Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast,</l>
<l n="8.68">And buckled on their shining arms with haste.</l>
<l n="8.69">Troy rous'd as soon; for on this dreadful day</l>
<l n="8.70">The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.</l>
<l n="8.71">The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;</l>
<l n="8.72">Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:</l>
<l n="8.73">Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground;</l>
<l n="8.74">The tumult thickens, and the skies resound.</l>
<l n="8.75">And now with shouts the shocking armies clos'd,</l>
<l n="8.76">To lances lances, shields to shields oppos'd;</l>
<l n="8.77">Host against host with shadowy legions drew,</l>
<l n="8.78">The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;</l>
<l n="8.79">Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,</l>
<l n="8.80">Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;</l>
<l n="8.81">With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,</l>
<l n="8.82">And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.</l>
<l n="8.83">Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,</l>
<l n="8.84">O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,</l>
<l n="8.85">Commutual death the fate of war confounds,</l>
<l n="8.86">Each adverse battle gor'd with equal wounds.</l>
<l n="8.87">But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,</l>
<l n="8.88">The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,</l>
<l n="8.89">With equal hand; in these explor'd the fate</l>
<l n="8.90">Of Greece and Troy, and pois'd the mighty weight.</l>
<l n="8.91">Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies</l>
<l n="8.92">Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.</l>
<l n="8.93">Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;</l>
<l n="8.94">The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;</l>
<l n="8.95">Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;</l>
<l n="8.96">Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.</l>
<l n="8.97">Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire,</l>
<l n="8.98">The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.</l>
<l n="8.99">Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,</l>
<l n="8.100">Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war;</l>
</lg>
<pb n="141"/>

<lg>
<l n="8.101">Nor he, the king of men, th' alarm sustain'd;</l>
<l n="8.102">Nestor alone amidst the storm remain'd.</l>
<l n="8.103">Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart</l>
<l n="8.104">Had pierc'd his courser in a mortal part;</l>
<l n="8.105">Fix'd in the forehead where the springing mane</l>
<l n="8.106">Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;</l>
<l n="8.107">Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,</l>
<l n="8.108">Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.</l>
<l n="8.109">Scarce had his faulchion cut the reins, and freed</l>
<l n="8.110">Th' incumbent chariot from the dying steed,</l>
<l n="8.111">When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,</l>
<l n="8.112">Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.</l>
<l n="8.113">That day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand</l>
<l n="8.114">The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,</l>
<l n="8.115">But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd</l>
<l n="8.116">He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.117">'Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?</l>
<l n="8.118">'O flight unworthy great Laërtes' son!</l>
<l n="8.119">'Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,</l>
<l n="8.120">'Pierc'd in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?</l>
<l n="8.121">'Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage</l>
<l n="8.122">'The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.123">His fruitless words are lost unheard in air;</l>
<l n="8.124">Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.</l>
<l n="8.125">But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,</l>
<l n="8.126">A single warrior 'midst a host of foes;</l>
<l n="8.127">Before the coursers with a sudden spring</l>
<l n="8.128">He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.129">'Great perils, father! wait th' unequal fight;</l>
<l n="8.130">'These younger champions will oppress thy might.</l>
<l n="8.131">'Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,</l>
<l n="8.132">'Weak is thy servant,<ref n="141.1">1</ref> and thy coursers slow.</l>
<l n="8.133">'Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car</l>
<l n="8.134">'Observe the steeds of Tros, renown'd in war,</l>
<l n="8.135">'Practis'd alike to turn, to stop, to chase,</l>
<l n="8.136">'To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:</l>
<l n="8.137">'These late obey'd Æneas' guiding rein;</l>
<l n="8.138">'Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train:</l>
<l n="8.139">'With these against yon Trojans will we go,</l>

<l n="8.141">'Fierce as he is, e'en he may learn to fear</l>
<l n="8.142">'The thirsty fury of my flying spear.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.143">Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war,</l>
<l n="8.144">Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:</l>
</lg>
<note n="141.1">1 The charioteer.</note>
<pb n="142"/>
<lg>
<l n="8.145">The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;</l>
<l n="8.146">Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold.</l>
<l n="8.147">The reverend charioteer directs the course,</l>
<l n="8.148">And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.</l>
<l n="8.149">Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,</l>
<l n="8.150">Fierce he drove on: Tydides whirl'd his spear.</l>
<l n="8.151">The spear with erring haste mistook its way,</l>
<l n="8.152">But plung'd in Eniopeus' bosom lay.</l>
<l n="8.153">His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;</l>
<l n="8.154">The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.</l>
<l n="8.155">Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill'd,</l>
<l n="8.156">Yet unreveng'd permits to press the field;</l>
<l n="8.157">Till to supply his place and rule the car,</l>
<l n="8.158">Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.</l>
<l n="8.159">And now had death and horror cover'd all;</l>
<l n="8.160">Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall</l>
<l n="8.161">Enclos'd had bled: but Jove with awful sound</l>
<l n="8.162">Roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound:</l>
<l n="8.163">Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew;</l>
<l n="8.164">The ground before him flam'd with sulphur blue:</l>
<l n="8.165">The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;</l>
<l n="8.166">And Nestor's trembling hand confess'd his fright:</l>
<l n="8.167">He dropp'd the reins; and, shook with sacred dread,</l>
<l n="8.168">Thus, turning, warn'd th' intrepid Diomed:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="8.169">'O chief! too daring in thy friend's defence,</l>
<l n="8.170">'Retire advis'd, and urge the chariot hence.</l>
<l n="8.171">'This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies</l>

<l n="8.175">''Tis not in man his fix'd decree to move:</l>

<l n="8.177">'O reverend prince!' (Tydides thus replies)</l>
<l n="8.178">'Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.</l>
<l n="8.179">'But, ah what grief! should haughty Hector boast,</l>
<l n="8.180">'I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.</l>
<l n="8.181">'Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,</l>

<l n="8.524">Then, mounting on the pinions of the wind,</l>

<lg>
<l n="8.534">She spoke, and backward turn'd her steeds of light,</l>
<l n="8.535">Adorn'd with manes of gold, and heavenly bright.</l>
<l n="8.536">The Hours unloos'd them, panting as they stood,</l>

<l n="8.546">'Twas Neptune's charge his coursers to unbrace,</l>

<l n="8.558">'Soon was your battle o'er: proud Troy retir'd</l>
<l n="8.559">'Before your face, and in your wrath expir'd.</l>

<l n="8.561">'Unmatch'd our force, unconquer'd is our hand:</l>

<l n="8.564">'Your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,</l>
<l n="8.565">'And each immortal nerve with horror shake.</l>
<l n="8.566">'For thus I speak, and what I speak shall stand,</l>
<l n="8.567">'What power soe'er provokes our lifted hand,</l>

<l n="8.593">'That stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)</l>

<title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.</title>
</ab>
<p>Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit the siege, and return to their country. Diomede opposes this, and Nestor seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures</p>
<pb n="155"/>

<p>were to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor farther prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are accompanied by old Phœnix. They make, each of them, very moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phœnix in his tent. The ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.</p>
<p>This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.</p>
<lg>
<l n="9.1">THUS joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;</l>
<l n="9.2">While Fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,</l>
<l n="9.3">And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,</l>
<l n="9.4">Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.</l>
<l n="9.5">As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,</l>
<l n="9.6">A double tempest of the west and north</l>
<l n="9.7">Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,</l>
<l n="9.8">Heaps waves on waves, and bids th' Ægean roar;</l>
<l n="9.9">This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd;</l>
<l n="9.10">Such various passions urg'd the troubled host.</l>
<l n="9.11">Great Agamemnon griev'd above the rest;</l>
<l n="9.12">Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;</l>
<l n="9.13">Himself his orders to the heralds bears,</l>
<l n="9.14">To bid to council all the Grecian peers,</l>
<l n="9.15">But bid in whispers:<ref n="155.1">1</ref> these surround their chief,</l>
<l n="9.16">In solemn sadness and majestic grief.</l>
<l n="9.17">The king amidst the mournful circle rose;</l>
<l n="9.18">Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows:</l>
<l n="9.19">So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,</l>
<l n="9.20">In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.</l>
<l n="9.21">With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;</l>
<l n="9.22">Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="9.23">'Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care,<ref n="155.2">2</ref></l>
<l n="9.24">'Fellows in arms, and princes of the war!</l>
<l n="9.25">'Of partial Jove too justly we complain,</l>
<l n="9.26">'And heavenly oracles believ'd in vain.</l>
<l n="9.27">'A safe return was promis'd to our toils,<ref n="155.3">3</ref></l>
<l n="9.28">'With conquest honour'd, and enrich'd with spoils:</l>
<l n="9.29">'Now shameful flight alone can save the host,</l>
<l n="9.30">'Our wealth, our people, and our glory, lost.</l>

<l n="9.50">'The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.</l>
<l n="9.51">'The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,</l>
<l n="9.52">'The gods have made thee but by halves a king:</l>
<l n="9.53">'They gave thee sceptres and a wide command,</l>
<l n="9.54">'They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;</l>
<l n="9.55">'The noblest power that might the world control</l>
<l n="9.56">'They gave thee not-a brave and virtuous soul.<ref n="156.4">4</ref></l>
<l n="9.57">'Is this a general's voice, that would suggest</l>
<l n="9.58">'Fears like his own in every Grecian breast?</l>
<l n="9.59">'Confiding in our want of worth he stands,</l>
<l n="9.60">'And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.</l>
<l n="9.61">'Go thou, inglorious! from th' embattled plain,</l>
<l n="9.62">'Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;</l>
<l n="9.63">'A nobler care the Grecians shall employ,</l>
<l n="9.64">'To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.</l>
<l n="9.65">'Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,</l>
<l n="9.66">'Myself will stay, till Troy or I expire;</l>
<l n="9.67">'Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;</l>
<l n="9.68">'God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came.'</l>
</lg>
<note n="156.4">4 What can be the drift of Diomede, when he insults Agamemnon in his griefs and distresses? The truth is, this whole accusation of Diomede is only a feint to serve the designs of Agamemnon; for being desirous to persuade the Greeks against their departure, he effects that design by this counterfeited anger and licence of speech; and seeming to resent that Agamemnon should be capable of imagining that the army would return to Greece, he artfully makes use of these reproaches to cover his argument.

<title type="sub">THE NIGHT ADVENTURE OF DIOMEDE AND ULYSSES.</title>
</ab>
<p>Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of Aga­ memnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomede, are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemy's camp, to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomede undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his compa­ nion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are inform­ ed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians, who were lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus with several of his officers, and seize the famous</p>
<pb n="175"/>

<p>horses of that prince, with which they return in triumph to the camp.</p>
<p>The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.</p>
<lg>
<l n="10.1">ALL night the chiefs before their vessels lay,</l>
<l n="10.2">And lost in sleep the labours of the day:</l>
<l n="10.3">All but the king; with various thoughts oppress'd,</l>
<l n="10.4">His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.</l>
<l n="10.5">As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power</l>
<l n="10.6">Foretells the rattling hail, or weighty shower,</l>
<l n="10.7">Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,</l>
<l n="10.8">Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;</l>
<l n="10.9">By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,</l>
<l n="10.10">And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:</l>
<l n="10.11">So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,</l>
<l n="10.12">Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.</l>
<l n="10.13">Now, o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys</l>
<l n="10.14">From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;</l>
<l n="10.15">Hears in the passing wind their music blow,</l>
<l n="10.16">And marks distinct the voices of the foe.</l>
<l n="10.17">Now, looking backwards to the fleet and coast,</l>
<l n="10.18">Anxious he sorrows for th' endanger'd host.</l>
<l n="10.19">He rends his hairs, in sacrifice to Jove,<ref n="175.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="10.20">And sues to him that ever lives above:</l>
<l n="10.21">Inly he groans; while glory and despair</l>
<l n="10.22">Divide his heart, and wage a doubtful war.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.23">A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;</l>
<l n="10.24">To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,</l>
<l n="10.25">With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate</l>
<l n="10.26">What yet remains to save th' afflicted state.</l>
<l n="10.27">He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,</l>
<l n="10.28">Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;</l>
<l n="10.29">A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;</l>
<l n="10.30">His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.</l>
<l n="10.31">Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,</l>
<l n="10.32">Alike denied the gift of soft repose,</l>
<l n="10.33">Laments for Greece; that in his cause before</l>
<l n="10.34">So much had suffer'd, and must suffer more.</l>
<l n="10.35">A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread;</l>
<l n="10.36">A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:</l>
<l n="10.37">Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went</l>
<l n="10.38">To wake Atrides in the royal tent.</l>
<l n="10.39">Already wak'd, Atrides he descried</l>
<l n="10.40">His armour buckling at his vessel's side.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="10.41">Joyful they met: the Spartan thus begun:</l>
<l n="10.42">'Why puts my brother this bright armour on?</l>
<l n="10.43">'Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,</l>
<l n="10.44">'To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?</l>
<l n="10.45">'But say, what hero shall sustain the task?</l>
<l n="10.46">'Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask,</l>
<l n="10.47">'Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,</l>
<l n="10.48">'And 'midst a hostile camp explore the foe.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.49">To whom the king: 'In such distress we stand,</l>
<l n="10.50">'No vulgar counsels our affairs demand;</l>
<l n="10.51">'Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,</l>
<l n="10.52">'But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.</l>
<l n="10.53">'For Jove averse our humble prayer denies,</l>

<l n="10.55">'What eye has witness'd, or what ear believ'd,</l>

<l n="10.61">'Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,</l>
<l n="10.62">'And curse the battle where their fathers fell.</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.63">'Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,</l>
<l n="10.64">'There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;</l>
<l n="10.65">'Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;</l>

<l n="10.68">'Whose son, with Merion, o'er the watch presides.')</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.69">To whom the Spartan: 'These thy orders borne,</l>
<l n="10.70">'Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.71">'There shalt thou stay,' (the king of men replied,)</l>
<l n="10.72">'Else may we miss to meet without a guide,</l>
<l n="10.73">'The paths so many, and the camp so wide.</l>
<l n="10.74">'Still, with your voice, the slothful soldiers raise,</l>
<l n="10.75">'Urge by their fathers' fame, their future praise.</l>
<l n="10.76">'Forget we now our state and lofty birth;</l>
<l n="10.77">'Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.</l>
<l n="10.78">'To labour is the lot of man below;</l>
<l n="10.79">'And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.80">This said, each parted to his several cares;</l>
<l n="10.81">The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;</l>
<l n="10.82">The sage protector of the Greeks he found</l>
<l n="10.83">Stretch'd in his bed, with all his arms around;</l>
<l n="10.84">The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,</l>
<l n="10.85">The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;</l>
<l n="10.86">The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,</l>
<l n="10.87">That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.88">Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,</l>
<l n="10.89">The hoary monarch rais'd his eyes, and said:</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.90">'What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,</l>

<l n="10.92">'Seek'st thou some friend, or nightly centinel?</l>
<l n="10.93">'Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.'</l>

<l n="10.105">'And all my people's miseries are mine.</l>
<l n="10.106">'If aught of use thy waking thought suggest,</l>

<l n="10.137">'Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now.</l>
<l n="10.138">'My generous brother is of gentle kind,</l>
<l n="10.139">'He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;</l>
<l n="10.140">'Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,</l>
<l n="10.141">'Content to follow when we lead the way.</l>
<l n="10.142">'But now, our ills industrious to prevent,</l>
<l n="10.143">'Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.</l>
<l n="10.144">'The chiefs you nam'd, already, at his call,</l>
<l n="10.145">'Prepare to meet us at the navy-wall;</l>
<l n="10.146">'Assembling there, between the trench and gates,</l>
<l n="10.147">'Near the night-guards our chosen council waits.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.148">'Then none' (said Nestor) 'shall his rule withstand,</l>
<l n="10.149">'For great examples justify command.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.150">With that, the venerable warrior rose;</l>
<l n="10.151">The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;</l>
<l n="10.152">His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,</l>
<l n="10.153">Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lin'd.</l>
<l n="10.154">Then, rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste</l>
<l n="10.155">His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.</l>
<l n="10.156">The camp he travers'd through the sleeping crowd,</l>
<l n="10.157">Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.</l>
<l n="10.158">Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,</l>
<l n="10.159">Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.160">'What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,</l>
<l n="10.161">'Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.162">'O prudent chief!' (the Pylian chief replied)</l>
<l n="10.163">'Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:</l>
<l n="10.164">'Whatever means of safety can be sought,</l>
<l n="10.165">'Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,</l>
<l n="10.166">'Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;</l>
<l n="10.167">'All, all depend on this important night!'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.168">He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield:</l>
<l n="10.169">Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.</l>
<l n="10.170">Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,</l>
<l n="10.171">All sheath'd in arms, his brave companions round:</l>
<l n="10.172">Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,</l>
<l n="10.173">His head reclining on his bossy shield:</l>
<l n="10.174">A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,</l>
<l n="10.175">Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.</l>
<l n="10.176">A bull's black hide compos'd the hero's bed;</l>
<l n="10.177">A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.</l>
<l n="10.178">Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes</l>
<l n="10.179">The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:</l>
</lg>
<pb n="179"/>

<lg>
<l n="10.180">'Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong</l>
<l n="10.181">'Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.</l>
<l n="10.182">'But sleep'st thou now? when from yon hill the foe</l>
<l n="10.183">'Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.184">At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;</l>
<l n="10.185">The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:</l>
<l n="10.186">'Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,</l>
<l n="10.187">'Though years and honours bid thee seek repose.</l>
<l n="10.188">'Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;</l>
<l n="10.189">'Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.190">'My friend,' (he answer'd,) 'generous is thy care,</l>
<l n="10.191">'These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear,</l>
<l n="10.192">'Their loyal thoughts and pious loves conspire</l>
<l n="10.193">'To ease a sovereign, and relieve a sire.</l>
<l n="10.194">'But now the last despair surrounds our host;</l>
<l n="10.195">'No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;</l>
<l n="10.196">'Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,</l>
<l n="10.197">'Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:</l>
<l n="10.198">'Yet if my years thy kind regard engage,</l>
<l n="10.199">'Employ thy youth as I employ my age;</l>
<l n="10.200">'Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;</l>
<l n="10.201">'He serves me most, who serves his country best.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.202">This said, the hero o'er his shoulder flung</l>
<l n="10.203">A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;</l>
<l n="10.204">Then seiz'd his ponderous lance, and strode along.</l>
<l n="10.205">Meges the bold, with Ajax fam'd for speed,</l>
<l n="10.206">The warrior rous'd, and to th' entrenchments led.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.207">And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;</l>
<l n="10.208">A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepar'd:</l>
<l n="10.209">Th' unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,</l>
<l n="10.210">And, couching close, repel invading sleep.</l>
<l n="10.211">So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,</l>
<l n="10.212">With toil protected from the prowling train;</l>
<l n="10.213">When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,</l>
<l n="10.214">Springs from the mountains tow'rd the guarded fold:</l>
<l n="10.215">Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;</l>
<l n="10.216">Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear</l>
<l n="10.217">Of hounds, and men; they start, they gaze around;</l>
<l n="10.218">Watch every side, and turn to every sound.</l>
<l n="10.219">Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,</l>
<l n="10.220">Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes;</l>
<l n="10.221">Each step of passing feet increas'd th' affright;</l>
<l n="10.222">And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.</l>
<l n="10.223">Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,</l>
<l n="10.224">And thus accosted through the gloomy shade:</l>
</lg>
<pb n="180"/>
<lg>
<l n="10.225">''Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ,</l>
<l n="10.226">'Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.</l>
<l n="10.227">'Watch thus, and Greece shall live.' The hero said;</l>
<l n="10.228">Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.</l>
<l n="10.229">His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind;</l>
<l n="10.230">(For these the princes to their council join'd;)</l>
<l n="10.231">The trenches pass'd, th' assembled kings around</l>
<l n="10.232">In silent state the consistory crown'd.</l>
<l n="10.233">A place there was yet undefil'd with gore,</l>
<l n="10.234">The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before,</l>
<l n="10.235">When night, descending, from his vengeful hand</l>
<l n="10.236">Repriev'd the relics of the Grecian band.</l>
<l n="10.237">(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,</l>
<l n="10.238">And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead.)</l>
<l n="10.239">There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,</l>
<l n="10.240">The council opening, in these words begun:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.241">'Is there' (said he) 'a chief so greatly brave,</l>
<l n="10.242">'His life to hazard, and his country save?</l>
<l n="10.243">'Lives there a man, who singly dares to go</l>
<l n="10.244">'To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?</l>
<l n="10.245">'Or, favour'd by the night, approach so near,</l>
<l n="10.246">'Their speech, their counsels, and designs, to hear?</l>
<l n="10.247">'If to besiege our navies they prepare,</l>
<l n="10.248">'Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?</l>
<l n="10.249">'This could he learn and to our peers recite,</l>
<l n="10.250">'And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;</l>
<l n="10.251">'What fame were his through all succeeding days,</l>
<l n="10.252">'While Phœbus shines, or men have tongues to praise!</l>
<l n="10.253">'What gifts his grateful country would bestow!</l>
<l n="10.254">'What must not Greece to her deliverer owe!</l>
<l n="10.255">'A sable ewe<ref n="180.2">2</ref> each leader should provide,</l>
<l n="10.256">'With each a sable lambkin by her side;</l>
<l n="10.257">'At every rite his share should be increas'd,</l>
<l n="10.258">'And his the foremost honours of the feast.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.259">Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,</l>
<l n="10.260">Tydides spoke: 'The man you seek is here.</l>
<l n="10.261">'Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,</l>
<l n="10.262">'Some god within commands, and I obey.</l>
<l n="10.263">'But let some other chosen warrior join,</l>
<l n="10.264">'To raise my hopes and second my design.</l>
<l n="10.265">'By mutual confidence and mutual aid,</l>
<l n="10.266">'Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;</l>
<l n="10.267">'The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,</l>
<l n="10.268">'And one brave hero fans another's fire.'</l>

<lg>
<l n="10.269">Contending leaders at the word arose;</l>
<l n="10.270">Each generous breast with emulation glows:</l>
<l n="10.271">So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,</l>
<l n="10.272">Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;</l>
<l n="10.273">The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,</l>
<l n="10.274">And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.</l>
<l n="10.275">Then thus the king of men the contest ends:</l>
<l n="10.276">'Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,</l>
<l n="10.277">'Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join</l>
<l n="10.278">'In this great enterprise, is only thine.</l>
<l n="10.279">'Just be thy choice, without affection made,</l>
<l n="10.280">'To birth or office no respect be paid;</l>
<l n="10.281">'Let worth determine here.' The monarch spake,</l>
<l n="10.282">And inly trembled for his brother's sake.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.283">Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd):</l>
<l n="10.284">'My choice declares the impulse of my mind.</l>
<l n="10.285">'How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands</l>
<l n="10.286">'To lend his counsels, and assist our hands?</l>
<l n="10.287">'A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care:</l>
<l n="10.288">'So fam'd, so dreadful in the works of war:</l>
<l n="10.289">'Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require,</l>
<l n="10.290">'Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.291">'It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,'</l>
<l n="10.292">(Replied the sage,) 'to praise me, or to blame:</l>
<l n="10.293">'Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,</l>
<l n="10.294">'Are lost on hearers that our merits know.</l>
<l n="10.295">'But let us haste. Night rolls the hours away,</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.299">Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</l>
<l n="10.300">In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.</l>
<l n="10.301">A two-edg'd faulchion Thrasymed the brave,</l>
<l n="10.302">And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:</l>
<l n="10.303">Then in a leathern helm he cas'd his head,</l>

<l n="10.305">(Such as by youths, unus'd to arms, are worn;</l>
<l n="10.306">No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.)</l>
<l n="10.307">Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,</l>
<l n="10.308">A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stor'd:</l>
<l n="10.309">A well-prov'd casque, with leather braces bound,</l>

<l n="10.313">This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,</l>

<l n="10.317">The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,</l>
<l n="10.318">And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.</l>
<l n="10.319">Thus sheath'd in arms, the council they forsake,</l>
<l n="10.320">And dark through paths oblique their progress take.</l>
<l n="10.321">Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,</l>
<l n="10.322">A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:</l>
<l n="10.323">This, though surrounding shades obscur'd their view,</l>
<l n="10.324">By the shrill clang and whistling wings, they knew.</l>
<l n="10.325">As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,</l>
<l n="10.326">Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.327">'O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield</l>

<l n="10.331">'Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,</l>

<l n="10.335">Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:</l>

<l n="10.430">And from the herd still turn the flying prey:</l>
<l n="10.431">So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;</l>
<l n="10.432">So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.</l>
<l n="10.433">Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,</l>
<l n="10.434">And mingles with the guards that watch the walls:</l>
<l n="10.435">When brave Tydides stopp'd: a generous thought</l>
<l n="10.436">(Inspir'd by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,</l>
<l n="10.437">Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,</l>
<l n="10.438">And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.</l>
<l n="10.439">Then thus aloud: 'Whoe'er thou art, remain;</l>
<l n="10.440">'This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.'</l>
<l n="10.441">He said, and high in air the weapon cast,</l>
<l n="10.442">Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd:</l>
<l n="10.443">Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood</l>
<l n="10.444">The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;</l>
<l n="10.445">A sudden palsy seiz'd his turning head;</l>
<l n="10.446">His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled:</l>
<l n="10.447">The panting warriors seize him, as he stands,</l>
<l n="10.448">And, with unmanly tears, his life demands:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.449">'O spare my youth, and, for the breath I owe,</l>
<l n="10.450">'Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:</l>
</lg>
<pb n="185"/>

<lg>
<l n="10.451">'Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,</l>
<l n="10.452">'And steel well-temper'd, and refulgent gold.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.453">To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:</l>
<l n="10.454">'Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.</l>
<l n="10.455">'What moves thee, say, when sleep has clos'd the sight,</l>
<l n="10.456">'To roam the silent fields in dead of night?</l>
<l n="10.457">'Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,</l>
<l n="10.458">'By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?</l>
<l n="10.459">'Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led</l>
<l n="10.460">'Through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.461">Then thus pale Dolon with a fearful look:</l>
<l n="10.462">(Still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook:)</l>
<l n="10.463">'Hither I came, by Hector's words deceiv'd:</l>
<l n="10.464">'Much did he promise, rashly I believ'd:</l>
<l n="10.465">'No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,</l>
<l n="10.466">'And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,</l>
<l n="10.467">'Urg'd me, unwilling, this attempt to make;<ref n="185.5">5</ref></l>
<l n="10.468">'To learn what counsels, what resolves, you take:</l>
<l n="10.469">'If now, subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,</l>
<l n="10.470">'And, tir'd with toils, neglect the watch of night?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.471">'Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,'</l>
<l n="10.472">(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies;)</l>
<l n="10.473">'Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,</l>
<l n="10.474">'And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;</l>
<l n="10.475">'E'en great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,</l>
<l n="10.476">'Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.</l>
<l n="10.477">'But say, be faithful, and the truth recite:</l>
<l n="10.478">'Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night?</l>
<l n="10.479">'Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep</l>
<l n="10.480">'Their other princes? tell what watch they keep.</l>
<l n="10.481">'Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;</l>
<l n="10.482">'Or here to combat, from their city far,</l>
<l n="10.483">'Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="10.484">Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:</l>
<l n="10.485">'What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.</l>
<l n="10.486">'Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,</l>
<l n="10.487">'A council holds at Ilus' monument.</l>
<l n="10.488">'No certain guards the nightly watch partake:</l>
<l n="10.489">'Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:</l>
<l n="10.490">'Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep:</l>

<l n="10.494">'Then sleep these aids among the Trojan train,'</l>

<l n="10.570">Ulysses following as his partner slew,</l>
<l n="10.571">Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew;</l>
<l n="10.572">The milk-white coursers studious to convey</l>

<l n="10.613">For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most.</l>

<l n="10.615">The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain;</l>
<l n="10.616">On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,</l>

<title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
</ab>
<ab>
<title type="sub">THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.</title>
</ab>
<p>Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector prepares the Trojans to receive them: while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him; and Hector is commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the engagement, till the king should be wounded and retire from the field. He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy; Ulysses and Diomede put a stop to him for a time; but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in Nestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship) sends Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that manner. Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he had remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it clad in Achilles' armour. Patroclus in his return meets Eurypylus also wounded, and assists in that distress.</p>
<p>This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem; and the same day, with its various actions and adventures, is extended through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the monu­ ment of Ilus.</p>
<lg>
<l n="11.1">THE saffron morn, with early blushes spread,</l>
<l n="11.2">Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;</l>
<l n="11.3">With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</l>
<l n="11.4">And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:</l>
<l n="11.5">When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,</l>
<l n="11.6">The torch of discord blazing in her hand,</l>
<l n="11.7">Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,</l>
<l n="11.8">And, wrapp'd in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.</l>
<l n="11.9">High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand</l>
<l n="11.10">She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.</l>
<l n="11.11">E'en Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,</l>
<l n="11.12">Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound.</l>
<l n="11.13">Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng</l>
<l n="11.14">With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:<ref n="190.1">1</ref></l>
</lg>
<note n="190.1">1 This is a kind of Odaic song, invented and sung on purpose to fire the soul to noble deeds in war. Such was that of Timotheus before Alexander the Great, which had such an influence upon him, that he leaped from his seat, and laid hold on his arms. EUSTATHIUS. Pope.</note>

<l n="11.15">The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms</l>

<l n="11.22">His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd.</l>
<l n="11.23">And first he cas'd his manly legs around</l>

<l n="11.548">Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,</l>
<l n="11.549">Plough'd half his side, and bar'd it to the bone.</l>

<l n="11.551">Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.</l>

<lg>
<l n="11.552">The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,</l>

<l n="11.556">'No longer check my conquests on the foe;</l>
<l n="11.557">'But, pierc'd by this, to endless darkness go,</l>
<l n="11.558">'And add one spectre to the realms below!'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.559">He spoke, while Socus, seiz'd with sudden fright,</l>
<l n="11.560">Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight,</l>
<l n="11.561">Between his shoulders pierc'd the following dart,</l>

<l n="11.563">Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;</l>
<l n="11.564">He falls: his armour rings against the ground.</l>
<l n="11.565">Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:</l>

<l n="11.575">Then, raging with intolerable smart,</l>
<l n="11.576">He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.</l>
<l n="11.577">The dart a tide of spouting gore pursu'd,</l>
<l n="11.578">And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.</l>
<l n="11.579">Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade;</l>
<l n="11.580">Forc'd he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.</l>

<l n="11.604">The lordly savage vindicates his prey.</l>
<l n="11.605">Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,</l>
<l n="11.606">A single warrior, half a host sustains:</l>
<l n="11.607">But soon as Ajax heaves his tower-like shield,</l>
<l n="11.608">The scatter'd crowds fly frighted o'er the field:</l>
<l n="11.609">Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,</l>
<l n="11.610">And, sav'd from numbers, to his car conveys.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.611">Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;</l>
<l n="11.612">And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew:</l>
<l n="11.613">On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,</l>
<l n="11.614">And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.</l>
<l n="11.615">As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,</l>
<l n="11.616">Pours from the mountains o'er the delug'd plains,</l>
<l n="11.617">And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,</l>
<l n="11.618">A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:</l>
<l n="11.619">Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;</l>
<l n="11.620">Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.621">But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,</l>
<l n="11.622">Rag'd on the left, and rul'd the tide of war:</l>
<l n="11.623">Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,</l>
<l n="11.624">And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.</l>
<l n="11.625">There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose</l>
<l n="11.626">The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;</l>
<l n="11.627">There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,</l>
<l n="11.628">His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.</l>
<l n="11.629">The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,</l>
<l n="11.630">Had pierc'd Machaon with a distant wound:</l>
<l n="11.631">In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,</l>
<l n="11.632">And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.</l>
<l n="11.633">To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:</l>
<l n="11.634">'Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!</l>
</lg>
<pb n="205"/>

<lg>
<l n="11.635">'Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,</l>
<l n="11.636">'And great Machaon to the ships convey.</l>
<l n="11.637">'A wise physician, skill'd our wounds to heal,</l>
<l n="11.638">'Is more than armies to the public weal.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.639">Old Nestor mounts the seat. Beside him rode</l>
<l n="11.640">The wounded offspring of the healing god.</l>
<l n="11.641">He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet</l>
<l n="11.642">Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.643">But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,</l>
<l n="11.644">Survey'd the various fortune of the war.</l>
<l n="11.645">'While here' (he cried) 'the flying Greeks are slain,</l>
<l n="11.646">'Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.</l>
<l n="11.647">'Before great Ajax, see the mingled throng</l>
<l n="11.648">'Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!</l>
<l n="11.649">'I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field</l>
<l n="11.650">'By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.</l>
<l n="11.651">'Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,</l>
<l n="11.652">'There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;</l>
<l n="11.653">'There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,</l>
<l n="11.654">'And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.655">Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;</l>
<l n="11.656">Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;</l>
<l n="11.657">Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,</l>
<l n="11.658">O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.</l>
<l n="11.659">The horses' hoofs are bath'd in heroes' gore,</l>
<l n="11.660">And, dashing, purple all the car before:</l>
<l n="11.661">The groaning axle sable drops distils,</l>
<l n="11.662">And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.</l>
<l n="11.663">Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,</l>
<l n="11.664">Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:</l>
<l n="11.665">(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,</l>
<l n="11.666">The ranks lie scatter'd, and the troops o'erthrown.)</l>
<l n="11.667">Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,</l>
<l n="11.668">And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.</l>
<l n="11.669">But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,</l>
<l n="11.670">Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;</l>
<l n="11.671">Confus'd, unnerv'd in Hector's presence grown,</l>
<l n="11.672">Amaz'd he stood, with terrors not his own.</l>
<l n="11.673">O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,</l>
<l n="11.674">And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.</l>
<l n="11.675">Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,</l>
<l n="11.676">Beset with watchful dogs and shouting swains,</l>
<l n="11.677">Repuls'd by numbers from the nightly stalls,</l>
<l n="11.678">Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,</l>
<l n="11.679">Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;</l>
<l n="11.680">Then sourly slow th' indignant beast retires.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="206"/>
<lg>
<l n="11.681">So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,</l>
<l n="11.682">While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.683">As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,</l>
<l n="11.684">In some wide field by troops of boys pursu'd,</l>
<l n="11.685">Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,</l>
<l n="11.686">Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;</l>
<l n="11.687">Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound;</l>
<l n="11.688">The patient animal maintains his ground;</l>
<l n="11.689">Scarce from the field with all their efforts chas'd,</l>
<l n="11.690">And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last.</l>
<l n="11.691">On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,</l>
<l n="11.692">The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;</l>
<l n="11.693">Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,</l>
<l n="11.694">Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;</l>
<l n="11.695">Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,</l>
<l n="11.696">And threats his followers with retorted eye.</l>
<l n="11.697">Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,</l>
<l n="11.698">While hissing darts descend in iron showers:</l>
<l n="11.699">In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,</l>
<l n="11.700">Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;</l>
<l n="11.701">And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,</l>
<l n="11.702">Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.</l>
<l n="11.703">But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,</l>
<l n="11.704">And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;</l>
<l n="11.705">Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,</l>
<l n="11.706">Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;</l>
<l n="11.707">From his torn liver the red current flow'd,</l>
<l n="11.708">And his slack knees desert their dying load.</l>
<l n="11.709">The victor rushing to despoil the dead,</l>
<l n="11.710">From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled:</l>
<l n="11.711">Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,</l>
<l n="11.712">Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.</l>
<l n="11.713">Back to the lines the wounded Greek retir'd,</l>
<l n="11.714">Yet thus, retreating, his associates fir'd:</l>
<l n="11.715">'What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?</l>
<l n="11.716">'Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.</l>
<l n="11.717">'This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,</l>
<l n="11.718">'And this the last brave battle he shall wage:</l>
<l n="11.719">'Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave</l>
<l n="11.720">'The warrior rescue, and your country save.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.721">Thus urg'd the chief; a generous troop appears,</l>
<l n="11.722">Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,</l>
<l n="11.723">To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand</l>
<l n="11.724">With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:</l>
<l n="11.725">Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;</l>
<l n="11.726">The hero rallies and renews the fight.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="207"/>

<lg>
<l n="11.727">Thus rag'd both armies like conflicting fires,</l>
<l n="11.728">While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:</l>
<l n="11.729">His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,</l>
<l n="11.730">The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.</l>
<l n="11.731">That hour, Achilles, from the topmost height</l>
<l n="11.732">Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;</l>
<l n="11.733">His feasted eyes beheld around the plain</l>
<l n="11.734">The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.</l>
<l n="11.735">His friend Machaon singled from the rest,</l>
<l n="11.736">A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.</l>
<l n="11.737">Straight to Menœtius' much-lov'd son he sent;</l>
<l n="11.738">Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent:</l>
<l n="11.739">In evil hour! then fate decreed his doom;</l>
<l n="11.740">And fix'd the date of all his woes to come!</l>

<l n="11.745">'The time is come, when yon despairing host</l>
<l n="11.746">'Shall learn the value of the man they lost:</l>
<l n="11.747">'Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,</l>
<l n="11.748">'And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.</l>
<l n="11.749">'Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught</l>
<l n="11.750">'What wounded warrior late his chariot brought?</l>
<l n="11.751">'For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,</l>

<l n="11.761">Here paus'd a moment, while the gentle gale</l>
<l n="11.762">Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;</l>
<l n="11.763">Then to consult on farther methods went,</l>

<l n="11.773">Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,</l>

<l n="11.776">Two feet support it, and four handles hold;</l>
<l n="11.777">On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,</l>
<l n="11.778">In sculptur'd gold, two turtles seem to drink:</l>
<l n="11.779">A massy weight, yet heav'd with ease by him,</l>

<l n="11.781">Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine</l>

<l n="11.903">'O friend! my memory recalls the day,</l>
<l n="11.904">'When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,</l>
<l n="11.905">'I, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,</l>
<l n="11.906">'And enter'd Peleus' hospitable court.</l>
<l n="11.907">'A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,</l>
<l n="11.908">'And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.</l>
<l n="11.909">'Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire</l>
<l n="11.910">'Menœtius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.</l>
<l n="11.911">'Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;</l>
<l n="11.912">'Social we sit, and share the genial rites.</l>
<l n="11.913">'We then explain'd the cause on which we came,</l>
<l n="11.914">'Urg'd you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.</l>
<l n="11.915">'Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave:</l>
<l n="11.916">'Peleus said only this: "My son! be brave,"</l>
<l n="11.917">'Menœtius thus: "Though great Achilles shine</l>
<l n="11.918">'"In strength superior, and of race divine,</l>
<l n="11.919">'"Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;</l>
<l n="11.920">'"Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend."'</l>
<l n="11.921">'Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court;</l>
<l n="11.922">'Words now forgot, though now of vast import.</l>
<l n="11.923">'Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say,</l>
<l n="11.924">'Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;</l>
<l n="11.925">'Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move;</l>
<l n="11.926">'Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.</l>
<l n="11.927">'If some dire oracle his breast alarm,</l>
<l n="11.928">'If aught from heaven withhold his saving arm;</l>
<l n="11.929">'Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,</l>
<l n="11.930">'If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;</l>
<l n="11.931">'Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,</l>
<l n="11.932">'Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war!</l>
<l n="11.933">'Press'd by fresh forces, her o'erlabour'd train</l>
<l n="11.934">'Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again.'</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l n="11.935">This touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent</l>
<l n="11.936">Along the shore with hasty strides he went;</l>
<l n="11.937">Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,</l>

<l n="11.939">Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,</l>

<l n="11.943">An arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,</l>
<l n="11.944">The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground,</l>
<l n="11.945">As, faintly reeling, he confess'd the smart:</l>
<l n="11.946">Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.</l>
<l n="11.947">Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,</l>

          </ab>
          <p>The Greeks being retired into their entrenchments, Hector attempts to force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas ad­ vises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans follow his counsel, and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas en­ deavours to withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall: Hector also, casting a stone of a vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the head of his troops, who victo­ riously pursue the Grecians even to their ships.</p>

            <l n="12.8">The walls are rais'd, the trenches sunk, in vain.</l>

            <l n="12.34">No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;</l>

            <l n="12.39">The strokes yet echo'd of contending powers;</l>
            <l n="12.40">War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.</l>
            <l n="12.41">Smote by the arm of Jove, and dire dismay,</l>
            <l n="12.42">Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay;</l>
            <l n="12.43">Hector's approach in every wind they hear,</l>

            <l n="12.48">Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;</l>
            <l n="12.49">Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,</l>
            <l n="12.50">And hissing javelins rain an iron storm;</l>
            <l n="12.51">His powers untam'd their bold assault defy,</l>

            <l n="12.53">He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,</l>
            <l n="12.54">And, if he falls, his courage makes him fall.</l>
            <l n="12.55">With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;</l>
            <l n="12.56">Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.</l>
            <l n="12.57">The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,</l>
            <l n="12.58">But snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;</l>
            <l n="12.59">Just on the brink, they neigh, and paw the ground,</l>
            <l n="12.60">And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.</l>
            <l n="12.61">Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,</l>
            <l n="12.62">Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;</l>
            <l n="12.63">The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)</l>
            <l n="12.64">And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.</l>
            <l n="12.65">The foot alone this strong defence could force,</l>

            <l n="12.67">This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,</l>

          </ab>
          <p>Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the fortifica­ tion forced by Hector (who had entered the gate near the station of the Ajaxes), assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires those heroes to oppose him; then, in the form of one of the generals, encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The Ajaxes form their troops into a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones, losing his spear in the encounter, re­ pairs to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conver­ sation between these two warriors, who return together to the battle. Ido­ meneus signalizes his courage above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed in the left wing. Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaxes, till, being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to call a council of war: Hector approves his advice, but goes first to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again, and renews the attack.</p>
          <p>The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the Grecian wall and the sea shore.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing clamour of the war, and hastens to Agamemnon: on his way he meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence; which advice is pursued. Juno seeing the parti­ ality of Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to overreach him; she sets off her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god of Sleep, and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter; this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the Greeks; Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed; till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way; the lesser Ajax signalizes him­ self in a particular manner.</p>
          <p>The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the Grecian wall and the sea shore.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks; he is highly incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions; she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of the gods, attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against Ju­ piter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo rein­ spires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle marches be­ fore him with his ægis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall; the Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are yet repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.</p>

          <note n="267.2">2 The ancients have affirmed of Homer that examples of all kinds of oratory are to be found in him. The present speech of Juno is considered a masterpiece—she seems to say one thing, and persuades another. For while she is only declaring to the gods the orders of Jupiter, at the same time that she tells them they must obey, she fills them with a reluctance to do it. By representing so strongly the superiority of his power, she makes them uneasy at it, and by particularly advising that god to submit, whose temper could least brook it, she incites him to downright rebellion. Nothing can be more sly and artfully provoking, than that stroke on the death of his darling son. Pope.</note>

          </ab>
          <p>Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)
            entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with
            Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time
            charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without farther
            pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers of
            Achilles are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his
            friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The
            Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for
            that hero, are cast into the utmost consternation: he beats them off
            from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter
            was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are
            described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of
            Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy; where Apollo repulses
            and disarms him. Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him:
            which concludes the book.</p>

          <note n="288.1">1 Eustathius informs us, that some of the ancients rejected this wish with which Achilles concludes his answer, on account of its impossibility, and the extravagant ambition that it discovers. But their reasons were not good; for, in respect of manners, the poet constantly represents his hero, not such as he ought to have been, but such as he was reported; and as to the extravagance of it, it is not greater than Diomed uses, when he declares that, if all renounce the siege, himself and Sthenelus alone will continue it till Troy be taken. Cowper. See B. ix. 65.</note>

          </ab>
          <p>Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:
            Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus
            retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This Glaucus
            objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had
            won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till
            Ajax rallies them: Æneas sustains the Trojans. Æneas and Hector
            attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The
            horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body
            with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.
            Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus's
            death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the
            utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaxes, bear off the body
            to the ships.</p>
          <p>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies
            in the fields before Troy.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus. Thetis hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea-nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him turns the fortune of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas dis<pb n="329"/>

          <p>Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan, to obtain new arms for her son. The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan; and, lastly, that noble one of the shield of Achilles.</p>
          <p>The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take up this book. The scene is at Achilles's tent on the sea-shore, from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.</p>

<l n="18.1">THUS like the rage of fire the combat burns,</l>
            <l n="18.2">And now it rises, now it sinks, by turns.</l>
            <l n="18.3">Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,</l>
            <l n="18.4">Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe.</l>

            <l n="18.6">On hoisted yards extended to the gales;</l>
            <l n="18.7">Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd</l>
            <l n="18.8">Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.</l>
            <l n="18.9">Thus to his soul he said: ‘Ah what constrains</l>
            <l n="18.10">‘The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains ?</l>
            <l n="18.11">‘Is this the day, which heaven so long ago</l>

<lg>
<l n="18.19">Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,</l>
            <l n="18.20">And tells the melancholy tale with tears:</l>
            <l n="18.21">‘Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;</l>

            <l n="18.24">‘His naked corse: his arms are Hector's right.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="18.25">A sudden horror shot through all the chief,</l>
            <l n="18.26">And wrapt his senses in the cloud of grief;</l>
            <l n="18.27">Cast on the ground, with furious hand he spread</l>
            <l n="18.28">The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head;</l>
            <l n="18.29">His purple garments, and his golden hairs,</l>
            <l n="18.30">Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears:</l>
            <l n="18.31">On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,</l>
            <l n="18.32">And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew.</l>
            <l n="18.33">The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms,</l>

            <l n="18.36">Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:</l>
            <l n="18.37">While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part,</l>

          </ab>
          <p>Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves, by the advice of Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles: where Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight; his appearance described. He addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his fate; but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.</p>
          <p>The thirtieth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.</p>
          <lg>
<l n="19.1">SOON as Aurora heaved her orient head</l>
            <l n="19.2">Above the waves that blushed with early red,</l>
            <l n="19.3">(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</l>
            <l n="19.4">And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)</l>
            <l n="19.5">Th' immortal arms the goddess-mother bears</l>
            <l n="19.6">Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears,</l>
            <l n="19.7">Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse, while all the rest</l>
            <l n="19.8">Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.</l>
            <l n="19.9">A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,</l>
            <l n="19.10">And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:</l>

          <lg>
<l n="19.11">‘Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know</l>
            <l n="19.12">‘It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow:</l>

<l n="19.15">Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;</l>
            <l n="19.16">Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;</l>

            <l n="19.19">Unmov'd, the hero kindles at the show,</l>
            <l n="19.20">And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;</l>
            <l n="19.21">From his fierce eye-balls living flames expire,</l>
            <l n="19.22">And flash incessant like a stream of fire:</l>

<l n="19.31">‘That unavailing care be laid aside,’</l>
            <l n="19.32">(The azure goddess to her son replied;)</l>
            <l n="19.33">‘Whole years untouch'd, uninjur'd shall remain,</l>

          <p>Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the gods, and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat described when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Æneas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.</p>

            <l n="20.489">Full in Achilles' dreadful front he came,</l>

            <l n="20.491">The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,</l>

          </ab>
          <p>The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the river Scamander; he falls upon the latter with great slaughter, takes twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills Lycaon and Asteropæus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves; Neptune and Pallas assist the hero; Simois joins Scamander; at length Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter, and drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo: who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's shape, and while he pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city.</p>
          <p>The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of Scamander.</p>
          <lg>
<l n="21.1">AND now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,</l>
            <l n="21.2">Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.</l>
            <l n="21.3">The river here divides the flying train:</l>
            <l n="21.4">Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,</l>
            <l n="21.5">Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,</l>
            <l n="21.6">Now chas'd and trembling in ignoble flight:</l>
            <l n="21.7">(These with a gather'd mist Saturnia shrouds,</l>
            <l n="21.8">And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds;)</l>
            <l n="21.9">Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars;</l>
            <l n="21.10">The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:</l>
            <pb n="371"/>

            <l n="21.11">With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,</l>
            <l n="21.12">And here and there, in eddies whirling round,</l>
            <l n="21.13">The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.</l>
            <l n="21.14">As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,</l>
            <l n="21.15">While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;</l>
            <l n="21.16">Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</l>
            <l n="21.17">The clustering legions rush into the flood:</l>
            <l n="21.18">So plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,</l>
            <l n="21.19">Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</l>
            <l n="21.20">His bloody lance the hero casts aside,</l>
            <l n="21.21">(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)</l>
            <l n="21.22">Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</l>
            <l n="21.23">Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves;</l>
            <l n="21.24">Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</l>

            <l n="21.26">Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</l>
            <l n="21.27">And the warm purple circled on the tide.</l>
            <l n="21.28">Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,</l>
            <l n="21.29">And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</l>

            <l n="21.32">Confus'dly heap'd, they seek their inmost caves,</l>
            <l n="21.33">Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</l>
            <l n="21.34">Now, tir'd with slaughter, from the Trojan band</l>
            <l n="21.35">Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;</l>
            <l n="21.36">With their rich belts their captive arms constrains;</l>
            <l n="21.37">(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains;)</l>

          </ab>
          <p>The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but, at the advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies: Achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles. She deludes Hector in the shape of Deïphobus; he stands the combat, and is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot, in the sight of Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of the palace; she mounts up to the walls, and beholds her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and lamentation.</p>
          <p>The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on the battlements of Troy.</p>

            <l n="22.2">The herded Ilians rush like driven deer;</l>

            <l n="22.4">And drown in bowls the labours of the day.</l>
            <l n="22.5">Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields,</l>
            <l n="22.6">Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,</l>
            <l n="22.7">March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,</l>

<l n="22.31">Then to the city, terrible and strong,</l>
            <l n="22.32">With high and haughty steps he tower'd along:</l>

            <l n="22.35">Him, as he blazing shot across the field,</l>
            <l n="22.36">The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.</l>
            <l n="22.37">Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,</l>
            <l n="22.38">Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,</l>
            <l n="22.39">Orion's dog, (the year when autumn weighs,)</l>

            <l n="22.156">'The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance lay down,</l>

<lg>
<l n="22.173">Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh:</l>
            <l n="22.174">His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;</l>
            <l n="22.175">The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,</l>
            <l n="22.176">Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;</l>
            <l n="22.177">And on his breast the beamy splendours shone</l>
            <l n="22.178">Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.</l>
            <l n="22.179">As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,</l>
            <l n="22.180">Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies:</l>
            <l n="22.181">He leaves the gates, he leaves the walls behind;</l>
            <l n="22.182">Achilles follows like the winged wind.</l>

            <l n="22.189">No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,</l>
            <l n="22.190">One urg'd by fury, one by fear impell'd;</l>
            <l n="22.191">Now circling round the walls their course maintain,</l>

            <l n="22.195">Next by Scamander's double source they bound,</l>
            <l n="22.196">Where two fam'd fountains burst the parted ground:</l>
            <l n="22.197">This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,</l>
            <l n="22.198">With exhalations steaming to the skies;</l>
            <l n="22.199">That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,</l>
            <l n="22.200">Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows.</l>
            <l n="22.201">Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,</l>

            <pb n="392"/>
            <l n="22.203">Where Trojan dames (e'er yet alarm'd by Greece)</l>
            <l n="22.204">Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.</l>
            <l n="22.205">By these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight;</l>
            <l n="22.206">(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might;)</l>
            <l n="22.207">Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,</l>
            <l n="22.208">No vulgar victim must reward the day;</l>
            <l n="22.209">(Such as in races crown the speedy strife;)</l>
            <l n="22.210">The prize contended was great Hector's life.</l>

</lg>
          <lg>
<l n="22.211">As when some hero's funerals are decreed,</l>
            <l n="22.212">In grateful honour of the mighty dead;</l>
            <l n="22.213">Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame,</l>
            <l n="22.214">(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame,)</l>
            <l n="22.215">The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,</l>
            <l n="22.216">And with them turns the rais'd spectator's soul:</l>
            <l n="22.217">Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly;</l>
            <l n="22.218">The gazing gods lean forward from the sky:</l>
            <l n="22.219">To whom, while eager on the chase they look,</l>
            <l n="22.220">The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:</l>

</lg>
          <lg>
<l n="22.221">'Unworthy sight! the man, belov'd of heaven,</l>
            <l n="22.222">'Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!</l>
            <l n="22.223">'My heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;</l>
            <l n="22.224">'Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,</l>
            <l n="22.225">'Whose grateful fumes the gods receiv'd with joy,</l>
            <l n="22.226">'From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:</l>
            <l n="22.227">'Now see him flying! to his fears resign'd,</l>
            <l n="22.228">'And Fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.</l>
            <l n="22.229">'Consult, ye powers ('tis worthy your debate)</l>
            <l n="22.230">'Whether to snatch him from impending fate,</l>
            <l n="22.231">'Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,</l>
            <l n="22.232">'(Good as he is,) the lot impos'd on man?’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.233">Then Pallas thus: 'Shall he whose vengeance forms</l>
            <l n="22.234">'The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,</l>
            <l n="22.235">'Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath,</l>
            <l n="22.236">'A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death?</l>
            <l n="22.237">'And will no murmurs fill the courts above?</l>
            <l n="22.238">'No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.239">'Go then,’ (return'd the sire,) 'without delay;</l>
            <l n="22.240">'Exert thy will: I give the fates their way.’</l>
            <l n="22.241">Swift at the mandate pleas'd Tritonia flies,</l>
            <l n="22.242">And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.243">As through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,</l>

            <l n="22.249">Thus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,</l>
            <l n="22.250">There swift Achilles compass'd round the field.</l>
            <l n="22.251">Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,</l>
            <l n="22.252">And hopes th' assistance of his pitying friends,</l>
            <l n="22.253">(Whose showering arrows, as he cours'd below,</l>
            <l n="22.254">From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)</l>
            <l n="22.255">So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:</l>
            <l n="22.256">He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.</l>
            <l n="22.257">As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace</l>
            <l n="22.258">One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,</l>
            <l n="22.259">Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,</l>
            <l n="22.260">Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:</l>
            <l n="22.261">No less the labouring heroes pant and strain;</l>
            <l n="22.262">While that but flies, and this pursues, in vain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.263">What god, O Muse! assisted Hector's force,</l>
            <l n="22.264">With Fate itself so long to hold the course?</l>
            <l n="22.265">Phœbus it was: who, in his latest hour,</l>
            <l n="22.266">Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:</l>
            <l n="22.267">And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance</l>
            <l n="22.268">Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,</l>
            <l n="22.269">Sign'd to the troops, to yield his foe the way,</l>
            <l n="22.270">And leave untouch'd the honours of the day.</l>

</lg>
          <lg>
<l n="22.271">Jove lifts the golden balances, that show</l>
            <l n="22.272">The fates of mortal men, and things below:</l>
            <l n="22.273">Here each contending hero's lot he tries,</l>

            <l n="22.275">Low sinks the scale surcharg'd with Hector's fate;</l>
            <l n="22.276">Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.</l>

<lg>
<l n="22.277">Then Phœbus left him. Fierce Minerva flies</l>

            <l n="22.281">'Great Hector falls; that Hector fam'd so far,</l>
            <l n="22.282">'Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,</l>
            <l n="22.283">'Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force nor flight</l>
            <l n="22.284">'Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.</l>
            <l n="22.285">'See, where in vain he supplicates above,</l>

            <l n="22.287">'Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.289">Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind</l>
            <l n="22.290">Obey'd, and rested, on his lance reclin'd.</l>
            <l n="22.291">While like Deïphobus the martial dame,</l>
            <l n="22.292">(Her face, her gesture, and her arms, the same,)</l>
            <l n="22.293">In show an aid, by hapless Hector's side</l>
            <l n="22.294">Approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:</l>
            <pb n="394"/>
            <l n="22.295">'Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight</l>
            <l n="22.296">'Of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:</l>
            <l n="22.297">'It fits us now a noble stand to make,</l>
            <l n="22.298">'And here, as brothers, equal fates partake.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.299">Then he: 'O prince! allied in blood and fame,</l>
            <l n="22.300">'Dearer than all that own a brother's name;</l>
            <l n="22.301">'Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,</l>
            <l n="22.302">'Long tried, long lov'd; much lov'd, but honour'd more!</l>
            <l n="22.303">'Since you of all our numerous race alone</l>
            <l n="22.304">'Defend my life, regardless of your own.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.305">Again the goddess: 'Much my father's prayer,</l>
            <l n="22.306">'And much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:</l>
            <l n="22.307">'My friends embraced my knees, adjur'd my stay,</l>

            <l n="22.312">'Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="22.313">Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before;</l>
            <l n="22.314">The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.</l>
            <l n="22.315">Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke;</l>
            <l n="22.316">His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:</l>

<lg>
<l n="22.317">'Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd</l>

<lg>
<l n="22.333">'Talk not of oaths,’ (the dreadful chief replies,</l>

<l n="22.349">He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;</l>

<lg>
<l n="22.389">Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,</l>

<lg>
<l n="22.459">Achilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes</l>

          </ab>
          <p>Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial: the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly, twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays libations to the winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise the flame. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the cæstus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.</p>
          <p>In this book ends the thirtieth day: the night following, the ghost of Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile; the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the sea-shore.</p>

<l n="23.1">THUS humbled in the dust, the pensive train</l>
            <l n="23.2">Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.</l>
            <l n="23.3">The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,</l>
            <l n="23.4">Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore:</l>
            <l n="23.5">The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,</l>
            <l n="23.6">All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:</l>
            <l n="23.7">These yet assembled great Achilles holds,</l>
            <l n="23.8">And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.9">‘Not yet (my brave companions of the war)</l>
            <l n="23.10">‘Release your smoking coursers from the car;</l>
            <l n="23.11">‘But with his chariot each in order led,</l>
            <l n="23.12">‘Perform due honours to Patroclus dead;</l>
            <l n="23.13">‘Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,</l>
            <l n="23.14">‘Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.15">The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led</l>
            <l n="23.16">(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;</l>
            <l n="23.17">And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;</l>
            <l n="23.18">Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.</l>
            <l n="23.19">For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,</l>
            <l n="23.20">Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.</l>
            <l n="23.21">But chief, Pelides; thick-succeeding sighs</l>
            <l n="23.22">Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:</l>
            <l n="23.23">His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid</l>
            <l n="23.24">On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.25">‘All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost</l>
            <l n="23.26">‘Hear and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;</l>
            <l n="23.27">‘Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;</l>
            <l n="23.28">‘The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.</l>
            <l n="23.29">‘Lo! to the dogs his carcass I resign;</l>
            <l n="23.30">‘And twelve sad victims of the Trojan line,</l>
            <l n="23.31">‘Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire,</l>
            <l n="23.32">‘Their lives effus'd around thy funeral pyre.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.33">Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)</l>
            <l n="23.34">Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,</l>
            <l n="23.35">Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around</l>
            <l n="23.36">Unbrac'd their armour, and the steeds unbound.</l>
            <l n="23.37">All to Achilles' sable ship repair,</l>
            <l n="23.38">Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.</l>
            <l n="23.39">Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,</l>
            <l n="23.40">The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire;</l>
            <l n="23.41">The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries</l>
            <l n="23.42">Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.</l>
            <l n="23.43">Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,</l>
            <l n="23.44">In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.</l>
            <l n="23.45">And now a band of Argive monarchs brings</l>
            <l n="23.46">The glorious victor to the king of kings.</l>
            <l n="23.47">From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,</l>
            <l n="23.48">With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.</l>

            <l n="23.751">Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.752">The prizes next are order'd to the field,</l>
            <l n="23.753">For the bold champions who the cæstus wield.</l>
            <l n="23.754">A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,</l>
            <l n="23.755">Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,</l>
            <l n="23.756">Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;</l>
            <l n="23.757">Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.</l>
            <l n="23.758">Achilles rising thus: ‘Let Greece excite</l>
            <l n="23.759">‘Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;</l>
            <l n="23.760">‘Who dares his foe with lifted arms provoke,</l>
            <l n="23.761">‘And rush beneath the long-descending stroke,</l>
            <l n="23.762">‘On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,</l>
            <l n="23.763">‘And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,</l>
            <l n="23.764">‘This mule his dauntless labour shall repay;</l>
            <l n="23.765">‘The vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.766">The dreadful combat great Epëus chose:</l>
            <l n="23.767">High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,</l>
            <l n="23.768">And seiz'd the beast, and thus began to say:</l>
            <l n="23.769">‘Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!</l>
            <l n="23.770">‘(Price of his ruin:) for who dares deny</l>
            <l n="23.771">‘This mule my right? th' undoubted victor I.</l>
            <l n="23.772">‘Others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,</l>
            <l n="23.773">‘But the first honours of this fight are mine;</l>
            <l n="23.774">‘For who excels in all? Then let my foe</l>
            <l n="23.775">‘Draw near, but first his certain fortune know,</l>
            <l n="23.776">‘Secure, this hand shall his whole frame confound,</l>
            <l n="23.777">‘Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:</l>
            <pb n="420"/>
            <l n="23.778">‘So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,</l>
            <l n="23.779">‘To heave the batter'd carcass off the plain.’</l>

</lg>
          <lg>
<l n="23.780">The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze</l>
            <l n="23.781">The host beheld him, silent with amaze!</l>
            <l n="23.782">'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire</l>
            <l n="23.783">To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,</l>
            <l n="23.784">The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore</l>
            <l n="23.785">In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,</l>
            <l n="23.786">(The games ordain'd dead Œdipus to grace,)</l>
            <l n="23.787">And singly vanquish'd the Cadmean race.</l>
            <l n="23.788">Him great Tydides urges to contend,</l>
            <l n="23.789">Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;</l>
            <l n="23.790">Officious with the cincture girds him round;</l>
            <l n="23.791">And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.</l>
            <l n="23.792">Amid the circle now each champion stands,</l>
            <l n="23.793">And poises high in air his iron hands:</l>
            <l n="23.794">With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,</l>
            <l n="23.795">Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,</l>
            <l n="23.796">And painful sweat from all their members flows.</l>
            <l n="23.797">At length Epëus dealt a weighty blow</l>
            <l n="23.798">Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;</l>
            <l n="23.799">Beneath that pondrous arm's resistless sway</l>
            <l n="23.800">Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.</l>
            <l n="23.801">As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,</l>
            <l n="23.802">By some huge billow dash'd against the shore,</l>
            <l n="23.803">Lies panting: not less batter'd with his wound,</l>
            <l n="23.804">The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.</l>
            <l n="23.805">To rear his fallen foe the victor lends,</l>
            <l n="23.806">Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;</l>
            <l n="23.807">Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,</l>
            <l n="23.808">And dragging his disabled legs along;</l>
            <l n="23.809">Nodding, his head hangs down, his shoulder o'er;</l>
            <l n="23.810">His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;</l>
            <l n="23.811">Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;</l>
            <l n="23.812">His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.813">The third bold game Achilles next demands,</l>
            <l n="23.814">And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:</l>
            <l n="23.815">A massy tripod for the victor lies,</l>
            <l n="23.816">Of twice six oxen its reputed price:</l>
            <l n="23.817">And next, the loser's spirits to restore,</l>
            <l n="23.818">A female captive, valued but at four.</l>
            <l n="23.819">Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose,</l>
            <l n="23.820">When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.</l>
            <l n="23.821">Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,</l>
            <l n="23.822">Embracing rigid with implicit hands:</l>
            <l n="23.823">Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd;</l>
            <l n="23.824">Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd:</l>

            <note type="margin"> B. XXIII.] </note><l/>
            <l n="23.825">Like two strong rafters, which the builder forms</l>
            <l n="23.826">Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,</l>
            <l n="23.827">Their tops connected, but at wider space</l>
            <l n="23.828">Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.</l>
            <l n="23.829">Now to the grasp each manly body bends;</l>
            <l n="23.830">The humid sweat from every pore descends;</l>
            <l n="23.831">Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs,</l>
            <l n="23.832">Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.</l>
            <l n="23.833">Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,</l>
            <l n="23.834">O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;</l>
            <l n="23.835">Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow</l>
            <l n="23.836">The watchful caution of his artful foe.</l>
            <l n="23.837">While the long strife e'en tir'd the lookers on,</l>
            <l n="23.838">Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:</l>
            <l n="23.839">‘Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:</l>
            <l n="23.840">‘Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.841">He said: and, straining, heav'd him off the ground</l>
            <l n="23.842">With matchless strength: that time Ulysses found</l>
            <l n="23.843">The strength t' evade, and where the nerves combine</l>
            <l n="23.844">His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;</l>
            <l n="23.845">Ulysses following, on his bosom lies;</l>
            <l n="23.846">Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.</l>
            <l n="23.847">Ajax to lift, Ulysses next essays,</l>
            <l n="23.848">He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise;</l>
            <l n="23.849">His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;</l>
            <l n="23.850">And, grappling close, they tumble side by side.<ref n="421.9">9</ref></l>
            <l n="23.851">Defiled with honourable dust, they roll,</l>
            <l n="23.852">Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:</l>
            <l n="23.853">Again they rage, again to combat rise;</l>
            <l n="23.854">When great Achilles thus divides the prize:</l>

</lg>
          <lg>
<l n="23.855">‘Your noble vigour, oh my friends, restrain;</l>
            <l n="23.856">‘Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.</l>
            <l n="23.857">‘Ye both have won: let others who excel,</l>
            <l n="23.858">‘Now prove that prowess you have proved so well.’</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.859">The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,</l>
            <l n="23.860">From their tir'd bodies wipe the dust away,</l>
            <l n="23.861">And, cloth'd anew, the following games survey.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.862">And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace</l>
            <l n="23.863">The youths contending in the rapid race:</l>
            <pb n="422"/>
            <l n="23.864">A silver urn that full six measures held,</l>
            <l n="23.865">By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:</l>
            <l n="23.866">Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,</l>
            <l n="23.867">Elaborate, with artifice divine;</l>
            <l n="23.868">Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,</l>
            <l n="23.869">And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:</l>
            <l n="23.870">From him descended, good Eunæus heir'd</l>
            <l n="23.871">The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spar'd,</l>
            <l n="23.872">To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward.</l>
            <l n="23.873">Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,</l>
            <l n="23.874">It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.</l>
            <l n="23.875">A well-fed ox was for the second plac'd;</l>
            <l n="23.876">And half a talent must content the last.</l>
            <l n="23.877">Achilles rising then bespoke the train:</l>
            <l n="23.878">‘Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,</l>
            <l n="23.879">‘Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.’</l>

</lg>
          <lg>
<l n="23.880">The hero said, and, starting from his place,</l>
            <l n="23.881">Oïlean Ajax rises to the race;</l>
            <l n="23.882">Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd</l>
            <l n="23.883">His youthful equals, Nestor's son the last.</l>
            <l n="23.884">Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;</l>
            <l n="23.885">Pelides points the barrier with his hand:</l>
            <l n="23.886">All start at once; Oïleus led the race;</l>
            <l n="23.887">The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace:</l>
            <l n="23.888">Behind him, diligently close, he sped,</l>
            <l n="23.889">As closely following as the running thread</l>
            <l n="23.890">The spindle follows, and displays the charms</l>
            <l n="23.891">Of the fair spinster's breast, and moving arms:</l>
            <l n="23.892">Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,</l>
            <l n="23.893">And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise:</l>
            <l n="23.894">His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays;</l>

            <l n="23.901">And, present at his thought, descends the maid.</l>
            <l n="23.902">Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,</l>
            <l n="23.903">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</l>
            <l n="23.904">All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,</l>

            <l n="23.911">Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay:</l>
            <l n="23.912">The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shar'd,</l>
            <l n="23.913">And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.</l>
            <l n="23.914">Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,</l>
            <l n="23.915">The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:</l>

<lg>
<l n="23.916">‘Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;</l>
            <l n="23.917">‘A mortal I, a goddess was my foe:</l>

<l n="23.920">Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;</l>
            <l n="23.921">A burst of laughter echo'd through the shore.</l>
            <l n="23.922">Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,</l>
            <l n="23.923">Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l n="23.924">‘Why with our wiser elders should we strive?</l>
            <l n="23.925">‘The gods still love them, and they always thrive.</l>
            <l n="23.926">‘Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize;</l>
            <l n="23.927">‘He to Ulysses, still more ag'd and wise;</l>

          </ab>
          <p>The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter sends Thetis to Achilles to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris to Priam, to encourage him to go in person, and treat for it. The old king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the charge of Idæus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young man, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation on the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his feet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with compassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and the next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out to meet him. The lamentation of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the solemnities of the funeral.</p>
          <p>The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of Hector lies in the tent of Achilles. And as many more are spent in the truce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles's camp, and partly in Troy.</p>

          <p>WE have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles, and the terrible effects of it, at an end: as that only was the subject of the poem, and the nature of Epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war, it may perhaps be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in this poem, after the conclusion of it.</p>
          <p>I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector, by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are described by Virgil in the second book of the Æneis.</p>
          <p>Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, book xxii.</p>
          <p>The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.</p>
          <p>Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself through indignation.</p>
          <p>Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deïphobus his brother, and at the taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to Menelaus, her first husband, who received her again into favour.</p>
          <p>Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ægisthus, at the instigation of Clytæmnestra, his wife, who in his absence had dishonoured his bed with Ægisthus.</p>
          <p>Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and scarce escaped with life from his adulterous wife Ægiale; but at last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is uncertain how he died.</p>
          <p>Nestor lived in peace, with his children, in Pylos, his native country.</p>
          <p>Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's Odyssey.</p>
          <p>I must end these notes by discharging my duty to two of my friends, which is the more an indispensable piece of justice, as the one of them is since dead. The merit of their kindness to me will appear infinitely the greater, as the task they undertook was, in its own nature, of much more labour, than either pleasure or reputation. The larger part of the extracts from Eustathius, together with several excellent observations, were sent me by Mr Broome: and the whole Essay upon Homer was written, upon such memoirs as I had collected, by the late Dr. Parnell,
<pb n="451"/>
Archdeacon of Clogher in Ireland. How very much that gentleman's friendship prevailed over his genius, in detaining a writer of his spirit in the drudgery of removing the rubbish of past pedants, will soon appear to the world, when they shall see those beautiful pieces of poetry, the publication of which he left to my charge, almost with his dying breath.</p>
          <p>For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave at the end of my work; and from embarrassing myself, or others, with any defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it (which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country; one who has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer; and one who (I am sure) sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it; and to have the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of</p>

        <note type="footnote" n="428.1">1 Shame, as Cowper gives it, is “man's blessing or his curse;” “his blessing,” says his note on the passage, “if he is properly influenced by it; his curse in its consequences, if he is deaf to its dictates.” Hesiod borrows Homer's words in his Works and Days, B. i. 316.</note><note type="footnote" n="429.2">2 The original is, “a sable veil.”</note><note type="footnote" n="430.3">3 <quote xml:lang="eng">Yet love is good, And woman grief's best cure.</quote> Cowper. The sentiment, as put into the mouth of Thetis in an address to her son, has given occasion for much remark. Eustathius, and some other critics, were inclined to think that this part of the speech must be spurious. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Plutarch, and Madame Dacier consider the freedom of manners and language among the ancients a sufficient inducement for us to regard it as genuine.</note><note type="footnote" n="434.4">4 It is necessary to observe that two cars are here prepared; the one drawn by mules, to carry the presents, and to bring back the body of Hector: the other drawn by horses, in which the herald and Priam rode.</note><note type="footnote" n="435.5">5 A word signifying “Black.”</note><note type="footnote" n="435.FF2">FF 2</note><note type="footnote" n="446.6">6 The Scæan gate, B. iii. 333.</note><note type="footnote" n="447.7">7 Pope should have said, as Wakefield observes, <quote xml:lang="eng">In fight his fury never spar'd a foe.</quote></note><note type="footnote" n="448.8">8 In order to make this a true reckoning, we must suppose that it cost ten years to assemble the powers of Greece, which, added to the ten years of the siege, will complete the number.
