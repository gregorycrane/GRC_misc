<head>INTRODUCTORY ESSAY ON THE LANGUAGE OF SOPHOCLES.</head>
<p>
The language of the Greek writers of the fifth century в. с. ехhibits
a degree of variety, which contrasts equally with the uniformity
of Epic poetry and the comparative sameness of Xenophon and the
Athenian orators. In no period of any literature do there exist so
many linguistic differences between writers who were almost contemporary.
These are not simply matters of dialect, and are not
adequately described as peculiarities of style. They appear also in
a tentative use of words and grammatical constructions which could
only have been allowed even to great original writers in a comparatively
early stage of literature. They are characteristic of the time
when the most copious and plastic of Western tongues was growing
into new forms under a manifold creative impulse, given by minds
possessed of extraordinary genius and stimulated to intense activity
by changes of national and political life. A wider experience than
had found utterance in the recitations of the rhapsodists, or in the
simpler tones of the earlier lyric and gnomic poetry, and the growth
of reflection, giving at once more concentration to thought and also
the power of analysing it, required new vehicles of expression. And
the first attempt to frame these in the different kinds of Greek literature
led to many novelties of language, some of which did not permanently
retain their hold. Each writer had his own tendencies,
resulting in anomalies peculiar to him and in an undeveloped but
active state both of speech and thought, these licences passed unquestioned
and easily found acceptance.
</p>

<p>
The limits of such divergence were not yet determined by grammatical
rules. The race that gave grammar to Europe were by this
time not unconscious of the complex structure of their language<note n="1">See the Preface to this edition.</note>, but
this consciousness was still indefinite, and was rather an incentive than



<pb n="2"/>

a hindrance to invention. It is not easy for us, who often speak as
well as write 'like a book,' to imagine what the art of composition
must be in such a period of transition, when every considerable writer
is a creative artist, and moulds the materials of common speech and
early literature to his purpose according to the bent of his individual
genius.
</p><p>
The age of Dante or of Luther occurs once only in the life or history
of a language. The poetic faculty does, indeed, whenever it appears,
exercise a sensible influence in re-creating or modifying the speech
through which the poet works, and such a subtle master as Virgil or
Goethe, or our own Shelley, will even at a late period produce new
combinations, though commonly without violating the established
usage, now fixed by a much longer tradition. But the working of the
creative force in the adult state of literature gives no adequate conception
of the power with which the same spirit operates in a time of
transition, when the old materials are partially fused, and re-cast in
other forms. At such moments the original instinct of language,
which is never quite dormant, bursts forth with new energy, giving
rise to phenomena which are intermediate between the first formation
of language and a grammatical rule.
</p><p>
It is of some assistance to the English student of this subject to
think of the second or Elizabethan stage of English literature, when
the comparatively unreflecting art of Chaucer's age was succeeded by
another style to which the revival of literature, last felt in England,
and the influence of the Reformation had given birth. New thoughts
craved new expression, and the stream of utterance was quickened
and disturbed by the influx of ideas. Hence arose peculiarities and
diversities of language. Great liveliness and subtlety appear together
with a certain want of accuracy. Shakespeare often throws words
together in a way that would be impossible now, and it may seem no
less strange that Spenser and Shakespeare should have been writing
at the same time in England, than that Herodotus and Sophocles, or
Sophocles and Euripides, should have been contemporary Greeks.
In making this comparison, however, it must be borne in mind that
logical analogies are more powerful in Greek than in English.
simplicity of ancient art extends also to grammar and diction.
</p><p>
The period of expansion and growth in the Greek language began
before Simonides, and the last phase of the process (which, however,
can nowhere be regarded as complete) appears in the refinements of
Plato. The disturbing influence is least visible in the transparent
style of Herodotus, who retains in the new form of prose much of the
equability and stateliness of Epic narrative. Though contemporary
with Sophocles, he in fact represents an intermediate era, that of the
somewhat stationary and complacent civilization of the Ionic cities,
which was continued after their political independence was impaired.
He preserves, even more largely than the Epic poets did, the <term>paratactic</term>
structure, or parallelism, which belongs to a very early phase of syntax.
This and other archaic traces in him may be partly due to the oral
character of his materials and partly to the logographers who preceded
him. His work is the conclusion of a period of continuous growth
<pb n="3"/>


amongst the Eastern settlements of the Hellenic race; and while the
study of him throws much light both on the language and ideas of
Attic tragedy, it is a light that falls on them from behind.
</p><p>
But on the western side of the Aegean there had arisen from the
beginning of the century, partly under the influence of the colonies
acting on the mother states, a series of writers who used language
more artificially, chief amongst whom were Pindar in lyric poetry,
Aeschylus and Sophocles in tragedy, and Thucydides the historian.
Their art was tentative and irregular, often deserting conventionality
with great boldness, and yet straitened by the exigencies of a new
endeavour. Under many different forms of ingenuity and refinement,
or of abruptness and condensation, we recognise in all of them the
struggling of the same creative effort. The tragedians worked under
conditions peculiar to themselves, and have a certain external community
of character. There grew up, as was natural, a sort of common
dialect amongst those who were writing the same species of poetry for
the same audience. Yet even amongst the tragic writers the variety
is at least as remarkable as the resemblance. There are differences
in their mode of using grammatical constructions and in their choice of
words, besides marked differences of style, which can be traced even
in the fragments. There is nothing in tragedy like the uniformity of
Epic diction. The Epic commonplace is parallel to the rhetorical
monotony of later writers.<note n="1">With the gradual adaptation of language
to the drama may be compared the
first use of language by the fathers of
Greek philosophy, which is also a sort of
experiment, and, like the language of
tragedy, is intermediate between poetry
and prose.</note>

</p><p>
In order to a complete handling of this subject it would be necessary
to consider in the first place the general characteristics of the
language of Greek tragedy; distinguishing (1) its relation to the Epic
dialect and to the language of Herodotus, (2) the infusion of gnomic
and (3) of lyric elements which it contains, (4) the traces of vernacular
conversational idiom to be inferred from the comparison of Thucydides,
the early orators, and the old Comedy, (5) the effects of the
effort towards concentration, observable especially in the frequent use
of abstract for concrete, of the cognate accusative, of cases without
prepositions, and of the poetical plural.<note n="2">Not much light is to be obtained
from the remaining fragments of the predecessors
of Aeschylus. It is permissible,
however, to conjecture that Choerilus had
set the example of using rugged metaphor,
while Phrynichus had the melodious smoothness
which old-fashioned lovers of poetry
in the time of Aristophanes attributed to
him, but that in other respects the early
dramatists departed little from the simplicity
of gnomic verse. On the other
hand, of the contemporaries of Sophocles,
Achaeus of Eretria seems to have delighted
in forced and obscure expressions, and Ion
of Chios, as we can partly judge even
from the few lines of his poetry which
remain, indulged like Sophocles, though in
a feebler manner, in experiments of diction.</note>
</p><p>
The scope of the following pages is more limited. I have endeavoured
to collect into one view some of the chief idioms which occur
in Sophocles, including those which have given most trouble to the



<pb n="4"/>


commentators; and I have arranged them under heads, the greater
number of which would be found equally applicable to other Greek
authors, especially to the Attic authors of the same period. It would
be absurd to represent Sophocles as an eccentric writer. But he made
subtle use of a material full of subtlety, which was plastic to his touch,
and the resulting lines are more difficult to trace than those which
have been impressed by some generally accepted mould.
</p><p>
An obstacle to right interpretation is removed when it is once for all
acknowledged that canons, however useful, cannot be strictly applicable
to language that is still in process of natural growth, and in which
primitive naïveté may be looked for side by side with novel abstractions
and modes of thought.

<head>PART I.- GRAMMAR.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="intro">

<p>In attempting to describe the linguistic peculiarities of Sophocles,
I propose to consider, first, grammatical constructions; and secondly,
the use of words: and shall begin by characterising the structural
peculiarities of the Greek language in general, during the transitional
period of which I have already spoken.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
<p>In the writers of this period the power of reflecting on language
appears rather as a subtle perception of analogies than as a rule of
grammar. The mind is feeling after a limit which is not yet clearly
prescribed. The genius of logic, inherent in the Greek language
from the first, is awakened into fresh activity and has a transforming
power over style. The forms of antithesis and inference already begin
to complicate expression, and to react on thought, which becomes
more self-conscious and less direct and simple.
</p><p>
In this process, which was part of the more general transition from
poetry to prose, something was probably due to the change which
began some generations earlier, but was still hardly completed, from
the habit of oral to that of written composition. The author, who now
sat pen in hand with the written page before him, must have become
increasingly conscious of analogies of language and modes of thought.
This generalized consciousness would be felt and used by him as a
new power. Although the ultimate effect of a written literature is to
induce a still greater fixity, yet by breaking in upon the conventional
sameness of oral composition, the use of writing for a time combined
with other causes to bring in a new kind of variety and individuality in
the treatment of language. The working of this reflective and logical
inventiveness appears chiefly in the opposite forms of analysis and
concentration.
</p><p>
The increasing frequency of needlessly minute distinctions, belonging
rather to the language than to the thought, the fondness for interrogative
and negative expressions, the antithetical structure of whole
paragraphs, the perpetual use of the forms of hypothesis, antithesis,
and inference, are evidences of the analytical tendency.
</p>

<p><pb n="5"/>

The effort of concentration appears in the more complex structure
of sentences, and their connection with one another, and in some
forms of inference, as well as in the condensation of words and phrases.
This concentrating energy seems generally to accompany the poetic
instinct in a reflective age, and is a common source of obscurity in
the highest literature. For obvious reasons, it has a peculiarly fitting
sphere for its operation in the language of tragedy.
</p><p>
A lesser effect of this tendency to reflect on language is the constant
attempt to vary and extend the range of idioms, which, ceasing
to be used instinctively, are caught up by the fancy of the mind and
carried by a sort of metaphor into new applications. The sentences <gloss>are not made, but grow.</gloss> General analogies often prevail over
particular uses, and often two currents of logical association meet
in one. Hence arise double constructions, changes of construction,
and what may be called feeble or imperfect constructions, the government
of one word by another being often suggested rather than
actually determined. Where language has been fully developed, as in
the studied periods of Cicero, the beginning of a sentence is always
waiting for the end: the design of the whole is prior to the execution
of the parts. But in the stage of language we are considering, the
order and coherence of words and clauses are natural rather than
grammatical. The meaning breaks upon us as we go along: the
antecedent does not <gloss>trammel up the consequence,</gloss> but the apodosis
is continually modified by the interference of some intervening word.
These are the peculiarities rather than the common characteristicswhich
appear with increasing frequency from Homer downwards-the
exception, not the rule. It is not of course meant that all the uses of words
and constructions in Sophocles or the greater part of them exhibit these
qualities, but that there is sufficient to enable us clearly to distinguish
between the style of Lucian or Xenophon and that of Sophocles.
</p><p>
The acknowledgment of such an unfixed and growing condition of
language may be thought to introduce unnecessarily into the study of
Greek syntax an element of uncertainty. And it must be admitted
that the attempt to trace constructions beyond grammatical rules is
one which may easily degenerate into fanciful subtleties. The study
of these varying analogies is more difficult than the ascertainment of
a fixed rule, just as curvilinear is more difficult than rectilinear
measurement, or as motion is harder to calculate than position. But
without attempting in some way to determine the nature of their
language, apart from the definitions of a later age, the writers of the
transition period can never be thoroughly understood. To require in
Sophocles or Thucydides the exact articulation of perfectly grammatical
writing would be no less mistaken than to interpret a speech
in Coriolanus or Cymbeline as if it were a paragraph of Pope or
Johnson. Many conjectural emendations which have been invented
to satisfy this unreasonable requirement are found, when rightly
weighed, to disturb the real harmony of the composition.
</p><p>
The grammatical consciousness is ever becoming more precise and
imposing narrower limits on the use of language. A modern English
writer could hardly confuse the singular and plural verb, as was done
<pb n="6"/>

continually in the time of Shakespeare<note n="1">It makes no difference that the plural
form in s was derived from the Northern
English dialect. The confusion existed,
and the necessity of clearing it determined
the later usage.</note>; nor pass from the second
person to the third, nor put 'who' in the objective case, nor omit the
nominative, nor interchange the transitive and intransitive verb, nor
with the same freedom employ a noun or adverb as a verb, or a verb
as a noun,<note n="2">For other instances of Elizabethan
freedom, see Mr. Abbott's <title>Shakspearian
Grammar</title>.</note> nor speak with Milton of the <gloss>unexpressive nuptial song.</gloss>
Even Shelley is hardly permitted, except by his latest editor, to use
<quote>loved more</quote> as an equivalent for <quote>felt more love</quote> so as to <quote>include
or involve a noun in its cognate verb</quote> (Forman's Shelley, vol. ii.
p. 270). Nor could the cultivated Greek of the time of Dionysius,
Plutarch, or Longinus, have endured in a contemporary the apparent
solecisms which they were quick to observe in Thucydides and other
writers of the earlier age. On the other hand, the anomalies of the
ante-grammatical writers have an important relation to the abstractions
of grammar. They are the symptoms of the first stage of the reflective
process which gradually made such experiments impossible,
just as the tentative reasonings and even the fallacies of the early
philosophers, which could have no existence after the Organon was
written, were the necessary antecedents of the Organon.
</p><p>
In Grammar, as in other sciences, the generalizations and distinctions
which have been adopted often prove inadequate to the subtlety
of the process to be analysed. They are sufficiently applicable to
the state of language which they help to perpetuate, though even
here they cannot stop the flow of change, but have a less definite
relation to the fluctuating analogies of the period in which grammatical
structure is a growing framework not yet finally set. The
regular grammarian is apt to be baffled or misled in applying his
principles to the interpretation of a writer like Thucydides or
Sophocles. Yet their so-called irregularities, arising as they do out
of the same instinct from which the regular and acknowledged forms
of the language have taken their rise, must admit of at least approximate
explanation. And there are two ways in which the validity of
such a process may be tested: (1) the study of the history of constructions,
giving the key to some analogies which the later classification
has tended to obscure: (2) if at first sight the method of such
interpretation may seem sceptical and fanciful, it is not therefore to be
rejected, if supported by a sufficient number of instances either from the
same writer or from others. The mere number of such exceptions will
prove that they are not merely capricious, but have a rule or principle
of their own. It might also tend to prevent vagueness and confusion
in such an inquiry, to distinguish between idioms current at the time
and idioms of the particular writer. This distinction, however, although
real and important, cannot be always accurately observed; partly from
our ignorance of the spoken lauguage, and partly because we often
cannot tell with certainty how much is due to the genius of a writer,
and how much to the habit of his age. In the unfixed state of the
Attic dialect, some forms or modes of expression, such as the use

<pb n="7"/>


of the article for the relative, may have been still current in common
speech which were afterwards thought to be peculiar to an Epic or
Lyric style. And there are probably others which, though passing
out of use, were familiar to the hearers of poetry, and from which the
'modern' poet occasionally selected. In the manner of such selection,
and in the modification of the selected forms, the characteristic qualities
of an author are sure to appear. This is seen chiefly in the
general colouring of the language and the choice of words, but is also
perceptible in peculiarities of grammatical structure.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
<p>Sophocles is distinguished in point of syntax from other contemporary
writers chiefly by his noble sense of harmony, and by the combination
of extreme refinement with moderation and simplicity. He
is, to borrow a phrase from Aristotle, ὁμαλῶς ἀνώμαλος : -the first
equable writer of the reflective age; for Herodotus, as already noticed,
is essentially of an earlier type. The incipient logical analysis, and
ethical and political thought, and also the love of condensation, which
have such strange effect in the intricate or knotted constructions of
Thucydides, are present in Sophocles, and are often in him a
cause of uncertainty, but never of harshness. He has neither the
ruggedness of Aeschylus, nor the strained ingenuity of Pindar. Like
all the greatest writers, he can only be partially studied by the light of
his age: he has characteristics of his own, which are best seen by
comparing him with other great masters of language in different ages.
In the absolute subordination of every tone and emphasis to the
dominant feeling, and the perfect adaptation of the language to the
degree of tenderness or sternness, of passion or coldness, which is
required by the situation, he resembles Virgil and Goethe, and
those parts of Shakespeare in which his exuberant invention is
most under control. This power of moderation adds greatly to the
effect of pathos, in which Sophocles is unsurpassed.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
<p>
The peculiarities of structure in the lyric passages of Sophocles
are not essentially different from those in the dialogue. The influence
of the earlier lyric poetry is more perceptible in them, just as reminiscences
of Homer occur chiefly in the long speeches, and especially
in narrative. But both the Epic and Lyric elements, as well as
that of common speech, are present everywhere, and are so blended
by the poet's art that any broad line of distinction would be illusory.
Even the Doric dialect, the traditional vehicle of lyric expression, is
only partially assumed, and hardly interferes with the harmony of the
general effect. In the following digest of idioms it has been thought
sufficient to denote, by the letters <gloss>lyr.</gloss> prefixed, examples taken
either from the choral odes or from other lyrical passages. We may
therefore here observe the chief particulars in which these differ from
the senarii in point of syntax. They are mostly differences of degree.
The spirit of fanciful association is more active, and more apt to
usurp the place of conventional use. The concentrating effort is
more intense, recalling in some passages the spirit of Hebrew poetry.
There is more of rapid and abrupt transition, more of substitution
<pb n="8"/>

and inversion, of redundance and deficiency. The article is often
omitted; prepositions are often added pleonastically. The stress
of lyric feeling is combined with the elevation of poetic thought. And
the language varies from great simplicity to great complexity, and
from the most perfect serenity to the most highly-wrought excitement.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.1" n="1"><head>1. CASES OF NOUNS.</head>
<p>


Comparative philology has made familiar the law of decay and
regeneration in language, by which inflexions gradually lose their
meaning and are replaced by other elements. This process is accompanied
by the tendency to analytical expression, which makes
the meaning of terminations and prefixes more explicit by the use of
auxiliary words. The history of the case-endings affords a striking
exemplification of this law. In English, as in most modern languages,
there are at most two oblique cases, the possessive and
objective, and of the latter the pronouns alone retain the inflexion.
The possessive expresses only one relation, and the objective can
hardly express more than one without leaning on a preposition.
Sanskrit has the accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative,
and ablative. The Greek language retains traces, in the locative
adverbs, of an almost equal number of cases, and each of the three
remaining cases expresses a variety of relations, which in the earlier
literature were more vividly conceived than in the more conventional
usage of later times. It would be instructive to study the gradations
of the change from Homer downwards, through the earlier and later
Attic, the common dialect and the Byzantine period, to modern Greek.
The dying vigour of the old forms would be seen to revive and grow
again from time to time. <emph>Experiments</emph> more or less conscious sprang
up and withered, before the prevailing habit was finally determined.
Opposite tendencies are seen working together: the preposition being
sometimes inserted as well as sometimes omitted unexpectedly. In
this process, as in every important modification of language, the
poetic instinct plays an active part. More conscious than other men
of implicit meanings and connections of words, the poet gives new
life to the decaying forms. All poetry abounds with novel modes
of speech, from which common language selects what is most in
accordance with prevailing tendencies and most suitable for use.
That the case-endings still retained much of their force in the old
Attic is evident from the language of Thucydides. The poet seizes
this instrument of condensed expression and strives to multiply it,
partly by reverting to earlier modes, but chiefly through analogical
and metaphorical applications. The exact intention in each instance
is not always easily determined. It was no doubt felt but could not
have been explained by a contemporary Greek.
</p><p>
Even in English, where the limits of the experiment are so narrow,
there have been similar attempts to extend the use of the cases.
Thus the remote object is often expressed without a preposition by a
second objective case which thus performs the function of a dative,
and there are many instances in the Elizabethan poets of a sort of
dativus ethicus. E. g. <quote>A' would manage you his piece thus,</quote> <quote>A good
sherris-sack ascends me into the brain,</quote> etc.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>
The question as to the origin of inflexions has little direct bearing
on the present subject. Although the theory that derives the cases
<pb n="10"/>

from relations of place is most in accordance with the analogy of
language-which seems to proceed, like the other phenomena of
thought, from without inwards, and is probably true, yet this account
of the cases, in the later state of language which is alone
known to us, affords hardly any help in determining the multifarious
and anomalous relations which in the course of ages have grown up
around them. And could it be shown that the function of each case
was in the beginning simple and definite, and not rather tentative and
vague, yet they have not reached the position in which we first find
them without many cross-influences which are hard to investigate.
Reflections from other relations, the exigencies of growing expression,
and the re-action of different uses upon each other, have woven
a sort of tangle, in which the eye can hardly follow any branch to its
origin. Hence, while the distinction between external and internal
relations may afford a principle of classification, which accords in
some degree with changes actually observed, this is not to be supposed
equivalent to the distinction between earlier and later modes in
the period under discussion. There are further differences which it
may be useful to bear in mind. In attempting to analyse the uses
which are actually found, it is important to recognize the difference
between the metaphysical analogy which has suggested certain constructions,
and the rule of usage to which they tend to conform, and,
thirdly, the generalization of them which is made by the grammarian.
And it may be observed, in passing from this part of the subject,
that many things are determined by use, quite regularly, of which no
metaphysical explanation can be given, and which can hardly be reduced
to a general principle.

    <head>THE GENITIVE.</head>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>

The genitive has two main significations, which are clearly distinguished,
although in some instances they pass into each other, the
ablative and the attributive. The former is gradually discarded, except
with prepositions, and the case more and more assumes the
character, to which it has been thought to owe the name γενική
πτῶσις, denoting the kind to which a thing belongs, and thus tending
always to express the wider of two conceptions. The connection
between the governing noun, and the noun in the genitive by which
it is included or determined, is sometimes so indefinite as to be
extremely difficult to analyse.
Common uses of the genitive are-

<list>
<item>α. Ablative. </item>
<item>α.1. <gloss>From.</gloss> </item>
<item>α.2. <gloss>Away from.</gloss></item>

It will be convenient to arrange under the above headings the
characteristic or exceptional uses of the genitive in Sophocles. It
may be observed that nearly all of them are retained in later Greek
with the support of prepositions.

no less frequent in the Tragedians than in Homer. Sophocles

lyr. and occurs in combination with a verbal noun (ἐπιστήμη).

Where a cogn. accusative would follow the active verb, the passive

Note also the cognate verb; i. e. a verb making explicit a notion
belonging to the noun-
Τr. 620. Ἑρμοῦ τήνδε πομπεύω τέχνην (πόμπιμον τ. ἐπιτηδεύω).
Εl. 406. πατρὶ τυμβεῦσαι χοάς (τυμβήρεις χ. χέαι). Aj. 1287. ἅλμα

    <head>accusative in apposition to the action</head>
<p>
The accusative in apposition to the action, i. e. governed not
by the particular verb, but by the general verbal notion, which
it is intended further to define, is also common in Greek, especially
in poetry. There are two chief cases of this idiom, corresponding
severally to a participial clause (ταῦτα ποιῶν) and to an
infinitive with ὥστε (ὥστε ταῦτα ποιεῖν).] In Sophocles this use
helps concentration, e. g.
</p><p>
Ο. Τ. 603. καὶ τῶνδ᾽ ἔλεγχον, τοῦτο μέν, κ. τ. λ. - <gloss>And for proof
of this, first of all,</gloss> etc. and is curiously applied in O. C. 1204.

The idiomatic ταῦτα (as in Ar. Nub. 319. ταῦτ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἀκούσασ᾽ αὐτῶν τὸ
φθέγμ᾽ ἡ ψυχή μου πεποτᾶται,
Ib. 353) is an example of this use.

Τr. 1062. γυνὴ δέ, θήλυς οὖσα, κοὐκ ἀνδρὸς φύσιν: i. e. the original
thought was θήλυς οὖσα φύσιν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνήρ. But φύσιν being
postponed, and the construction thus partially obscured, the sentence
is continued as if the accusative had followed an active verb
(e. g. ἔχουσα). In Aj. 760. ἀνθρώπου φύσιν βλαστών, the construction
appears to be similarly modified from ἄνθρωπος φύσιν βλ., in which
φύσιν would be the accusative of limitation. The case of φύσιν
here may therefore be explained either as the accusative of limitation
or as the cognate accusative.

<head>PREPOSITIONS.</head>
<p>


The origin of the Preposition is later and less obscure than that of
the cases; and was certainly connected with notions of place. In
ἀντί, for instance, the process can still be traced from the locative
case of a noun (cp. the French en face) of which the accusative appears
in Homer, as in the phrase εἰς ἄντα, first to an adverb of place=
ἄντην, and then to the prepositional use, which in the signification
<gloss>instead of,</gloss> passes out of the association of place.
</p><p>
As life and thought grew more complex, the variety even of local
relations became greater than could be clearly expressed by the case-endings.
Hence the preposition became more and more essential as a
part of speech: the analytical mode of expression taking the place of
the organic, or synthetical, by a process similar to that observable in the
introduction of other auxiliary words, as in the σχῆμα Χαλκιδικὸν (ἐστὶν
ἔχον, etc.) and the modern Greek substitute for the infinitive mood.
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.2.α" n="α">
<p>
Sophocles still retains the old adverbial use in a few expressions:-
</p><p>
ἐν δέ-<gloss>And there.</gloss>
O. C. 55-56. ἐν δ᾽ ὁ πυρφόρος θεὸς | Τιτὰν Προμηθεύς-<gloss>And there

Ant. 420. ἐν δ᾽ ἐμεστώθη μέγας | αἰθήρ. Εl. 713. ἐν δὲ πᾶς ἐμεστώθη

 The prepositional usage is less fixed than at a later time.
Partly the conventional mode of expression has not been finally
selected, and partly the relation to be expressed is more graphically
conceived than in after use. This may be observed also
in Herodotus, as compared, for instance, with Xenophon (Hdt. iv. 69. κατὰ μὲν ἔκαυσαν Δρύμον πόλιν, κατὰ δὲ Χαράδρην: Hdt. ii. 91. διὰ

<p>

As the case is used without the preposition quasi-elliptically, so

fulness of expression happens to be effective.
These opposite deviations arise from the same cause, viz. the comparative
liveliness and freedom of the elements of language.

The frequent use of collective neuter words, e. g. λῆμα, φθέγμα,
μίσημα, τὰ φίλτατα, for masculine and feminine, belongs properly
<pb n="30"/>

to the substitution of abstract for concrete, which will be treated
as a point of diction (see Part II). Such instances as-

The Attic preference for masculine forms may, in Sophocles,
generally be traced to some special motive. Either (a) the masculine
gender is selected as the <gloss>worthier,</gloss> as in-

    О. С. 1016-1017. οἱ μὲν ἐξηρπασμένοι | σπεύδουσιν - <gloss>The party of
the captured ones is hastening off,</gloss> i. e. the maidens and their
captors (cp.

</p><p>
    Or (2) where the more general word agrees better with the
feeling of the passage (especially where a woman speaks of
women). O. T. 1472. τοῖν μοι φίλοιν - <gloss>My dear ones.</gloss> Tr. 151.

<p>
The use of the plural for the singular is a common feature of the
tragic dialect. There is a tendency in poetry to the use of
abstract words, which are expressive of feeling, as may be often
observed in the substitution of the abstract for the concrete.
In like manner the vagueness of the plural is frequently the
expression of poetical feeling, as in the following instances:-
</p>

<p>
    O. Τ. 1403-8. ὦ γάμοι, γάμοι .. κἀπεδείξατε | πατέρας, ἀδελφούς,

<p>
Of a wholly different kind is the interchange of singular and
plural, which arises sometimes from a mere variation in the mode
of expression, the indefinite singular being equivalent to the
indefinite plural.
</p>

<p>Ant. 1021-1022. οὐδ᾽ ὄρνις εὐσήμους ἀπορροιβδεῖ βοάς, | ἀνδροφθόρου

</p>

have taken from within.</gloss>

of the same thing.

    <head>ARTICLE AND PRONOUN.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α" n="α">

<p>
As the Article is sprung from the demonstrative pronoun, and
the relative pronoun has the same origin, it is right to consider
them together, and the earliest grammarians understood this
when they included them under one name as ἄρθρα.</p>

<p>
It has been sometimes imagined, in accordance with a tradition
of Aristarchus, that the article is always pronominal in Homer,
and always, with certain fixed exceptions, merely attributive in
later Greek. But the change was gradual, and can partly be
traced. There are beginnings of the weaker or simply defining
use, even in Homer :-</p>

<p>
Il. 1. 167. σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον—<gloss>Far greater is that gift
which falls to thee.</gloss>
Il. 23. 325. ἀλλ᾽ ἔχει ἀσφαλέως καὶ τὸν
προὔχοντα δοκεύει-<gloss>But holds securely, and watches him the
foremost.</gloss>
</p>

<p><pb n="32"/>

In these and other such instances, the use is no doubt more vivid
than in later Greek; that is to say, an individual image is
presented to the mind: but we perceive in them the transition to
the usage which afterwards became fixed. On the other hand,
there are remains of the pronominal use even in the later Attic
(καὶ ὅς, ἢ δ᾽ ὅς, ἡ δ᾽ ἤ, ὁ μέν, ὁ δέ, πρὸ τοῦ, τοῦ ὁ ἔστιν, τῶν ὅσα, τὰ καὶ
τά, τὸ δ᾽ ἦν ἄρα, ἐν τοῖς πρῶτος, κ.τ.λ.). Plat. Legg. iii. 701 E. οὔτε
τοῖς, οὔτε τοῖς.
Plat. Legg. iv. 721 B. τῇ καὶ τῇ δὲ ἀτιμίᾳ.
</p>

<p>From the early Epic to the late Attic usage, there is a gradation, in
which Sophocles comes about half-way. While he employs the
article more largely as a pronoun than could have been done at
a later time, he is more sparing in the attributive or defining use,
which thus retains more graphic power than in ordinary language.
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.1" n="1">

<p>γάρ.
The article as a demonstrative is generally accompanied in
Sophocles by γάρ or δέ,


Ο. Τ. 1082. τῆς γὰρ πέφυκα μητρός-<gloss>For she is my true
mother.</gloss> Εl. 45. ὁ γὰρ | μέγιστος αὐτοῖς τυγχάνει δορυξένων-
<gloss>For he is their greatest ally.</gloss>
Phil. 154. lyг. τὸ γάρ μοι | μαθεῖν
οὐκ ἀποκαίριον-<gloss>For to learn this were not unseasonable for me.</gloss>
</p><p>δέ.
O. C. 742. ἐκ δὲ τῶν μάλιστ᾽ ἐγώ-<gloss>And of them I in chief.</gloss>
Τr. 1172. τὸ δ᾽ ἦν ἄρ᾽ οὐδὲν ἄλλο-<gloss>But, as it seems, this really
meant merely.</gloss>
Ib. 134. lyr. τῷ δ᾽ ἐπέρχεται-<gloss>And to him (or to
another) comes successively.</gloss>
</p>

<p>Ὁ δé, indefinite, occurs without ὁ μέν preceding.
Εl. 1291. ἀντλεῖ, τὰ δ᾽ ἐκχεῖ, τὰ δὲ διασπείρει μάτην-<gloss>Drains, and
part lavishes, part idly squanders.</gloss> Tr. 117. lyr. τρέφει, τὸ δ' αὔξει
<gloss>Nurtures (or surrounds), and in a manner glorifies.</gloss> Ant. 1299.
τὸν δ᾽ ἔναντα προσβλέπω νεκρόν-<gloss>And again I see before my eyes
this corpse.</gloss> This instance differs slightly from the others,
because it has a definite meaning or reference. O. T. 1228-1229.
ὅσα | κεύθει, τὰ δ᾽ αὐτίκ᾽ εἰς τὸ φῶς φανεῖ κακά. [Cp. Pind. Isthm. vi. 61. ἀπ᾿ Ἴσθμου, τὰς δ᾽ ἀπ᾿ Εὐφύλλου Νεμέας.]</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.2" n="2">

<p>
But the demonstrative use occurs also in a different connexion.
O. C. 1699. lyr. ὁπότε γε καὶ τὸν ἐν χεροῖν κατεῖχον-<gloss>What time
I kept him too in my embrace.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.3" n="3">

<p>
The article as a demonstrative is used adverbially, by a continuance
of the Homeric idiom, without the help of a particle.
Ο.Τ. 510. lyr. τῷ ἀπ᾿ ἐμᾶς φρενός - <gloss>Therefore,</gloss> etc. Phil. 142.
lyr. τό μοι ἔννεπε-<gloss>Then tell me.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.4" n="4">

<p>
The relative use of the article in tragic Greek is confined to the
cases which have at the commencement (probably to avoid the
confusion of ὁ and ὅ, ἡ and ἥ); and occurs in these, as a rule,
only where the is required to prevent hiatus. Exceptions are-
</p>

<p>O. C. 35. σκοπὸς προσήκεις τῶν ἀδηλοῦμεν φράσαι (where the
<pb n="33"/>

reading is questionable) - <gloss>Thou art come as an informant of
the things whereof we doubt, to tell us of them.</gloss> Phil. 707. lyr.
αἴρων τῶν νεμόμεσθ' | ἀνέρες ἀλφησταί <gloss>Taking up of the things
whereof we toiling men partake</gloss> (where the whole passage has
an Epic colouring).</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.5" n="5">

<p>
The transition to the common use appears in such expressions
as-
Phil. 371. ὁ δ᾽ εἶπ᾿ Ὀδυσσεύς, πλησίον γὰρ ἂν κύρει-<gloss>And he
said, Odysseus said, for he chanced to be standing near;</gloss> where
the noun is in apposition to the article, which still retains its
pronominal force. El. 601. ὁ δ᾽ ἄλλος . . . Ὀρέστης-<gloss>He too....
Orestes.</gloss> Ο. Τ. 19. τὸ δ᾽ ἄλλο φύλον-<gloss>There is another company
which,</gloss> etc.
</p>

<p>Compare the Homeric
τὸ δὲ μέγα κεῖται ἄεθλον-<gloss>And there a rich prize is set.</gloss> Il. 22. 163.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6" n="6">

<p>
To pass now to the attributive or defining use of the article :-
The defining article retains a greater liveliness, i. e. more
vestiges of the earlier demonstrative use, than in later Greek, and
even than in contemporary prose; and the limits of the usage
are less fixed.
Hence—.
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6.a" n="a">

<p>The article sometimes receives a strong emphasis. Especially remarkable
in this connexion is Ant. 409, where the article is placed at the
end of an Iambic line-
πᾶσαν κόνιν σήραντες ἡ κατεῖχε τὸν | νέκυν-<gloss>Having wiped off all
the dust which covered that corse.</gloss>
Cp.
Ib. 404. ὃν σὺ τὸν νεκρόν—<gloss>That corpse that thou,</gloss> etc.

Sophocles, like other writers, uses the article to express a general
notion, e. g.

Ib. 374. τὸ ..
ὀρθόν-<gloss>What is right.</gloss>

Ant. 721. τὸν ἄνδρα. O. C. 1127. καὶ τοὐπιεικὲς καὶ τὸ μὴ ψευδοστομεῖν. Also with epexegetic infinitives: O. T. 1417, El. 1030.

</p>
<p>

Ib. 312.
τὰ δείν' . . ἔπη- <gloss>Those terrible threats which haunt me:</gloss>

The forms του, τῳ, τοῦ, τῷ, and in Tr. 984. lyr. the dat. pl. τοῖσι; for

as inflections of ὁ, ἡ, τό, but are now known to be anomalous
cases (heteroclita) of τίς, as from a nom. τέος. In proof of this,
it may be observed that Ionic Greek has τοῦ and τέῳ, τευ and τεῳ,
in the interrogative and indefinite meaning, but never as cases of
the article.

So the adverb τῇδεO. C. 641. τῇδε γὰρ ξυνοίσομαι. Εl. 1302. καὶ τοὐμὸν ἔσται τῇδ᾽.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, ὅδε is used with pointed emphasis not only for
the first personal pronoun (O. C. 450, etc.), but as an indirect expression
for the possessive pronoun of different persons. (Cp.
These hands shall tear her, Shak. Much Ado, iv. 1).

Ant. 449. τούσδ' ὑπερβαίνειν νόμους- <gloss>To transgress our edict.</gloss>
</p>
<p>
And with a certain pathos in-</p>
<p>
Phil. 822. κάρα γὰρ ὑπτιάζεται τόδε-<gloss>For, see, his head falls
backwards.</gloss></p>

οὗτος occurs similarly without a distinct correlative.

my shaft might wound.</gloss> Ant. 668. καὶ τοῦτον ἂν τὸν ἄνδρα θαρσοίην

<p>In O. T. 1180. οὗτος . . ὅν φησιν οὗτος - <gloss>If you are he, he
says you are,</gloss> the first οὗτος is thus used, while the second is
employed in the usual way. Cp. Shak. H. VIII. i. 1. <gloss>Must fetch
him in he papers,</gloss> where there is a similar ambiguity in the two
pronouns.
</p>

<p>So τοιοῦτος.
</p>

<p>Phil. 1049. οὐ γὰρ τοιούτων δεῖ, τοιοῦτός εἰμ᾿ ἐγώ – <gloss>Where such
are needed, such am I.</gloss>
</p>

<p>And κεῖνο, Phil. 850-851. lyr. κεῖνο .... ὅπως πράξεις.
</p>
<p>
The familiar distinction between ὅδε and οὗτος is not always preserved.
They are sometimes used alternately with the same
reference, for variety and to suit the verse.

    <head>THE ADJECTIVE</head>
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
<p>

With respect to the Adjective, as well as to the case-endings, the
feeling of analogy was stronger in the age of Sophocles, and the force
of convention weaker, than at a later time; and he is able to extend
adjectival uses, from the same instinctive consciousness of the
meaning of inflexions to which the extension of the case-idioms is
also due. And speaking generally, the adjective is used by him (as
by earlier writers) with greater freedom than in ordinary Attic Greek.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.5.α" n="α">
<p>One obvious peculiarity which he shares with the other Tragic
poets is the tendency to redouble epithets, often without any
connecting particle; e. g.
</p>
<p>
Εl. 1085. lyr. πάγκλαυτον αἰῶνα κοινὸν εἶλου-<gloss>You chose to share
with many the tearful life.</gloss>
Ib. 851. lyr. πανσύρτῳ παμμήνῳ . . δεινῶν
στυγνῶν τ᾽ ἀχέων † αἰῶνι -<gloss>A life crowded in every month with
fearful and hateful sorrows.</gloss> Ant. 891. ὦ κατασκαφής | οἴκησις

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.5.β" n="β">
<p>
The rule that the article or other determinative word should
immediately precede an adjective when used attributively is apparently
broken, by an epithet being introduced after a noun to
which (1) the article or (2) an interjection has been attached. The
adjective in this case may be regarded as placed in apposition to
the noun, and as conveying an implied predication. It will be
observed that in several instances there is a possessive pronoun
preceding the noun.</p>

<head>THE ADVERB.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α" n="α">
<p>The Adverb, like the preposition, to which it is allied (see above,
p. 26, § 18), is sometimes made to bear an unusual emphasis or
stress of meaning; e. g.
</p>
<p>
Ο. Τ. 608. γνώμῃ δ᾽ ἀδήλῳ μή με χωρὶς αἰτιῶ-<gloss>But do not on
a vague surmise accuse me apart,</gloss> i. e. without the proofs indicated

happiness indeed.</gloss> Ant. 70. ἐμοῦ γ᾽ ἂν ἡδέως δρῴης μέτα - <gloss>Would

ἴσως | ὡς ἐξεπλήσθη-<gloss>In equal virulence as it sated itself before.</gloss>
Ant. 1069. ψυχήν τ᾿ ἀτίμως ἐν τάφῳ κατώκισας-<gloss>And hast dishonoured
by entombment a living soul.</gloss> O. C. 428. οὕτως
ἀτίμως πατρίδος ἐξωθούμενον- <gloss>So dishonoured with banishment.</gloss></p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α.1" n="1">
<p>
By this means the adverb is brought into relation with the whole
clause rather than with any particular word.
</p>
<p>
Ο. Τ. 675. αὑταῖς δικαίως εἰσὶν ἄλγισται φέρειν <gloss>With justice
are hardest to themselves to bear.</gloss> Aj. 183-5. lyr. οὔποτε γὰρ

Partly from the frequent retention of a verbal meaning in the
noun, an adverb is sometimes found modifying not a verb or
sentence, but a single substantive. In the case of ἄλλως this
happens in various Greek writers, as well as in-

An interesting feature of Greek syntax is the frequent transference
of adverbs of place to denote time, occasion, circumstance,

logical sequence. The following instances of this are noticeable:-</p>

In speaking of Particles we may notice a few of the more characteristic
subtilties of expression, leaving other peculiarities to be observed
in the notes (e. g. μέν without δέ, Τr. 457, Εl. 61, postponement of Te,

As an adverb, marking the correspondence of ideas, has often
a simply emphatic force, especially after interrogatives, relatives,
and words of comparison, where καί expresses every degree of
emphasis, from the strongest to the slightest. (Cp. Hdt. iv. 99.

σώσατε. Aj. 917. οὐδεὶς ἄν, ὅστις καὶ φίλος No one who loved
the man.' An enemy would gladly gaze on his wounds, an indifferent
person would not mind seeing them, but a friend could
not look at them.)

ὡς with the accusative absolute and participle differs from the

<head>Uses of μή.</head>
<p>

μή, originally the prohibitive particle, is adapted in Greek, through
various uses, to express purpose, hypothesis, general or abstract
notions, and also negations that are viewed not merely
as facts, but as determinations of volition, feeling, or thought.
Extensions of the use of μή in Sophocles arise partly from his
love of refining on language; and partly from the tendency to
more abstract modes of expression. A few points are deserving
of special notice.

<p>The tendency to make an implied negative explicit is a common
feature of Greek syntax. Negative expressions are apt to be
unduly emphasized in consequence of some latent consciousness

Another form of this phenomenon is the use of μὴ οὐ with infinitives and participles.
</p>
<p>

The pleonastic oὐ in this and similar idioms (οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ, Hdt. iv. 118, Hdt. v. 94, Hdt. vii. 16 § 3, Thuc. ii. 62: πρὶν δ᾽ οὐδὲν ὀρθῶς
εἰδέναι, τί κ.τ.λ. Eur. Hel. 322) is caused by the difficulty of
holding two negatives at once (or a negative with an interrogative
or comparative) distinctly before the mind.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.7.η.3.a" n="a">
<p>
Where a negative or privative notion has been negatived, and
is further explained, μὴ οὐ is used with an epexegetic infinitive or
participle; especially when the chief negation refers to circumstances
actually present. [Plat. Rep. i. 354 B. οὐκ ἀπεσχόμην
τὸ μὴ οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἐλθεῖν.]
</p>
<p>

Τr. 90. νῦν δ᾽, ὡς ξυνίημ᾽, οὐδὲν ἐλλείψω τὸ μὴ οὐ | πᾶσαν πυθέσθαι
τῶνδ᾽ ἀλήθειαν πέρι. O. C. 359-360. ἥκεις γὰρ οὐ κενή γε, τοῦτ᾽ ἐγὼ
σαφῶς | ἔξοιδα, μὴ οὐχὶ δεῖμ᾽ ἐμοὶ φέρουσά τι-<gloss>I know you come not
empty, or without some dreadful news for me.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

An interrogative takes the place of the chief negative :-
Aj. 540. τί δῆτα μέλλει μὴ οὐ παρουσίαν ἔχειν;
</p>
<p>

In the above instances the circumstances of the negation are actual
and present: but in others, where the case is hypothetical, or
actual but remote in time, μή alone is used.
</p>
<p>

Ο. Τ. 1387. οὐκ ἂν ἐσχόμην | τὸ μὴ ᾿ποκλῇσαι τοὐμὸν ἄθλιον δέμας.
Phil. 348-349. οὐ πολὺν | χρόνον μ᾽ ἐπέσχον μή με ναυστολεῖν ταχύ.

introduced by ἐάν τις λέγῃ, has the effect of excluding οὐ.]

<p>A special case of the last mentioned idiom (μὴ οὐ giving a negative
condition of a negative statement) occurs, where a supposed
course of action is deprecated, or marked as blameworthy. In
this connexion the infinitive is more frequent, but the participle
is also used.
[Plato, Prot. 352 D. αἰσχρόν ἐστι καὶ ἐμοὶ ... μὴ

δυσαλγήτου ἀνδρός ἐστι τὸ μὴ οὐ κατοικτείρειν τοιάνδε ἔδραν.
</p>
<p>

Here, as in the examples under a, the circumstances of the negation
(δυσάλγητος=οὐκ εὐτρεπὴς πρὸς τὸ ἀλγῆσαι) are present and
actual (τοιάνδε ἔδραν); but in Ο. Τ. 76-77. ὅταν δ᾽ ἵκηται, τηνικαῦτ᾽
ἐγὼ κακὸς | μὴ δρῶν ἂν εἴην πάνθ' ὅσ᾽ ἂν δηλοῖ θεός, they are prospective
and contingent, and οὐκ is excluded; as also in O. T. 1457.
μὴ ἐπί τῳ δεινῷ κακῷ (σωθείς), where they are remote in time.

[An imaginary example may help to illustrate μὴ οὐ κατοικτείρων in
O. T. 13. Suppose that to Aj. 1330. ἢ γὰρ εἴην οὐκ ἂν εὖ φρονῶν
a negative clause expressive of the ground or condition of this
statement had been added, μὴ οὐ would have been in place.

With respect to interrogative particles it is enough to mention that
the long apa is sometimes equivalent to ἆρ' οὐ, or rather expresses
a stronger certainty. This may be explained by supposing an
ironical or indignant suppression of the negative, as unnecessary
in so clear a case. Cp. the English, <gloss>Is it so, or is it not?</gloss> which
implies a more vehement asseveration than <gloss>Is it not so?</gloss>

<p>

Ο. Τ. 822. ἆρ᾽ ἔφυν κακός; | ἆρ᾽ οὐχὶ πᾶς ἄναγνος-<gloss>Am I then
a wretch? Am I not altogether unholy?</gloss>
Here the negative is omitted, until the chief stress of the emphasis
is past. A different tone of irony appears in-
Εl. 790. ἆρ᾽ ἔχει καλῶς ;
Ib. 816. ἆρά μοι καλῶς ἔχει;
ἆρα μή expresses an ironical doubt.
El. 446. ἆρα μὴ δοκεῖς; Ant. 632. ἆρα μὴ ... πατρὶ λυσσαίνων πάρει;
ἆρα occurs also in strong assertions where there is no reason for
supposing even an implied question.

that will some day be a grief to the Cadmeans.</gloss>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1.a" n="a">

<p>
There is a peculiar use of the active participle neuter, which
occurs in Sophocles and some contemporary writers, though not
at all in earlier, and rarely in later Greek.
</p>
<p>

A state of the person, generally mental, is expressed by the
neuter participle with the article, which thus becomes a sort of
subject; e.g. Thuc. i. 36. τὸ μὲν δεδιὸς αὐτοῦ : Thuc. iii. 9. ἐν γὰρ τῷ διαλλάσσοντι τῆς γνώμης καὶ αἱ διαφοραὶ τῶν ἔργων καθίστανται : Thuc. v. 9. τοῦ
μένοντος (<gloss>the determination to stand firm</gloss>) : Thuc. vi. 24. τὸ μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦν τοῦ πλοῦ : Thuc.  vii. 68. ἀποπλῆσαι τῆς γνώμης τὸ θυμούμενον.
</p>
<p>

This idiom arises partly from the difficulty of finding expressions
for mental phenomena, and partly from the tendency to express
feelings as states of emotion, and hence to employ the verb
rather than the noun. The only continuance of this use in later
Greek is in such philosophical terms as τὸ αἰσθανόμενον, τὸ ὀρεγόμενον, τὸ νοοῦν, τὸ ἡγούμενον, τὸ προαιρούμενον, τὸ συνειδός.
</p>
<p>

The Sophoclean examples are-
</p>
<p>

O. C. 1219 lyr. ὅταν τις ἐς πλέον πέσῃ τοῦ θέλοντος-see note in
loco. Phil. 674-675. τὸ γὰρ | νοσοῦν ποθεῖ σε συμπαραστάτην λαβεῖν
<gloss>For my diseased state longs to obtain thee as a supporter.</gloss>
Τr. 196. τὸ γὰρ ποθοῦν ἕκαστος ἐκμαθεῖν θέλων - <gloss>For each wishing
to feed with information his particular craving;</gloss> τὸ ποθοῦν, that
which is <gloss>beating in the mind.</gloss> (Shak. Temp. i. 2.) In this last
example the feeling and its object are identified.
</p>
<p>

In the following instances the action is similarly identified with the
agent or subject, although a state is not described.
</p>
<p>

O. C. 266-267. ἐπεὶ τὰ γ᾽ ἔργα μου | πεπονθότ᾽ ἐστὶ μᾶλλον ἢ δεδρακότα
<gloss>Since for my actions, they have more in them of suffering
than of doing.</gloss>
Ib. 1604-1605. ἐπεὶ δὲ παντὸς εἶχε δρῶντος ἡδονὴν |
κοὐκ ἦν ἔτ᾽ οὐδὲν ἀργὸν ὧν ἐφίετο-<gloss>And when he had satisfaction
in seeing everything in act, and no part of his commands was
any longer idle.</gloss> (Cp. Aesch. Prom. 57. οὐ ματᾷ τοὔργον τόδε.)
O. C. 74. ὅσ᾽ ἂν λέγωμεν, πάνθ' ὁρῶντα λέξομεν -<gloss>All that I utter
shall be full of sight.</gloss>
</p>

<p>It is noticeable that five of the six instances (which are all that
occur) belong to the latest period of Sophocles, which is most
nearly contemporary with the work of Thucydides.

<p>
The absolute or otherwise intransitive use of active verbs will be
considered as a point of diction (in Part II). But the following
rare actives deserve notice here :-ἄζονθ' (O. C. 134), μηχανᾶν

</p>
<p>
 The middle forms of ὁράω and εἶδον are retained by Sophocles,
partly in continuation of Epic usage, but also with a degree of
<term>ethical</term> or <term>pathetic</term> meaning.
</p>
<p>

O. C. 244. lyr. οὐκ ἀλαοῖς προσορωμένα ὄμμα σὸν ὄμμασιν-<gloss>Looking
in thine eyes with eyes of mine that are not blind.</gloss> Cp.
infr. d. Tr. 908-909. εἴ του φίλων βλέψειεν οἰκετῶν δέμας | ἔκλαιεν ἡ
δύστηνος εἰσορωμένη-<gloss>If she might see the form of any one of
her dear domestics, she wept, unhappy woman, as her eye
beheld them.</gloss> Ant. 593. lyr. ἀρχαῖα τὰ Λαβδακιδῶν | οἴκων ὁρῶμαι,
κ.τ.λ.-<gloss>From of old I see with pain the calamities of the
house of the Labdacidae.</gloss> Ο. Τ. 1217-1218. lyr. εἴθε σ' εἴθε * σε
| μήποτ᾽ εἰδόμαν -<gloss>Would that I had never had the unhappiness of
seeing thee!</gloss> Phil. 351. ὅπως ἴδοιμ᾽ ἄθαπτον· οὐ γὰρ εἰδόμην -

<pb n="53"/>


<gloss>That I might see him ere he was buried, for my eyes had not
seen him.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

In the following examples the reflexive meaning of the voice is
more distinct-
</p>
<p>

Ant. 713. κλῶνας ὡς ἐκσώζεται -<gloss>How they save their twigs.</gloss>
Aj. 43. χεῖρα χραίνεσθαι φόνῳ - <gloss>That he imbrues his hand in
blood.</gloss> O. T. 1487. νοούμενος τὰ λοιπὰ τοῦ πικροῦ βίου. Aj. 511.
σοῦ διοίσεται μόνος, (διοίσει τὸν ἑαυτοῦ βίον.) Τr. 103. ποθουμένᾳ ..
φρενί (unless this is passive, as from a causative use=<gloss>laden with
regret.</gloss>) Cp. Pind. Ol. 10.76. ἀείδετο πᾶν τέμενος.) Phil. 613.
ἄγοιντο.
Ib. 1325. γράφου φρενῶν ἔσω.
</p>
<p>

The effect is slightly different in-
</p>
<p>

Aj. 647. φύει τ᾽ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται-<gloss>Brings forth from
the unknown, and when they are come forth, hides them in her
own breast;</gloss> where κρύπτεται = κρύπτει εἰς ἑαυτήν, <gloss>hides in her
bosom.</gloss> In Ant. 1093. ἀμφιβάλλομαι τρίχα-<gloss>I am crowned with
these locks,</gloss> the verb is passive rather than middle.</p>

</div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.2.c" n="c">

<p>
The Middle is used causatively in the following instances :-
</p>
<p>

Ο. Τ. 434. ἐστειλάμην (ἄν) - <gloss>I would have had thee ushered.</gloss>
Ib. 951. τί μ᾽ ἐξεπέμψω-<gloss>Why hast thou had me brought?</gloss>
</p>
<p>

The causative use, however, is by no means peculiar to the middle
voice, and belongs to it only per accidens. See note on O. Τ. 434.</p>

</div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.2.c" n="c">
<head>The Subjective Middle.</head>
<p>

This use of the middle voice is of much wider extent in Greek from
Homer to Plato than has been commonly supposed. It may be
familiarly explained as equivalent to the active voice with the
genitive of the reflexive pronoun. I. e. if the directly reflexive
middle=ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτόν, and the indirectly reflexive = ποιεῖν τι
ἑαυτῷ, then the subjective middle voice=ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτοῦ, ἐκ τῶν
ἑαυτοῦ, οἱ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ. Common examples are ἀποδείκνυσθαι, <gloss>To
display one's own attributes,</gloss> παρέχεσθαι, <gloss>To provide from one's
store,</gloss> ἀποφαίνεσθαι, <gloss>To declare from oneself.</gloss> Cp. Hdt. iv. 172.
διδοῖ δῶρον τὸ ἂν ἔχῃ φερόμενος ἐξ οἴκου.
</p>
<p>

Ο. Τ. 148. ὧν ὅδ᾽ ἐξαγγέλλεται- <gloss>Of the things which he
announces from himself.</gloss> Aj. 772. ηὐδᾶτο. Phil. 852.

<head>PASSIVE VOICE.</head>
<p>


Sophocles shows a singular fondness for the Passive Voice.
</p>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.a" n="a">
<p>As the active gives additional liveliness, the passive is convenient
where there is reason to prefer an impersonal mode of expression.

matters in that quarter, whether we are an object of affection
there.</gloss> Ο. Τ. 289. πάλαι δὲ μὴ παρὼν θαυμάζεται-<gloss>His absence

</p>
</div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.b" n="b">
<p>The passive has also the effect of giving a stronger emphasis to
the verb :-

Or to the object of the action, by making this the subject of the
passive form. [Hdt. iv. 105. λέγονται . . . ὑπὸ Σκυθέων . . ὡς ...
ἕκαστος λύκος γίγνεται.]


</p>
<p>

Εl. 1148. ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἀδελφή σοι προσηυδώμην ἀεί- <gloss>But I was ever
addressed by thee as sister.</gloss> Phil. 140. lyr. Διὸς σκῆπτρον ἀνάσσεται-<gloss>The staff of Zeus is swayed.</gloss> O. C. 759. ἡ δ' οἴκοι πλέον

<p>The present (or imperf.) and aorist are sometimes combined
to mark the relation of a momentary to a continuous action.

<p>

Ο. Τ. 1457. θνήσκων ἐσώθην-<gloss>I was saved when at the point
of death.</gloss> Phil. 670. εὐεργετῶν γὰρ καὐτὸς αὔτ᾽ ἐκτησάμην -<gloss>It was

<p>
There is a tense in English which has no distinct equivalent in
Greek, viz. <gloss>I have been doing</gloss> so and so. This is expressed
commonly by the imperfect, or by the present, where the action
still continues.
</p>
<p>

Τr. 600. πράσσω . . ἕως σὺ ἠγορῶ-<gloss>I am doing this, and have
been doing it, while you have been talking.</gloss>
By a similar use the present (or imperfect) participle denotes past
time. [Cp. Hdt. vii. 6. ἐξήλασέ μιν .., πρότερον χρεώμενος. Thuc. iii. 84. ἀρχόμενοι (= ἐπεὶ πρότερον ἤρχοντο).]
Τr. 281. ὑπερχλίοντες .. εἴσ᾽ οἰκήτορες (=ἐπεὶ τότε ὑπερέχλιον, νῦν

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.3" n="3">
<p>The continuous tenses are used to express endeavour. A strong
instance of this <term>conative</term> use is in-
O. C. 992. εἴ τίς σε τὸν δίκαιον αὐτίκ᾽ ἐνθάδε | κτείνοι παραστάς-
<gloss>If here and now one were to come near and attempt your life,
just man as you are.</gloss> So O. T. 688. τοὐμὸν παριεὶς καὶ καταμβλύνων κέαρ-<gloss>In seeking to divert and blunt my wrath.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.4" n="4">
<p>
The present participle partly loses the association of time, and
tends to be used simply as a noun of the agent.
Phil. 1052. νικᾶν γε μέντοι πανταχοῦ χρήζων ἔφυν-<gloss>I was born
with a desire for victory on all occasions.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

O. C. 436. οὐδεὶς

This happens especially with τίκτων and παρών: the former coming
to signify a parent, the latter an eye-witness.

Εl. 342. τῆς δὲ τικτούσης μέλειν-<gloss>And to care for the mother.</gloss>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.6" n="6">
<p>The use of the aorist in tragic Greek to point emphatically to
something in the immediate past, where the present would be
used in most languages, is well known. The momentariness of
the tense favours this mode of speaking.
</p>

<p>An extension of this use occurs where something present is made
the subject of inquiry or reflection. Here the principle seems to
be that what is thought of must have a previous existence; the
object must exist before it can be thought. (Compare the use of
ἦν in such philosophical expressions as τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι.)

Ant. 1307. ἀνέπταν φόβῳ-<gloss>I am startled with dread.</gloss>
Aj. 693. ἔφριξ᾽ ἔρωτι, περιχαρής δ᾽ ἀνεπτάμαν-<gloss>I thrill with desire, and

Ib. 1314. ἥσθην πατέρα τε τὸν ἐμὸν εὐλογοῦντά σε-<gloss>It

This aorist has a pathetic force in-
Εl. 1234-1235. ἐμόλετ᾽ ἀρτίως, | ἐφηύρετ᾽, ἤλθετ᾽, εἴδεθ᾽ οὓς ἐχρήζετε.

<head>ΕΡΕΧEGESIS</head>
<p>
Epexegesis is frequent in classical Greek, arising partly from
a fusile condition of language, in which the thought still moves,
while it is being expressed, and also from a tendency to redundance,
by which symmetry is often sacrificed to fulness and
clearness. The act of expression tends to suggest some new
aspect or point of view, which makes a sort of excrescence on the
original construction, in the shape of an explanatory clause.</p>

<head>ATTRACTION</head>
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>

Attraction is the grammatical name for a very general tendency in
Greek to draw words into apparent construction with the nearest
word. In constructions πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον the meaning takes the
place of grammatical analogy; in Attraction the meaning and the
grammatical analogy both give way to mere contiguity. A new
analogy is thus created, and is sanctioned by use.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.a" n="a">

<p>
The simplest mode of attraction is where the relative assumes
the case of the antecedent.
</p>
<p>

Εl. 177. lyr. μήθ' οἷς ἐχθαίρεις | ὑπεράχθεο.
</p>

<p>This happens even where the case of the relative without the attraction
would be other than the accusative, as in-
</p>
<p>

Ant. 546. ἃ μὴ ᾿θιγες ποιοῦ σεαυτῆς; ⅰ. Ε. ταῦτα, ὧν μὴ ᾿θίγες.
</p><p>So with the relative adverb.
Τr. 701. ἐκ δὲ γῆς, ὅθεν | προὔκειτ' (= οὗ προὔκειτο).
</p>
<p>

Where the antecedent is omitted, the preposition is sometimes
added to the case.
</p>
<p>

O. C. 334. ξὺν ᾧπερ εἶχον=ξὺν τούτῳ, ὅνπερ εἶχον.
Ib. 625. ἐν
οἶσιν ἠρξάμην= ἐν τούτοις, οἷς ἠρξάμην.
</p><p>The converse is also frequent, where the antecedent is assimilated
to the relative, or taken into the dependent clause.
Τr. 283. τάσδε δ᾽ ἅσπερ εἰσορᾷς. O. C. 1150. λόγος δ' ὃς ἐμπέπτωκεν ἀρτίως ἐμοὶ .. συμβαλοῦ γνώμην—<gloss>But give us your thought
on a matter that has just fallen in my way.</gloss> Τr. 225. οὐδέ μ'
ὄμματος | *φρουρὰν παρῆλθε, τόνδε μὴ λεύσσειν στόλον-<gloss>Nor hath it
passed my eye's strict watch, that I should fail to see this band.</gloss>
Sc. ὅδε ὁ στόλος παρῆλθεν, (ὥστε) μὴ λεύσσειν αὐτόν.
<pb n="60"/>

</p><p>
A marked example of this inverse attraction occurs in-
</p>
<p>

O. C. 1227. lyr. βῆναι κεῖθεν ὅθεν περ ἥκει, i. e. κεῖσε, ὅθεν.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.b" n="b">

<p>
The subject of an infinitive is often drawn into agreement with a
preceding dative.
</p>
<p>

Τr. 92. καὶ γὰρ ὑστέρῳ τό γ' εὖ | πράσσειν.
</p><p>An extension of this analogy to the genitive probably accounts for
the construction of the participle in-
</p>
<p>

Phil. 1140-2. ἀνδρός τοι τὸ μὲν εὖ δίκαιον εἰπεῖν· | εἰπόντος δὲ μὴ
φθονερὰν | ἐξῶσαι γλώσσας ὀδύναν-<gloss>To give full utterance to (τὸ εὐ
εἰπεῖν) a just sentiment (δίκαιον) becomes a man, but not in uttering
it to thrust forth venom from an envious tongue.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.c" n="c">

<p>
Attraction sometimes occurs in hypothetical and other coordinate
clauses besides the relative.
</p>
<p>

Aj. 488. εἴπερ τινὸς σθένοντος- <gloss>Strong if any were so.</gloss>
O. C. 734. σθένουσαν . . εἴ τιν' Ἑλλάδος.
Εl. 317. τοῦ κασιγνήτου τί φής;
ἥξοντος, ἢ μέλλοντος; i. e. ἥξοντα ἢ μέλλοντα. Aj. 1415. τῷ πάντ'
ἀγαθῷ, | κοὐδενί πω λῴονι θνατῶν
<gloss>To him who was good every
way, no one of mortals better.</gloss> O. C. 870. (σὲ δοίη βίον) τοιοῦτον οἷον κἀμὲ γηράναι (ἐγὼ is assimilated to σέ.) Τr. 683. χαλκῆς
ὅπως δύσνιπτον ἐκ δέλτου γραφήν—<gloss>Like writing on a brazen tablet,
hard to erase:</gloss> (χαλκῇ ἐν δέλτῳ γραφήν was the first thought, but has
been drawn into construction with δύσνιπτον.)
</p><p>It is part of the same tendency when, as often happens in similes,
the thing compared is expressed in terms suggested by the comparison;
e. g.
</p>
<p>

Τr. 31-3. οὓς κεῖνός ποτε, | γήτης ὅπως ἄρουραν ἔκτοπον λαβών, |
σπείρων μόνον προσεῖδε κάξαμῶν ἅπαξ.
Ib. 537-538.
</p><p>The principle of attraction might be extended so as to embrace all
cases in which constructions are determined, not by strict logical
or grammatical considerations, but by superficial associations
(hypallage, etc.). Thus in Aj. 114. τέρψις ἥδε σοι τὸ δρᾶν, ἥδε
should have been ὧδε, but is <term>attracted</term> to the nearest word.
In O. T. 1376. (τέκνων ὄψις) βλαστοῦσα = βλαστόντων.
And in
Phil. 630. δεῖξαι νεὼς ἄγοντα, the more exact construction would
have been vηΐ depending on ἄγοντα, but δεῖξαι having come first,
νεώς= ἐκ νεώς (supr. p. 10) in construction with δεῖξαι is preferred,
i. e. δείξαι ἐκ νεὼς ἄγοντα ἐπὶ νηΐ. So an answer often follows the
structure of the preceding speech though another construction
would be more logical. Instances of this will be pointed out in
the notes.

        <head>Uses of the Indicative.</head>

<p>
By the analogy of the well-known use of the past tenses of the
indicative with ἵνα, ὡς, ὅπως to express a purpose, which is either
<pb n="61"/>

in its nature impossible or contrary to fact, the same tenses
appear, in two cases, to be employed in expressing with μή a
negative wish applied to past time.

<p>

O. C. 539-41. ἐδεξάμην | δῶρον, ὁ μήποτ᾽ ἐγὼ ταλακάρδιος | ἐπωφέλησα πόλεος ἐξελέσθαι-<gloss>A gift, which would that hapless I had
not benefited the city so as to receive from her.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

Here the place of the relative conjunction ὡς or ὅπως is supplied by
the relative ὅ, and the unusual construction is perhaps assisted by
an echo or <term>harmonic</term> from ἐπωφέλησα suggesting ὤφελον.
</p>
<p>

O. C. 1713. ἰώ, μὴ γᾶς ἐπὶ ξένας θανεῖν ἔχρηζες-<gloss>Ah! would
that thou hadst not desired to die on foreign soil.</gloss> Here the
interjection takes the place of an introductory particle; and the
harshness is again softened by the sound of ἔχρηζες suggesting
ἐχρῆν σε. In both places μή is very emphatic. (Cp. Aesch. Choeph. 363 foll. μηδ᾽ ὑπὸ Τρωίας .. τέθαψαι).</p>

Here the preceding imperative hypothetically expressed (θάκησιν

Here the optative is occasioned by the strain of reflection to which
the aorists εἶδες and ἐπώτρυναν, infr. 1264, are also due. (See above,
p. 55, § 32, 6.) Similarly with the relative ἵν ἄν in O. C. 189-190,
the optative gives a turn of remoteness to the expression; ἵν᾽ ἂν

The construction πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον, where a word or clause is
placed in agreement not with the form of expression, but with
that which has been signified or implied, is not so much a mode
of construction as an explanation of various modes, including
several of those which have been described (A. 1, 3, B. 1, 2, 5).

<head>DOUBLE AND FEEBLE CONSTRUCTIONS</head>
<p>

In the analysis of a Greek sentence, it is often difficult to determine
with which of two words or clauses some word or clause is to be
joined, and the true solution sometimes is that it has a connection
with both, being joined with one in a primary, and with
the other in a secondary construction. This is a general phenomenon,
the observation of which is especially important in the
more minute study of Sophocles. The poet or speaker has two
constructions or rather analogies in his mind, and instead of
deciding upon one or other of them, as would be done by a writer
of a grammatical age, he fuses both together or allows the expression
to shift from one to the other. The well-known οἶσθ᾽ ὡς ποίησον; (Ο.Τ. 543), (a conversational idiom not confined to Sophocles),
οἶσθ᾽ ὡς . . μὴ σφαλῇς; (O. C. 75), are phrases obviously requiring
some such explanation, viz. as a confusion of ποίησον and οἶσθ'
ὡς ποιήσεις, etc. The tendency is one which prevails widely in
the Greek of this period, and has a proportionate effect on the
subtle language of Sophocles.

εἴπερ τις ἄλλος πιστὸς ὡς νομεὺς ἀνήρ. Here Λαΐου is first put absolutely
with the ellipse of δοῦλος, but is also connected with νομεὺς
ἀνήρ, which supplies the place of δοῦλος, though primarily joined
to πιστός by ὡς. Ant. 995. ἔχω πεπονθὼς μαρτυρεῖν ὀνήσιμα (ὀνήσιμα
<pb n="67"/>


after πεπ. and μαρτ.)
Ib. 1057. ἆρ᾽ οἶσθα ταγοὺς ὄντας ἃν λέγῃς λέγων;
(ταγούς (1) after λέγων, but (2) connected also with οἶσθα, whence
the participle ὄντας). Τr. 4-5. ἐγὼ δὲ τὸν ἐμὸν . . ἔξοιδ᾽ ἔχουσα δυστυχῆ τε, κ.τ.λ.
Ib. 164. χρόνον προτάξας ὡς τρίμηνον ἡνίκα . . ἀπείη
κἀνιαύσιος βεβώς. χρόνον (1) after προτάξας, but (2) to be resumed
with ἀπείη. The construction is then (3) changed to ἐνιαύσιος.
Phil. 154. lyr. τὸ γάρ μοι μαθεῖν οὐκ ἀποκαίριον. τὸ is (1) subj. of
ἀποκαίριον (the inf. being epexegetic), or (2) object of μαθεῖν; i.e.
the construction is ambiguous between τὸ γὰρ οὔκ ἐστιν ἀποκαίριόν
μοι μαθεῖν, and οὔκ ἐστιν ἀποκαίριόν μοι μαθεῖν τό. Aj. 2. πεῖράν τιν'
ἐχθρῶν ἁρπάσαι θηρώμενον- <gloss>Hunting for some adventure, to snatch
some attempt upon thy foes.</gloss> πεῖραν after (1) ἁρπ., and (2) θηρ.
ἁρπάσαι (1) governed by θηρώμενον, (2) epexegetic of πεῖραν θηρώ-
μενον.
Ib. 345. τάχ᾽ ἄν τιν' αἰδῶ κἀπ᾿ ἐμοὶ βλέψας λάβοι. ἐπ᾿ ἐμοί
is strictly to be construed with αἰδῶ λάβοι, but also suggests εἰς
ἐμέ in construction with βλέψας : i. e. βλέψας εἰς ἐμὲ αἰδῶ λάβοι ἐπ᾿
ἐμοί.
Ib. 792-793. Αἴαντος δ᾽ ὅτι .. οὐ θαρσῶ πέρι: i. e. at once οἶδα
Αἴαντος (πέρι) and οὐ θαρσῶ Αἴαντος πέρι:-the slight harshness of
the ellipse in the first construction is softened by πέρι, which was
necessary to the second. Phil. 380. καὶ ταῦτ᾽ ἐπειδὴ καὶ λέγεις
θρασυστομῶν | οὐ μὴ ποτ᾽ εἰς τὴν Σκῦρον ἐκπλεύσῃς ἔχων. (ταῦτα
probably in construction, in different senses, with λέγεις and ἔχων :
i. e. ταῦτα is supplied as the object of λέγεις by an echo from καὶ
ταῦτ᾽.. ἔχων.) O. C. 1551-1552. ἕρπω τὸν τελευταῖον βίον | κρύψων παρ'
Ἅιδην: (i. e. ἔρπω παρ' Ἅιδην κρύψων παρ' Ἅιδῃ.) Aj. 659. γαίας
ὀρύξας ἔνθα μή τις ὄψεται. γαίας is first a vague genitive of place
(<gloss>in earth</gloss>), but is afterwards helped by ἔνθα, which supplies a
partial construction. El. 1070. lyr. τὰ μὲν ἐκ δόμων νοσεῖ, | τὰ δὲ
πρὸς τέκνων διπλῆ φύλοπις οὐκέτ᾽ ἐξισοῦται, τὰ δὲ π. τ. is at first the
subject of the sentence, but is thrown out of construction by the
expansion. Aj. 805. οἱ δ᾽ ἑσπέρους ἀγκῶνας, οἱ δ᾽ ἀντηλίους | ζητεῖτ᾽
ἰόντες ἀνδρὸς ἔξοδον κακήν. Here the construction is made more
definite by the addition of ἰόντες, which is not distinctly thought
of at first.

While the subordination of sentences becomes more exact and
complex, there remains, in Greek of all periods, a form of
sentence, in which a notion essentially subordinate is coordinated
with the main predication. A familiar example occurs in the
New Testament, where the idiom is retained in the English
Authorised Version: <gloss>But God be thanked, that ye were the
servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you.</gloss> Rom. vi. 17; cp. Matt. xi. 25.
A parallel instance may also be quoted from Shak., Jul. Caes. i. 3:
<quote>Let it be who it is, for Romans now | Have thews and sinews
like their ancestors; | But, woe the while, our fathers' minds are
dead.</quote> Cp. esp. Il. 1. 182 ff. ὡς ἔμ᾽ ἀφαιρεῖται Χρυσηίδα Φοίβος Ἀπόλλων, τὴν μὲν . . πέμψω, ἐγὼ δέ κ᾿ ἄγω Βρισηίδα, κ.τ.λ. Plat. Rep. ii. 367 E, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀκούσας ἀεὶ μὲν δὴ . . ἠγάμην, ἀτὰρ οὖν καὶ τότε
ἥσθην, κ.τ.λ.

Under this head are included those modes of expression which,

The love of contrast and antithesis, which is part of the hyperlogical
tendency of the Greek of this period, gives rise to minute
oppositions and parallelisms of words which sometimes add little
to the expression: as for instance in Κάδμου τοῦ πάλαι νέα τροφή
(Ο.Τ. 1): κακὸν κακῶς (Ib. 248): στυγερὸν στυγερῶς (Phil. 166): θυτῆρα καινῷ καινὸν ἐν πεπλώματι (Τr. 613): ἀστὸς εἰς ἀστοὺς τελῶ (Ο. Τ. 222): νέα νεόθεν (O. C. 1447): νέος νέῳ ξὺν μόρῳ (Ant. 1266): αὐτὴ
πρὸς αὐτῆς (Ο. Τ. 1237): ἐξ ἁπλῆς διπλῆ (Τr. 619): τὰς οὔσας τέ
μου | καὶ τὰς ἀπούσας ἐλπίδας (Εl. 305-306): συμπεσὼν μόνος μόνοις
(Aj. 467): θάρσος .. τάρβους πέρι (Εl. 412): ἀρίστου πατρὸς αἴσχιστος
γεγώς (Phil. 1284).
</p>
<p>

[Cp. Hdt. iv. 53. καθαρὸς παρὰ θολεροῖσι.]
</p>
<p>

To a similar fondness for comparisons and distinctions is attributable
the use of τρίτος in such expressions as καὶ τὸ γενναῖον τρίτον
(O. C. 8): εἰ καὶ τρίτ᾽ ἐστί, <gloss>Be it second or third,</gloss> (O. T. 283):
and of δεύτερον, in-
</p>
<p>

O. C. 325-326. ὡς ὑμᾶς μόλις | εὑροῦσα λυπῇ δεύτερον μόλις βλέπω.
</p>
<p>

Hence also the specially Greek figure of Oxymoron. Some
wrongness or other strangeness is expressed through a contradiction
in terms, in which qualities seemingly opposite are
combined. (Hdt. iii. 147. μεμνημένος ἐπελανθάνετο.)</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="C.1.a" n="a">
<p>The Aeschylean use of this figure is simple and rugged.
Aesch. Prom. 904. ἀπόλεμος ὅδε γ᾽ ὁ πόλεμος ἄπορα πόριμος-<gloss>A war
not to be warred, plenteous in want of means.</gloss> Choeph. 42.
τοιάνδε χάριν ἀχάριτον ἀπότροπον κακῶν-<gloss>To do such unblest grace
for the averting of ill.</gloss>

</p>
<p>

But in Sophocles this, like all else, is more subtly adapted to the
expression of feeling.
</p>
<p>

Ο.Τ. 1214. δικάζει τὸν ἄγαμον γάμον πάλαι | τεκνοῦντα καὶ τεκνού-
μενον-<gloss>Condemns thee of long while being at once begetter and
begotten in that horror of an unholy marriage.</gloss> El. 1154.
μήτηρ ἀμήτωρ. O. C. 1549. ὦ φῶς ἀφεγγὲς-<gloss>Light, of which I
see no ray.</gloss> Aj. 394-395. lyr. ἰὼ σκότος, ἐμὸν φάος· | ἔρεβος ὦ φαεννότατον ὡς ἐμοί. Εl. 492. lyr. ἄλεκτρ᾽ ἄνυμφα γὰρ ἐπέβα.. γάμων ἁμιλλήμαθ᾽ οἶσιν οὐ θέμις-<gloss>For there came, between those who had
no lawful right, eager fruition of nuptials unhallowed and unblest.</gloss>
Phil. 534. ἄοικον εἰσοίκησιν<gloss>My houseless habitation.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

The nearest approach to the simplicity of Aeschylus or Herodotus
is in the words of the chorus in-
Phil. 848. ὕπνος ἄυπνος λεύσσειν.
</p>
<p>

[<term>Oxymora</term> are frequent in English poetry. Shakspeare, K. John iii. 1. <quote>When law can do no right, | Let it be lawful that law
bar no wrong;</quote> ib. <quote>All form is formless, order orderless,</quote> etc.;
John iii. 1. <quote>The better act of purposes mistook | Is to mistake again ;
though indirect, | Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</quote> and the

whole speech:
John iii. 4, <quote>Thou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness,</quote>
etc. Shelley, Prom. Unbound, i. 1, <quote>Have its deaf waves
not heard my agony?</quote>]</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="C.1.b" n="b">
<p>
In other instances the contradiction is less obvious, and depends
upon some opposition of thought.
</p>
<p>

Ant. 74. ὅσια πανουργήσασ' -<gloss>Having perpetrated a holy crime.</gloss>
Ib. 231. σχολῇ ταχύς (?).. ὁδὸς βραχεῖα γίγνεται μακρά-<gloss>I hastened
without making speed, and so a short journey is made long.</gloss>
Τr. 874. βέβηκε Δηάνειρα . . ἐξ ἀκινήτου ποδός. O. T. 190. lyr. Ἄρεα

.. ὃς νῦν ἄχαλκος ἀσπίδων, κ.τ.λ. Τr. 1052. ὑφαντὸν ἀμφίβληστρον
<gloss>A net, which is no net, but a web.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="C.1.c" n="c">
<p>
Even further removed from the simple oxymoron, but still
hingeing on the same principle of verbal contrast, are a kind
of paradoxical expressions, in which a contradiction is hinted
but not prominently brought out. These may be termed quasioxymora,
and are often equivalent to a mere negative.
</p>
<p>

Aj. 176. lyr. τινος νίκας ἀκάρπωτον χάριν<gloss>In return for some victory
bringing no return.</gloss> Phil. 1149. lyr. φυγᾷ μ᾽ οὐκ ἔτ᾿ ἀπ᾿ αὐλίων |
πελᾶτε-<gloss>No longer will ye approach me with flight,</gloss> i. e. ye will
approach me and not fly. Εl. 630. οὐδ᾽ ὑπ᾿ εὐφήμου βοῆς-<gloss>Not
even with your noise silent,</gloss> i. e. with silence from your noise.
O. C. 1575. ἐν καθαρῷ βῆναι. . τῷ ξένῳ- <gloss>To move in a clear
space for the stranger,</gloss> i. e. to leave the way clear for him:
(μὴ ἐμποδὼν βῆναι τ. ξ.). Aj. 640. ἐκτὸς ὁμιλεῖ-<gloss>Knows them
from outside,</gloss> i. e. they are gone from him. (Cp. πόρρωθεν
ἀσπάζεσθαι in Eur. Hippol. 102 and Plato Rep. 6. 499 A.) Ο.Τ. 287. ἐν ἀργοῖς οὐδὲ τοῦτ᾽ ἐπραξάμην. O. C. 185. lyr. ὅ τι καὶ πόλις |

τυχών. Phil. 1153. ἀνέδην ἐρύκεται.
</p>
<p>

This kind of expression is peculiarly Sophoclean.
Under this head may also be included such paradoxical threats

as-
</p>
<p>

Ο. Τ. 1273. ἀλλ᾽ ἐν σκότῳ τὸ λοιπὸν . . ὀψοίατο. Ant. 310. ἵν'
εἰδότες τὸ κέρδος ἔνθεν οἰστέον | τὸ λοιπὸν ἁρπάζητε.

    <head>PROLEPSIS</head>
<p>


The concentrating effort of poetry, and especially of tragic poetry,
leads to anticipatory forms of expression, called proleptic by the
grammarians, in which things successive are treated as simultaneous,
effects are viewed as concomitants, and results as attributes. Hence
an adjective has sometimes in grammar the place of an epithet, which,
in meaning, is really part of the predicate. Sophocles frequently has
recourse to this means of presenting in a single moment what would
seem more languid if expanded in the order of time.
</p>
<p>

O. C. 1200. τῶν σῶν ἀδέρκτων ὀμμάτων τητώμενος.
Tr. 106. οὔ-
ποτ᾿ εὐνάζειν ἀδακρύτων βλεφάρων πόθον. O. C. 1089. lyr. τὸν εὔαγρον
τελειώσαι λόχον-<gloss>To achieve the ambush bringing the fair prize.</gloss>
<pb n="71"/>


Ib. 1551-1552. τὸν τελευταῖον βίον | κρύψων παρ' Ἅιδην- <gloss>To hide the
end of my life with Hades.</gloss> Aj. 543. ἔρποντι φωνεῖς ἡ λελειμμένῳ
λόγων;
</p>
<p>

Such examples are to be carefully distinguished from the common
supplementary predicate expressing result, as in-
Phil. 394. lyr. Πακτωλὸν εὔχρυσον νέμεις-<gloss>Who makest Pactolus
to be rich in gold,</gloss> (but see above, pp. 38, 9). Ant. 1009. μετάρσιοι
| χολαὶ διεσπείροντο. Τr. 276. πρατόν νιν ἐξέπεμψεν. El. 1420.
παλίρρυτον γὰρ αἷμ᾽ ὑπεξαιροῦσι-<gloss>Drain the blood in an abundant
stream.</gloss> Tr. 573. μελαγχόλους | ἔβαψεν ἰούς. Phil. 720. εὐδαίμων
ἀνύσει.
</p>
<p>

These expressions are already proleptic, but, in the previous instances
the prolepsis is carried a step further by the adjective being made
an epithet or attribute.
</p>
<p>

In Aj. 647. φύει τ' ἄδηλα, we have an instance of the contrary process
of the antecedent being treated as a concomitant.
b. The same explanation may be applied to what have been called
<term>pregnant</term> constructions, where an adverbial expression signifying
the result of an action, and therefore naturally depending
on an active verb, is either construed with a neuter verb or made
to take the place of an attribute to a noun.
Phil. 1210. lyr. Φ. πατέρα ματεύων. | Χ. ποῖ γᾶς; Φ. ἐς Ἅιδου.
O. C. 383. ὅποι .. κατοικτιοῦσιν. Εl. 138. lyr. ἀλλ᾽ οὔτοι τόν γ᾽ ἐξ

    <head>ELLIPSE AND PLEONASM</head>
<p>
The remark which has been made with reference to the cases and
prepositions (pp. 9, 27) may be applied more generally, viz. that the
defect and redundancy in the language of this period arise from the
same cause, the vivid realization of the elements of language combined
with the incipient growth of reflection.
</p>
<p>

The poetical impulse has also the two elements of condensation
and fulness.

<p>
    a. Of the indicative of εἰμί the 1st and 2nd persons are omitted
in certain idioms as well as the third. This happens chiefly with
common words such as ἕτοιμος, ἄξιος, but occurs also in other cases.
Ο. Τ. 92. ἕτοιμος (εἰμί). O. C. 208. lyr. ἀπόπτολις (εἰμί).

    <head>PLEONASM</head>
<p>

Redundancy is natural to a language that is beginning to reflect
upon itself. What was at first implicit seeks to become explicit, and
finds reduplicated expression. The consciousness of imperfect utterance
gives rise to supplementary words and phrases, not contemplated
in the first formation of the sentence, which is expanded as it moves
along (see above, pp. 27, 1; 37, a; 46, e); and the same analytical
tendency which occasions the use of the auxiliary verb (see above,
p. 56, 8) gives rise to many other periphrases, such as ἔθεσθ' ἐπιστροφήν
(Ο. Τ. 134), ποδοῖν ἄρθρα (ib. 1032, πίστιν φέρειν, etc.). Other forms
of pleonasm are:-</p>

    <head>ORDER OF WORDS AND EMPHASIS</head>
<p>


In language not yet reduced to grammatical precision, the interpreter
should attend closely to the order of the words.
</p>

<p>(1) The arrangement of the sentence corresponds more nearly
than afterwards to the order in which the thoughts are suggested
to the mind of the writer.
</p>

<p>(2) There is more freedom used in the juxta-position of words for
the sake of contrast or comparison or other association: because,
the distinction of clauses being still incomplete, a parenthesis or
subordinate clause (participial or otherwise) can be more easily
interwoven with the principal clause, by the words of each being
placed alternately. This has often the effect of producing a
more equable or balanced rhythm; just as when in a single
clause the words in agreement are separated. (Ο. Τ. 109. ἴχνος
παλαιᾶς δυστέκμαρτον αἰτίας.
Ib. 1245. τὸν ἤδη Λάϊον πάλαι νεκρόν.
Aj. 311. καὶ τὸν μὲν ἦστο πλεῖστον ἄφθογγος χρόνον. Εl. 730. ναυαγίων Κρισαῖον ἱππικῶν πέδον. Τr. 436. πρός σε τοῦ . . . Διός.)
</p>

<p>(3) The exigencies, or, to speak more accurately, the proprieties of
metre must be considered. Thus, the most emphatic position
in an iambic line is in the first foot, which has the chief arsis:
and, generally, the more emphatic word is placed first, although
negatives and interrogatives, whose natural place is in the beginning
of a sentence, are sometimes made more emphatic
through being postponed.
</p>

<p>(4) In judging of constructions in Sophocles, and also in determining
the text, great weight must be given to the preservation of
rhythm and also of a natural emphasis. That a reading has the
effect of producing a strained or misplaced emphasis, or of weakening
the chief emphasis by the addition of a too emphatic word,
is an objection (whether to a reading or interpretation) of the most
<pb n="77"/>


fatal kind. The language of Sophocles is seldom quite regular,
but is always harmonious.
</p>

<p>The following examples are intended to illustrate :-(α) The alternation
of clauses. (β) The prominence of the emphatic word. (γ)
The postponement of the interrogative or negative for the sake
of emphasis. (δ) Separation of an emphatic word. (ε) Imperfect
or borrowed emphasis.

In a few instances a word has an imperfect or borrowed
emphasis, i. e. is placed in an emphatic position by reason of an
inexact antithesis, or because of the stress laid upon some other
word. This, like many other irregularities, may be accounted for
by the principle of attraction. See above, p. 60. A familiar
<pb n="79"/>


proof of the same tendency in earlier Greek is the repetition
of the personal pronoun in antitheses. (Il. 1. 184. ἐγὼ δὲ κ᾿ ἄγω.)

and for me too, I do not hold myself exempt, which, as they
say, the good Creon has set forth.</gloss> σοί, which is at first unemphatic,
as the dative of remote reference, receives an emphasis
from the antithesis of ἐμοί, which is opposed to it by an afterthought.
Ib. 76. σοὶ δ᾽ εἰ δοκεῖ. I.e. σὺ δέ, εἰ δοκεῖ σοι. Aj. 374.
ὃς χερὶ μὲν μεθῆκα τοὺς ἀλάστορας, | ἐν δ᾽ ἑλίκεσσι βουσί, κ.τ.λ.

This arises partly from the love of antithesis, and partly from comparison
and reflection. The mind in dwelling on a fact or supposition,
reverts to what is opposite or correlative, and is thus led to
refine upon the direct and natural mode of expression. (Compare

τοῦδ᾽ ἀνδρός-where the words ἄνευ τοῦδ᾽ ἀνδρός, as already noticed,
p. 65, d, are an epexegesis from the converse point of view.
</p>
<p>

A simpler case of the same tendency occurs, where, as frequently
happens, the more emphatic of two words is made grammatically
subordinate to the less emphatic.

 Not far removed in principle from such inversions is the figure
of Hypallage, by which an attribute properly applicable to the
subordinate is attached to the principal word. This may also
be viewed as a species of attraction. It has the effect of
strengthening the language, by giving an impression of unity.

It has been already noticed (p. 39) that the attempt is sometimes
made to condense a whole phrase into an adjective, and also (p. 74, 8)
that Sophocles occasionally uses abbreviations, for which there may
have been precedent in the idiom of conversation. It may now
be stated more generally that the love of concentration often leads
him to hint in a single phrase what could only be made explicit in a
complicated sentence. This happens most frequently in the choral
odes, where the vivid play of association supersedes conventional uses.

The tendency which may be roughly thus described, is peculiarly
significant of a transition phase of language: in which the mind has
become conscious of many similarities and contrasts, which, however,
are not yet clearly thought out and understood.

One point in which modern languages are more precise and exacting

word to be used twice, unless for special reasons, in the same passage.
This requirement runs counter to a natural proclivity, as all
must be aware who have had occasion to correct a hastily written
letter. The word that has most recently passed through the mind
is most likely to present itself for selection, though it is rejected
by the instinct of a modern writer. But in Sophocles this tendency
appears unchecked, and, whether from the vividness of the impression
which accompanied each word, or from whatever cause, seems to
have been unusually strong. A word once used is apt to be repeated
in a different connection and even with a different meaning.

<p>

The above examples, however, do not all belong to one and the
same class. In the lyrical measures, a phrase of the strophe is
often echoed in the antistrophe, which, according to a probable
theory, may have been chanted by a different part of the chorus.
In these cases the repetition is intentional: but in others it is
accidental.
</p>

<p>(2) A further instance of this inclination to repeat the sound, -ἥτις
ἀειδόντεσσι νεωτάτη ἀμφιπέληται, -appears in the recurrence, at
long intervals, and in quite different connections, of the same
rare word, or of the same collocation of words, or of the same
form of expression. Thus the Epic and lyric ἄфар occurs three
times in the Trachiniae, and nowhere else in Sophocles. So ἢ ῥα,
several times in the Ajax and in no other play. The hemistich
θάρσει παρέσται occurs twice in the O. C. (305,726), and τὸ κλεινὸν
Ἑλλάδος twice in the Electra (681, 694). So οὐδ᾽ ἀνίεσαν Ο.Τ. 1277, and O. C. 1608; δύ᾽ ἄτα, Ant. 533, O. C. 532; οἶσθα, Τr. 1191, 1219. Cp.
Ib. 418.
<pb n="85"/>
</p>

<p>(3) The Philoctetes, as already noticed (p. 27), is singular in having
several instances (in the last commos) of tmesis of verbs compounded
with ἀπό: and also in the frequent repetition of monosyllabic
words in excited utterance. The following are examples
of the latter tendency :-
</p>
<p>

Phil. 664-6. ὃς χθόν᾽ Οἰταίαν ἰδεῖν, | ὃς πατέρα πρέσβυν, ὃς φί-
λους, ὃς τῶν ἐμῶν | ἐχθρῶν, κ.τ.λ.
Ib. 482. ἐς ἀντλίαν, ἐς πρύμναν,

Ib. 799. ὦ τέκνον, ὦ γενναῖον.
Ib. 260. ὦ τέκνον,

Ib. 989-990. Ζεὺς ἔσθ᾽ ἵν᾽ εἰδῇς, Ζεύς.. Ζεύς, ᾧ δέδοκται
ταῦθ.
Ib. 1109-1110. οὐ φορβὰν ἔτι προσφέρων, | οὐ πτανῶν ἀπ᾿

Ib. 1128-1129. ὦ τόξον φίλον, ὦ φίλων | χειρῶν ἐκβεβιασμένον.
Ib. 1123. ὦ πόλις, ὦ πατρία.
</p><p>
The reading in some of the above instances, as well as in others
of this kind, has been doubted. But while it is freely admitted
that the scribes may have sometimes repeated a word by mistake,
it must be allowed, on the other hand, that the tendency in question
is sufficiently evident to be taken into account. The context,
with the analogy of other passages, must decide in each case
whether the MS. reading is tenable. The repetition of the same
word is of itself no objection to any reading.

<p>Concluding Remarks on Grammatical Construction
in Sophocles.
In the preceding sections many idioms have been included which
can be paralleled from other Greek writers, especially the tragedians;
while, on the other hand, no collection of scattered instances can
adequately represent the peculiarities of a writer whose strength
lies in the <gloss>callida junctura,</gloss> and the subordination of parts to the
whole. It has been impossible adequately to distinguish (a) between
the remains of earlier syntax, and the novelties of the transition age;
(6) between the phenomena of earlier Attic generally and those of the
Tragic dialect; and (c) between the individual tendencies of Sophocles
and those which he shares with Aeschylus or Euripides. But enough
has probably been said to confirm the impression which many readers
of Sophocles must have already formed, that the difficulties, inherent
in the Greek of this period, which I attempted to characterize at the
outset, are complicated in his case by a singular union of great subtilty
with great simplicity.
</p>

<p>This part of the subject may be appropriately concluded with a few
general remarks.</p>
<list>
<item>1. Sophocles has the keenest feeling for the analogies of language.</item>
<item>2. This subtle reflective tendency is perpetually causing slight modifications
or extensions of idioms in ordinary use.</item>
<item>3. The overlogical spirit, or κομψότης, of his day shows itself in
various inversions, substitutions, and other indirect modes of
expression.</item>
<item>4. Also in minute verbal parallelisms, antitheses, and paradoxes,
which, if somewhat strained in themselves, are made conducive to
the principal effect.</item>
<item>5. This analytical spirit is accompanied by a continual effort in the
opposite direction of concentration.</item>
<pb n="87"/>


<item>6. From both the last mentioned causes there results a peculiar
fulness and redundancy of expression, arising partly from the
determination to be explicit, and partly from the combination
and grouping of ideas.</item>
<item>7. The singularity of Sophocles consists not in any or all of these
characteristics, which are in some degree common to his age, but
in his subtle treatment of them, the harmony in which he binds
them together, and above all the grace with which he adapts
them to the dramatic expression of natural human feeling.</item>
<item>8. The relation of metre to language is not to be lost sight of.
The word 'exigency' which is sometimes used in this connexion is
inapplicable to a poet's work. But the correlation between speech
and rhythm, as they react upon each other, is notwithstanding a
reality. The Senarius for example, as compared with the Hexameter,
is obviously favourable to compression, to connected
periods, to synaphea, to the elaboration of a symmetrical and
carefully articulated whole. Even the increase of contracted
forms in Attic Greek may have owed something to the theatre
as well as to the agora.</item>
<item>9. The interpreter of Sophocles must think more of the sequence
of ideas than of the apparent grammatical connexion of the
words: and the critic of the text of Sophocles must ask, not,
Is such and such a phrase exact in point of syntax? but, (1) Is it
natural? (2) Is it poetical and rhythmical? (3) Is it dramatically
suitable and expressive?</item>

<head>PART II.- PECULIARITIES OF DICTION.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">
<p>
If the poet of a transition age in literature is less fettered
than his predecessors or successors in the use of grammatical constructions,
he enjoys a still more acknowledged liberty in the choice
of words. It would seem at first sight as if all the resources of
the spoken and written language were at the disposal of his invention.
There are, however, limits to this freedom. No one now
supposes, with Aristotle, that a great author ever absolutely created
a new word; and if there are words in Shakespeare (e. g. <quote>blood-boltered,</quote>
<quote>scamels</quote>) to the origin of which we have no clue, this is set to
the account of our ignorance, and not of his caprice. It is true that the
existence of inflexions in Greek, or rather the fresher consciousness
of the meaning of inflexions, gave scope for a degree of licence which
has never been possible in any modern language. But this licence
is very sparingly employed, and is more seen in the use of compounds
than in the formation of new derivatives from single stems. And
even in the selection and adaptation of existing words, the innovations

<pb n="88"/>


of the poet are subject to the following conditions :-(1) They must
be founded on the actual state of diction; (2) They must be more or
less in accordance with prevailing tendencies; (3) Words taken from
the early literature, or from a foreign dialect, must not be too far
removed from customary use, and must be such as are already known
in some way by those for whom the composition is intended. Much
also depends on the kind of composition. Thus, words which are
suitable to the style of a lyric ode would be out of place in tragic
dialogue, many others are forbidden by proprieties of metre, and
many expressions are appropriate in tragedy which an historical writer
would reject as too ornamental for his purpose; although it is to be
remembered that the distinction between poetry and prose was less
absolute in the age of Sophocles than at a later time.
</p>

<p>
Before entering on the consideration of the special peculiarities of
any writer in point of diction, it would be well to have a clear and
adequate conception of the vocabulary that lay at his command. To
give this in the case of Sophocles, however, would be to produce, not
one lexilogus, but several. The diction of the Iliad and still more of
the Odyssey, that of the Epic Cycle, whose special peculiarities are unknown
to us, that of the lyric poets, including Pindar, of the gnomic
poets, including Theognis, Solon, and Simonides, must be presupposed.
But Herodotus, who reflects the cultured intelligence of
the Ionic cities in the former half of the fifth century в. с., is of more
immediate importance for the study of tragic diction than any of these.
In comparing him with Sophocles we are led to think that the Attic
dialect, on which the Athenian agora and theatre worked many potent
changes, must at first have had much more in common with the
earlier Ionic than has been commonly imagined.<note n="1">The following words, amongst others,
are at once Herodotean and Tragic:-

of νόμος in Hdt. vii. 891, Soph. Ant. 908, Thuc. v. 105.)
</p>

<p>    
The object of the following remarks, however, is not to treat the
subject exhaustively, but to point out some of the respects in which
the use of words in Sophocles is affected (1) by the stage of language
in the age of Pericles, (2) by the poet's peculiar subtilty.
</p>

<p>    
The most general characteristic of the diction of Attic writers
before Plato is an imperfect stage of abstraction. Many words are
no longer found in the same simple concrete or metaphorical sense as
in Homer: while, as contrasted with Xenophon or Demosthenes,

<pb n="89"/>


there is in these writers more of sensuous picturesqueness, and a
richer colouring of association about single words, existing together
with a certain vagueness and indefiniteness of meaning, especially in
the use of words like γνώμη, θυμός, ὀργή, νοῦς, expressing mental states
or faculties, and such as φύσις, χρόνος, νόμος, expressing abstract natures
or ideas.
</p>

<p>    
In harmony with this state of diction was the prevailing tendency
to modify and extend the use of words :-
<list>
<item>(1) In the endeavour to express abstractions by participles, infinitives,
neuter adjectives, and verbal nouns, leading sometimes to the
substitution of a verbal noun for an infinitive, or of an infinitive or
participle for a noun, and generally to the preference for verbal
forms.</item>
<item>(2) In giving a wider and more general meaning to specific words.</item>
<item>(3) In arbitrarily assigning to generic words a specific meaning.</item>
<item>(4) In exchanging the active, neuter, passive, and causative meanings
of verbs.</item>
<item>(5) In the attempt to analyse words, and to use them with (true or
false) reference to their etymology.</item>
<item>(6) In the use of compounds and other novel words, framed after
the analogy of existing forms.</item>
<item>(7) In giving an ethical force to words, whose meaning in the
earlier language is merely physical.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>    
These tendencies appear in various modes in all the Attic writers
of the fifth century B. c., especially in poetry. In Sophocles they
take the peculiar bent of his genius. Not less bold and inventive
than Aeschylus in his choice of words, where boldness is suitable,
and more original than Euripides, he excels both in the adaptation
of his diction to the expression of the finer shades of feeling.
Without deserting simplicity, he keeps a rich variety of language in
perfect harmony; while, especially in the lyric passages, he avails
himself sometimes to an extreme of the suggestive power of many
vocables, whose significance was not yet accurately defined. Some
association, not perceived to be accidental, some echo of sound, some
refinement on the obvious meaning, is made to float before the
hearer's mind like the neutral tints which soften and harmonize the
colouring of a picture. The same difficulty which attends the determination
of construction in Sophocles is present also in the interpretation
of single words, arising from the incomplete and fluent state of
the language, in which the resolution of ambiguities, the distinction
of synonyms, the antithesis of opposites, and the definition of abstract
terms, were in an incipient stage, already engaging the activity of
reflective thought and fancy, but not yet fixed in use or in theory.
To this is added the difficulty, in interpreting a poet for whom
treatises περὶ ποιητικῆς had no existence, of discerning the degree of
figurativeness in his use of language. Sophocles is ante-rhetorical as
well as ante-grammatical.
</p>

<p>    
Most words have been originally metaphors, and metaphors are
continually falling into the rank of words. Often, indeed, when
a poet has employed a metaphor which strikes the imagination of
<pb n="90"/>


the reader or hearer with an impression of novelty, he will forthwith
depart from it, regarding it as a mere vehicle of expression,
and pass on to another, to which he is often drawn by the association
of the first. Most instances of mixed metaphor (e. g. to take arms
against a sea of troubles<gloss>$2</gloss>) are to be explained in this way. Often,
too, just as the form of a sentence is altered in process of construction,
a poetical image changes in the course of expression: e. g.

<cit rend="blockquote"><bibl>Shakespeare, Cymb. iv. 2</bibl><quote>
<l part="F">O melancholy!</l>
<l>Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find</l>
<l>The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare</l>
<l>Might easiliest harbour in?</l>

</quote></cit>





Here melancholy is first a fathomless ocean, but is presently personified
as one sailing over a shoreless sea. The imagination is not
satisfied even with this, but goes on to suppose the sluggish barge of
melancholy finding rest at last, if she can ever find it, against the oozy
bank of some slow stream. The indefiniteness of the image is not a
fault of style, but rather adds to the effect. So in the O. T. of Sophocles:-
<cit rend="blockquote"><bibl>Soph. OT 23</bibl> <quote>
    <l part="F">κἀνακουφίσαι κάρα</l>
    <l>βυθῶν ἔτ᾽ οὐχ οἷα τε φοινίου σάλου,</l>
</quote></cit>


where the city is first compared to a ship in distress, and the ship in
distress is again compared to an animal all but devoured by some
cruel monster, the confusion or reduplication of imagery, rendered
easier by the frequency of the nautical metaphor (see below, p. 105),
enhances the impressiveness of the passage.
</p>

<p>    
The following collection of instances is intended to illustrate (1)
The experimental use of abstractions, including the modification in
the meaning of words through ethical reflection : (2) The interchange
of transitive, intransitive, and causative meanings: (3) Analytical or
etymological uses: (4) Peculiarities of compounds and derivatives :
(5) Sensuous and suggestive words: (6) Epic and Lyric words and
phrases: (7) The use of metaphor.

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" n="part2.I">
<head>EXPERIMENTAL USE OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONS</head>
<p>

It is sometimes said that poetry abhors abstractions. And this
is true in the sense that technical terms, whose meaning has been
defined by systematic reasoning, are generally unsuited to the expression
of feeling. But if feeling does not choose to borrow from
the logical faculty, this is because feeling has her own way of
generalizing. And reflective poetry, whether subjective or dramatic,
in seeking to idealize feeling, is ever rising into the region of
general ideas. (See above, pp. 30, 44.) Hence the partial abstractions
which abounded in the time of Sophocles are seized by him
as welcome materials for his art. They harmonize with its ideal
character, while they assist concentration, and give an air of severity,
without detracting from the effect of naturalness and pathos.
<pb n="91"/>

</p><p>
Occasionally, in the less impassioned places, he reproduces perhaps
too exactly the sophistical spirit. But more frequently he adapts this
feature of the language to his purposes with his usual skill.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.α" n="α">
<p>
Certain notions, which have a wide range of application, are
more completely generalized than in an earlier period, and have
also more of a substantial or personal reality than would be
attributed to them by a later writer. Such are νόμος, δίκη, καιρὸς
χρόνος.
</p>
<p>

Ο. Τ. 865. lyr. ὧν νόμοι πρόκεινται | ὑψίποδες, κ.τ.λ. Ant. 538. ἀλλ᾽
οὐκ ἐάσει τοῦτό γ᾽ ἡ δίκη σε. Εl. 528. ἡ γὰρ δίκη νιν εἶλεν, οὐκ ἐγὼ
μόνη.
Ib. 75-76. καιρὸς γάρ, ὅσπερ ἀνδράσιν | μέγιστος ἔργου παντός
ἐστ᾽ ἐπιστάτης.
O. C. 1454. lyr. ὁρᾷ, ὁρᾷ ταῦτ᾽ ἀεὶ χρόνος.
</p>
<p>

In this and some other passages the idea of time, although personified,
is quite general. (In El. 179. lyr. χρόνος γὰρ εὐμαρὴς θεός,
the personification is complete.) In other cases χρόνος, like αἰών,
is not dissociated from the continuance of a single life (O. C. 7-8.
χὡ χρόνος ξυνὼν | μακρός :
Ib. 930. ὁ πληθύων χρόνος: cp. О. Т. 1082. οἱ δὲ συγγενεῖς | μῆνές με μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν διώρισαν), and in one
passage the meaning seems to be similarly limited to the duration
of the race of men-
</p>
<p>

Phil. 305. πολλὰ γὰρ τάδε ἐν τῷ μακρῷ γένοιτ᾽ ἂν ἀνθρώπων χρόνῳ.
[Cp. Hdt. vi. 109. ἐς τὸν ἅπαντα ἀνθρώπων βίον.]</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.β" n="β">
<p>
Other words appear to be in an earlier stage of abstraction.
</p>
<p>

φύσις,
</p>
<p>
 for example, occurs nowhere in the philosophical sense of
universal nature; but means always some particular nature, constitution,
birth, or origin. The place where the word has the
highest degree of generality is Aj. 760. ὅστις ἀνθρώπου φύσιν |
βλαστών-· Who having sprung in the nature of man.<gloss>Other
uses of φύσιν and φύσει, ‘by birth, by constitution, by nature, by
disposition,</gloss> etc., present various degrees of imperfect abstraction
from the meaning of the verbal noun.
</p>
<p>

ἄνθρωπος
</p>
<p>
 in the singular as well as in the plural is sometimes almost
equivalent to the abstract <gloss>mankind.</gloss> Still, though the meaning
is general, a typical individual is presented to the imagination.
</p>
<p>

Ο.Τ. 977. τί δ᾽ ἂν φοβοῖτ᾽ ἄνθρωπος, ᾧ τὰ τῆς τύχης | κρατεί. Ο. С. 1153. πρᾶγος δ᾽ ἀτίζειν οὐδὲν * ἄνθρωπον χρεών.
[Cp. τὰς διανοίας
τοῦ ἀνθρώπου in Thuc. i. 140.]</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.γ" n="γ">
<p>
But the incompleteness and indefiniteness of abstractions is
chiefly seen in words denoting mental acts and states, such as
θυμός, φρόνησις, γνώμη, ὀργή, πόθος, ἐλπίς, ἔρως; or mental powers,
such as νοῦς, ψυχή, καρδία, φρήν. Such words are used without the
exactness of distinction which was afterwards introduced by reflection
and use, the shade of meaning intended being left to
be determined by the context:-and they are accompanied with
a peculiar feeling of the wonderful nature of man. This phase
of ethical or psychological language is familiar to the student of
Thucydides, and it is immediately obvious how large must be its
<pb n="92"/>


application to the purposes of the dramatic poet. In Sophocles
there are various grades of ethical significance, from the simplest
lyrical personification, as in El. 198. δόλος ἦν ὁ φράσας, ἔρος ὁ
κτείνας, to such quasi-scientific discrimination of terms as in
Ant. 176. ψυχήν τε καὶ φρόνημα καὶ γνώμην, where however the
sophistical parade of words is merely a piece of mannerism, and
the attempt to distinguish accurately the connotation of the
several terms is not only difficult but illusory.

</p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>
It will be sufficient to adduce one or two examples of the use
of such words in Sophocles. A glance at any lexicon to Sophocles
will suggest many others.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.γ.1" n="1">
<p>
θυμός occurs once only in the seven plays in the sense of <gloss>mind</gloss>
or <gloss>memory,</gloss> and in this there is probably a reminiscence of
Homer.
Εl. 1347. οὐδέ γ᾽ ἐς θυμὸν φέρω-<gloss>Nor can I bring him to my
mind.</gloss> (Cp. Fr. 595. πόλλ᾽ ἐν κακοῖσι θυμὸς εὐνηθεὶς ὁρᾷ.)
</p>
<p>

Nearly the same form is used by Jocasta in Ο. Τ. 975. μή νυν ἔτ᾿
αὐτῶν μηδὲν ἐς θυμὸν βάλῃς. But here θυμός is associated, as it is
almost everywhere in Attic Greek, with the emotional nature.
Not, <gloss>Do not cast it in your mind,</gloss> (as in Hdt. i. 84, ἐφράσθη καὶ
ἐς θυμὸν ἐβάλετο: Aesch. P. V. 706, τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους | θυμῷ βάλ',)
but rather, <gloss>Do not take it to heart.</gloss> Cp. ἐνθύμιον,
Aesch. P. V. 739 : ὑψοῦ
γὰρ αἴρει θυμόν,
Aesch. P. V. 914. In this last instance θυμός is not thought
or feeling simply, but the mind agitated by feeling; i.e. in the
present case by <gloss>doubts and fears.</gloss> <gloss>Oedipus lets his mind be
lifted into high suspense by all manner of griefs.</gloss> Here θυμός
(cp. φρήν, Τr. 982, О. С. 1182; βίοτος, Ο. Τ. 612; αἰών, Phil. 1348)
is spoken of as a real thing or substance, as if separable from
the person himself. θυμός is elsewhere the seat or origin of
particular emotions, as <gloss>desire,</gloss> O. C. 778, El. 286; <gloss>fear,</gloss>
O. C. 1466, ἔπτηξα θυμόν; <gloss>anger,</gloss> El. 331, cp. Phil. 324; and
<gloss>courageous ardour</gloss> or 'confidence, El. 26. θυμὸν οὐκ ἀπώλεσεν :
Aj. 1124. ἡ γλῶσσά σου τὸν θυμὸν ὡς δεινὸν τρέφει.
</p>
<p>

This meaning of θυμός, as a principle, is not always easy to distinguish
from the more special, and in Attic Greek the more
common meaning, of a state or condition of anger. Instances
in which it has been supposed to mean anger, but where it more
probably means an angry or agitated mind, are-
</p>
<p>

Ant. 493. φιλεῖ δ᾽ ὁ θυμὸς πρόσθεν ᾑρῆσθαι κλοπεὺς | τῶν μηδὲν ὀρθῶς
ἐν σκότῳ τεχνωμένων-<gloss>And when men are plotting wrong in secret,
their distracted mind is oft convicted of concealment before the
act.</gloss>
Ib. 1097. ἀτῇ πατάξαι θυμόν - <gloss>To bring down the blow of
calamity on the passionate heart.</gloss> Aj. 954. ἢ ῥα κελαινώπαν θυμὸν
ἐφυβρίζει πολύτλας ἀνήρ. O. C. 434. όπηνίκ᾽ ἔζει θυμός.
Ib. 438.
κἀμάνθανον τὸν θυμὸν ἐκδραμόντα μοι | μείζω κολαστὴν τῶν πρὶν ἡμαρτημένων, where τὸν θυμόν may be rendered, <gloss>My passionate mood.</gloss>
<pb n="93"/>


</p>
<p>

In the more limited sense of a condition of anger, θυμός becomes
again <gloss>hypostatized,</gloss> and is spoken of as a separate nature or
idea.
</p>
<p>

Ο. Τ. 673. ὅταν | θυμοῦ περάσῃς.
γῆράς ἐστιν ἄλλο πλὴν | θανεῖν.

O. C. 954. θυμοῦ γὰρ οὐδὲν
(Cp. Heraclitus, χαλεπὸν θυμῷ μάχεσθαι.)</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.γ.2" n="2">
<p>νοῦς, which is commonly, and in later Greek exclusively, an
intellectual principle, in Ant. 767 is used for θυμόςνοῦς δ᾽ ἐστὶ τηλικοῦτος ἀλγήσας βαρύς.
</p>
<p>

The danger suggested by the chorus, however, lies not only in the
resentment of Haemon, but in the invention and contrivance
which the resentment sets to work. Cp. also El. 913. μητρὸς
οὔθ᾽ ὁ νοῦς φιλεῖ | τοιαῦτα πράσσειν.
</p>
<p>

The meaning of this word, like that of θυμός, is intermediate between
a principle or faculty and a condition or state.

Ant. 1090. τὸν νοῦν τ᾽ ἀμείνω τῶν φρενῶν.

The frequent use of the neuter adjective or participle with the
article, which is characteristic of the Greek of this period, affords
further illustration of the effort to give expression to the general
notions which the mind was forming for herself. Sophoclean
instances are-
</p>
<p>

Ant. 365. τὸ μηχανόεν τέχνας-<gloss>The inventiveness of art.</gloss> Tr. 398. τὸ πιστὸν τῆς ἀληθείας <gloss>The trustworthiness of truth.</gloss>

It is probable that in Aj. 208. τί δ᾽ ἐνήλλακται τῆς ἡμερίας, we have a
similar use of the feminine adjective, with ὥρας, καταστάσεως, ΟΓ
some such word, to be supplied. And in Tr. 837. μελαγχαίτα,
a masculine adjective seems to be used as a noun.</p>

There may also be mentioned, as belonging to this transitional

<p>
The vagueness of abstract notions, and the tendency to
form them, together with the absence of definitions, lead to the
extension of words from a special to a more general meaning,
and also to the specializing of general words, for want of the
distinctions that are required for the exact expression of a specific
idea. Both uses may be described as vague, and arise from the
same uncertainty in the distribution of general terms.
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.ε.1" n="1">
<p>One general word has a variety of specific meanings. (See

(1) the sentiment of affection in Ant. I, where κοινόν is not
merely having the same parents,' but <gloss>sharing with me in birth
and all things else:</gloss> (2) the horror of the confusion of relations

Even words of such general meaning as πράσσω, πρᾶξις, ἔργον,
ἐσθλός, κακός, are often used by Sophocles, where a specific expression
would be required in any modern language. See esp.
Aj. 132-133. τοὺς δὲ σώφρονας | θεοὶ φιλοῦσι καὶ στυγοῦσι τοὺς κακούς,
where κακούς is made the contrary of σώφρονας, a more specific
word. Sometimes the specific meaning intended is not strictly
contained in the generic word employed. See e.g. Tr. 887,
where ὕβρις is applied to suicide; and Phil. 207, where ἀνάγκη
is used for extreme difficulty.

On the other hand, some words are made to drop their particular
significance and to express a simple and general idea.
</p>
<p>

The most obvious example of this is in the number of words which
are almost equivalent to εἰμί :-βεβηκέναι, ἥκειν, καθεστάναι, ἑστάναι,
κεῖσθαι, πέλειν, τυγχάνειν, κυρεῖν, φαίνεσθαι, which have always some
special appropriateness to the context in which they are found, but
hardly convey more than the simple meaning of the substantive
verb.
</p>

<p>Other instances are the use of ἁπλοῦς as almost equivalent to εἷς,
δεδορκέναι for ζῆν (El. 66.), and also the following :-

Ib. 198 lyr. δόλος ἦν ὁ φράσας.

<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.II.a" n="a">

<p>
The transitive use of intransitive verbs is rare, except in
constructions πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον, such as El. 147. ἀλλ᾿ ἐμέ γ' ἁ
στονόεσσ᾽ ἄραρεν φρένας (see above, p. 23). For the cognate accusative
after neuter verbs, see above, p. 24.
</p>

<p>A clear instance of a neuter verb used actively is in-</p>
<p>

O. C. 1282. ἢ δυσχεράναντ' - <gloss>Or having moved dislike.</gloss></p>
<p>

The adjectives διάτορος, ὁμόσπορος, ὁμογενής, νομάς, δύσφορος, νηλής,
ἡλιοστερής, ὀκνηρός, εὐτυχής, and others, are used sometimes in an
active as well as in a neuter or passive sense. (In some cases,
of course (διατόρος, etc.), the accentuation is changed.)</p>
<p>

The verbal μεμπτός has an active meaning in-</p>
<p>

Τr. 445-446. ὥστ᾽ εἴ τι τὠμῷ τ᾽ ἀνδρὶ τῇδε τῇ νόσῳ | ληφθέντι μεμπτός
εἰμι, κάρτα μαίνομαι. Cp. ὑπέροπτα, Ο. Τ. 883, ἀμφιπλήκτων, Phil. 687.</p>
<p>

Other verbal adjectives, and derivatives of verbal adjectives, are
used with meanings not directly passive, e. g. ῥιπτός, i. e. διὰ ῥιπῆς
γενόμενος, Τr. 357 ; λωβητός, i. e. λωβὴν ἔχων,
Ib. 538; ἀμφίπλεκτος,
i. e. ὑπ᾿ ἀμφιπλεκόντων ἀλλήλοις περαινόμενος,
Ib. 520.</p>
<p>

The rare active forms ἅζειν, O. C. 134, μηχανᾶν, Aj. 1037 (cp. Hom.
Od. 18. 143), are adapted to the places where they occur,
in both of which the active voice gives absoluteness to the
expression. See above, p. 51.</p>
<p>

σέβω, <gloss>to revere,</gloss> and so absolutely to shew piety,' Ant. 745, 872.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.II.b" n="b">
<p>
The chief examples of verbs used causatively are the following-</p>
<p>

Τr. 1142. τὸν σὸν ἐκμῆναι πόθον: (cp. Eur. Bacch. 36.) Phil. 297. ἔφην᾿ ἄφαντον φῶς-lit. <gloss>I caused to shine.</gloss> Aj. 196. ἄταν..
φλέγων. O. C. 721. φαίνειν ἔπη.
Ib. 1282. ἢ κατοικτίσαντά πως
<gloss>Or having induced some pity.</gloss> Cp. the use of the middle v.
in Τr. 535. συγκατοικτιουμένη- <gloss>To claim for myself your sympathy
and pity.</gloss>
</p>

<p>In El. 162. lyr. Διὸς εὔφρονι βήματι, either the verbal noun is causative,
<gloss>Zeus propitiously causing him to come,</gloss> or the causative
meaning is contained in the genitive, <gloss>With propitious coming
sped by Zeus.</gloss> The former agrees best with εὔφρονι.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.II.c" n="c">

<head>ANALYTICAL OR ETYMOLOGICAL USES</head>

<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
<p>
While usage was comparatively unfixed and reflection was
already actively employed on language, there was a natural tendency
to make experiments through the analysis of words. Having more
of the original meaning than afterwards, words can be used more
freely, and thus admit of wider application; while on the other hand
they are objects of curiosity, and attention is drawn to their essential
significance. One case of this analytical activity has been already
noticed (p. 27, B), where the preposition in composition acquires
a separate force.
Ο. Τ. 175. ἄλλον δ᾽ ἂν ἄλλῳ προσίδοις. Τr. 842. μεγάλαν προσορῶσα δόμοις βλάβαν. Phil. 320. συντυχών κακῶν | ἀνδρῶν Ἀτρειδῶν.
Τr. 662. ἐπὶ προφάσει θηρός.
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.III.a" n="a">
<p>
Through this tendency, combined with that towards verbal expressions
(p. 93), nouns originally verbal, which have come
simply to designate an object, regain their verbal force.
</p>
<p>

ὄμμα (from stem ὄπτ-) is generally <gloss>the eye:</gloss> but in Sophocles is also
(1) <gloss>a look,</gloss> Aj. 193, Tr. 914. λαθραῖον ὄμμ᾽ ἐπεσκιασμένη.
(2) <gloss>Power of insight,</gloss>
Ib. 1018. σοί τε γὰρ ὄμμα | ἔμπλεον ἢ δι᾽ ἐμοῦ
σώζειν. (3) An object of vision, Aj. 1004. ὦ δυσθέατον ὄμμα καὶ
τόλμης πικρᾶς. (4) The <gloss>effluence</gloss> from the object (see Plato,
Men. 76 D), El. 902. ἐμπαίει τί μοι | ψυχῇ σύνηθες ὄμμα. (5) ‘Appearance,
Tr. 379. ἢ κάρτα λαμπρὰ καὶ κατ᾿ ὄμμα καὶ φύσιν. (6)
<gloss>Light,</gloss> in a metaphorical sense, as giving joy,
Ib. 203. ὡς ἄελπτον
ὄμμ᾽ ἐμοὶ | φήμης ἀνασχὸν τῆσδε νῦν καρπούμεθα. (7) With ethical or
pathetic associations, Aj. 140. πτηνῆς ὡς ὄμμα πελείας : Τr. 527-528.
τὸ δ᾽ ἀμφινείκητον ὄμμα νύμφας | ἐλεινὸν ἀμμένει: Aj .977. ὦ ξύναιμον
ὄμμ᾽ ἐμοί : cp. Phil. 171. μηδὲ σύντροφον ὄμμ᾽ ἔχων.
</p>
<p>

So θρέμμα, generally, that <gloss>which is nourished up,</gloss> <gloss>a creature.</gloss> But
from the association of τρέφεσθαι, <gloss>to clot together</gloss> (whence
θρόμβος), in Tr. 574. θρέμμα λερναίας ὕδρας is partly the venom
nursed in the hydra, partly (cp. supr. 572, ἀμφίθρεπτον αἷμα) the
poison clotted about the wound.
</p>
<p>

βορά, which commonly means <gloss>food,</gloss> in Ant. 1017 means <gloss>eating.</gloss>
Cp. Hdt. i. 119. ὡς δὲ τῷ Ἁρπάγῳ ἐδόκεε ἅλις ἔχειν τῆς βορῆς.
</p>
<p>

ναύτης, <gloss>a sailor,</gloss> though not derived from a verb, has a verbal
termination, and in Philoctetes 901 = πλωτὴρ ἐν τῇ νηΐ.

Sometimes a word has more than one association. E. g. :-
</p>
<p>

καλλιστεία is properly the prize for beauty or nobleness, but in Aj. 435, is rather the prize of the most beautiful, the most beautiful
given as a prize.
</p>
<p>

πάραυλος, as derived from αὐλός, properly means <gloss>out of tune,</gloss> but
in Aj. 892 seems to mean <gloss>neighbouring,</gloss> from παρά, αὐλή, with
the additional meaning (from αὐλός) of <gloss>sounding near.</gloss> So in
Ο. Τ. 186. ὅμαυλος means (1) ' in the same dwelling, but also
(2) <gloss>sounding together, blending.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

ἰός in Tr. 833 means <gloss>poison</gloss> as in 771, but with an allusion to
the poisoned arrow, which is also iós (Ib. 574).
</p>
<p>

προπετές in Τr. 701 is (1) <gloss>fallen to the earth;</gloss> (2) <gloss>on the point of
disappearing.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.III.c" n="c">
<p>
This kind of confusion is more apt to occur in the case of words
not in familiar use, such as ἀμενηνός, used in Epic poetry of the
dead, from a, μένος, <gloss>without strength:</gloss> applied by Sophocles
to Ajax (Aj. 890), with an association from a, μένω, <gloss>having no
abiding place.</gloss> Ajax escapes their search as the shade of a dead
man fleets from the embrace of his friend. (A similar process
is observable in modern languages. Thus <quote>shamefast</quote> has
been transformed to <quote>shamefaced,</quote> and words like <gloss>aufheben,</gloss> <gloss>beziehung,</gloss> receive their second intention in German philosophy.)
</p>
<p>

ἀμφίγυος is properly <gloss>two-edged,</gloss> of a weapon, but in Tr. 504, reverting
to the etymology from yuῖον, <gloss>with active limbs on both
sides,</gloss> like ἀμφιδέξιος, <gloss>well-trained all round,</gloss> as we should say.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.III.d" n="d">
<p>
To come now to more obvious instances of etymological association
and reflection :-
</p>
<p>

ἀντίπαλος commonly means <gloss>equally matched;</gloss> but in Ant. 126. ἀντιπάλῳ . . δράκοντι appears to be used in the more literal meaning
of <gloss>struggling against odds.</gloss> Cp. Milton's use of <gloss>reluctant.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

ἀγώνιος, <gloss>belonging to a contest;</gloss> but ἀγώνιος σχολή, Aj. 195, at
once <gloss>a contentious idleness,</gloss> and <gloss>an idleness full of danger :</gloss>
i. e. (1) ᾗ ἀγωνίζεται πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους, (2) ἐν ᾗ περὶ ψυχῆς ἀγωνί-
ζεται ὁ Αἴας.
</p>
<p>

ἀμφιπολῶν, properly <gloss>attending;</gloss> but in O. C. 680, as if ἀμφὶ πολῶν, <gloss>moving in and out amongst.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

δραπέτης, <gloss>fugitive;</gloss> but, in Aj. 1285, used metaphorically with a
verbal allusion to the falling of the lot into the urn.
</p>
<p>

ἔκτιμος, <gloss>away from honour;</gloss> but in El. 241. γονέων ἐκτίμους, <gloss>away
from honouring my parents.</gloss>
</p>
<p>

λέχριος, <gloss>slanting;</gloss> connected by etymology with λικριφίς='obliquus,'
but in tragedy (O. C. 195) as if from λέχος, <gloss>half-recumbent.</gloss>

</p>
<p>
παραδιδόναι, <gloss>to give over;</gloss> but in Phil. 399, with the additional
meaning of <gloss>wrongfully,</gloss> <gloss>away from the rightful owner.</gloss>

</p>
<p>

τετραορος (τετράοροι..ἵπποι, Od. 13. 81), <gloss>yoked four together.</gloss>
But in Tr. 507, as if from ἀείρω, <gloss>raised on all fours:</gloss> i. e. quadruped.
Here, however, the latter part of the compound is unemphatic.
See below.

<head>ANALYTICAL OR ETYMOLOGICAL USES</head>
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>
Ionic Greek as well as Attic poetry delights in compounds,
and tragedy retains considerable freedom in their use, although from
frequent repetition the less emphatic element in a compound word is
often comparatively insignificant. (Cp. the following Hesiodic compounds,
ἀδώτης, ἀμβολιεργός, πρωτηρότης, ἀκροκνέφαιος, ὀρθρόγοος, ἡμερό-
κοιτος, and words like αὐτογενής, κρεισσότεκνος in Aeschylus.)
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.1" n="">

<p>There is more freedom than appears afterwards in compounding
stems with prepositions, especially ἐκ and ἐν. Thus, ἀναδοχή,
ἀποβλαστάνω, ἀπορθόω (cp. Plat. Legg. 757 E), ἐκθεῶμαι, ἐκκομπάζω,
ἐκλήγω, ἐκλωβάω, ἐκλωπίζω, ἐκπέλει=ἔξεστι, ἐκπροτιμῶ, ἐκχράω, ἔμπολις,
ἔνεδρος, ἐνθακέω, ἐνθαλάσσιος, ἐξαμαρτία, ἐξατιμάζω, ἐξαπεῖδον, ἐξαυδάω,
ἐξελευθεροστομέω, ἐξευτρεπίζω, ἐξεφίεμαι, ἐξικετεύω, ἐξοικήσιμος, ἐξόμιλος,
ἐξύπερθε, καταυδάω, are all new compounds.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.2" n="2">

<p>A complex predicate or attribute is sometimes expressed by a
rare compound; e.g. ἀνάνδρωτος, ἀριστόχειρ, ἀρτίκολλος, ἀρτίχριστος,
ἀρχέπλουτος, δίπαλτος, δολόμυθος, ἡδύπολις, κοινότοκος, λιθόλευστος,
μελάγχολος, σιτόνομος, τελεόμηνος, τρυσάνωρ, ὑψίπολις, χαλαργός,
χαλκόπλακτος.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.3" n="3">

<p>On the other hand, a simple attribute is often expressed by a
compound adjective, the inferior part of which repeats some
notion which is already implied in the noun or other neighbouring
word. This is especially frequent with the compounds of
πούς; e.g. δεινόπους ἀρά (ἐλᾷ), χαλκόπους ὀδός (threshold of brazen
floor), ὠκύπους ἀγών, νόμοι πρόκεινται ὑψίποδες, κοινόπους παρουσία, δολιόπους ἀρωγός. Other combinations are δυσπάρευνον λέκτρον, λαθί-
πονον ὀδυνᾶν, πολυθύτους σφαγάς (Τr. 791, 1021, 756), ἄνδρ᾽ ἕν οἰόζωνον (Ο. Τ. 846), πυκνόπτεροι ἀηδόνες (O. C. 17-18). But though
frequently redundant, the less prominent part of a compound
is hardly ever wholly irrelevant in Sophocles.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.4" n="4">

<p>
In some instances the simple word is used for the compound, as
ὄντες for παρόντες, Ant. 1109; ἵσταμαι for ἀνίσταμαι, Ο. Τ. 143;
ὁρᾶν for προορᾶν, <gloss>to provide,</gloss> Phil. 843, Aj. 1165; βαλεῖς for
προσβαλεῖς, Phil. 67.</p>

The privative prefix is sometimes used with a limited intention,

hand.</gloss></p>

Favourite words denoting colour and form, such as κελαινός, χλωρός,

rich and deep, and the vagueness and inarticulateness of the language
which described them, may have helped this tendency. <gloss>The

the stains of many combats; the <gloss>blue-grey vintage,</gloss> γλαυκὴ ὀπώρα,

rain,</gloss> μέλας ὄμβρος, O. T. 1278, recals the Homeric μέλαν αἷμα, as

</p><p>
χλωρός, <gloss>grass-green,</gloss> is applied (1) to the dew of tears (Tr. 847);
(2) to life-blood (Ib. 1055); (3) to the sea-sand (Aj. 1064). The
association in the first passage seems to be that of tenderness and
softness (τέρεν, θαλερὸν δάκρυ); in the second that of freshness and
young vigour; the exact meaning of the word in the third case
is doubtful. Perhaps the pale <gloss>yellow</gloss> sand, perhaps the moist,'
smooth and glistering sand.

A favourite word denoting form is κοῖλος. It is applied as an
ornamental epithet to the couch which is to receive the pressure
of Heracles, Tr. 901; to the vale of Argos, O. C. 378; to the
bowl of Theseus and Pirithous,
Ib. 1593; to the grave to be
prepared for Ajax, Aj. 1403; and to the casket of Deianira, Tr. 692. It is used more suggestively of the cave of Philoctetes,
Phil. 1081; of the old pear-tree, O. C. 1596; of the stony
receptacle of Antigone, Ant. 1205; and lastly of the doors,
which yield and <gloss>hollow in</gloss> before the impetuous rush of

<p>
Influence of association on the choice of words.
</p>
<p>

In many passages of the choric songs, as in all lyric poetry, the
connection of ideas is often guided rather by association than
by any regular sequence either of thought or fact. A typical
instance of this is supplied by the stasimon of the Trachiniae in
which the long chain of causes which have led to the pain of
Heracles are crushed together in a few words so that the links
can hardly be separated (Tr. 836-40): <gloss>He is steeped in the
dreadful apparition of the Hydra,</gloss> i. e. his veins are saturated
with poison from the wound made by the arrow of Hercules,
which he had steeped in the venom of the Hydra, that dreadful
monster. <gloss>And mingled therewith the murderous stings of
crafty speech from the Centaur burst forth upon him and
torment him;</gloss> i. e. this poison, which breaks out in stinging
sores, was applied in consequence of the guileful advice of the
Centaur, given with intent to cause his death, and this fact adds
<pb n="104"/>
to the cruelty of the torment. The attentive consideration of
this passage may prepare the way for an interpretation of
Antigone 599-603, which might otherwise appear strained :—
<gloss>The light of life that still was spread above the last remaining
fibre of the stock of Oedipus, is again swept down (see notes
in loco) by the dust consecrated to the infernal gods, which is (1)
bloodstained, (2) cruel (both expressed in powía), and by madness
of thought and infatuation of mind;</gloss> i. e. By sprinkling dust on
Polynices, to which she is prompted by mad reasoning and
heaven-sent fury, Antigone is herself overwhelmed by the dust
of death, so quenching the last hope of the house of Oedipus.
When thus read in the light of association, the words are seen
to be more harmonious than if κόνις be exchanged for κόπις,
which introduces a grotesque and commonplace image that has
nothing to do with the story.

<head>EPIC AND LYRIC WORDS AND PHRASES</head>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="57"/>

That a large element of Tragic Greek is derived from Epic
and Lyric poetry is a patent fact. Whether words and phrases which
Sophocles has in common with Homer were taken by him from the
Iliad and Odyssey, or from some other source, cannot clearly be
determined. The following are a few typical examples of Epic and
Lyric diction.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.1" n="1">

<p>
Words and phrases seeming to be directly borrowed from the
Epic diction are ἀμφηκής, ἀνάρσιος, ἕκατι, ἦμος, ὁδίτης, ῥίγησαν,
ὠρώρει, ἀμφιχανών, ἄναλκις, ἀπείργαθον, ἀτίζω; ἀτρύγετος, Fr. 423;
αὖθι, Fr. 468 ; βαθύρρους; πολύτλας (of Odysseus); ναμέρτεια (from
νημερτής); κοίλην κάπετον; ὦ μοι ἐγώ, τί πάθω ; ἐνέδησεν ἄτα.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.2" n="2">

<p>
Sometimes an Epic word is used, but with some modification of
meaning; e. g. θοὰν νύμφαν, <gloss>a bride swiftly borne;</gloss> ἀμενηννὸν ἄνδρα, <gloss>the lost hero;</gloss> λakev, sounded forth,' of an oracle; didnλos,
κλυτός, ἀριφραδής, ἐν φίλαισι χερσίν (Εl. 1138).</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.3" n="3">

<p>
Or an Attic phrase is so turned as to recal the Homeric idiom,
as in ἐπίπονον ἡμέραν like δούλιον ἦμαρ, Ἰφίτου βίαν like βίη Ηρακληείη, φίλτατον .. κάρα like φίλη κεφαλή, δι' αἰθέρα τεκνωθέντες, cp.
αὐθρηγενής. With these may be classed such epithets, having an
Epic colouring, as πάτραν διήνεμον, Τr. 327; νηὶ ποικιλοστόλῳ,
Phil. 343.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.4" n="4">

<p>
Many words are used which are common to Epic and Lyric, but
rare in Attic Greek; e. g. ἄφαρ, ἀφνεός, ὁρῶμαι (middle voice),
ἀτάλλω, ζαμενής, αἴθων, ἀμαιμάκετος, ἀντάω (=τυγχάνω), ἀτύζεσθαι, πορεῖν,
οὔλιος, ἠπύω, ὀμφή, αἰπύς, ἦ ῥα, ἐπίηρα φέρειν, αἰνός, χρύσεος (*), <gloss>glorious,</gloss> χάλκεος, <gloss>indestructible.</gloss></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.5" n="5">

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.6" n="6">

<head>KINDS AND DEGREES OF METAPHOR</head>
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>
The language of Sophocles is for the most part not highly
figurative. But some images are so familiar in Attic poetry that they
almost cease to be metaphors, and (see above, p. 92) are to be viewed
merely as words. The tendency to abstraction, giving the power of
fixing the attention on the leading notion of a word, apart from the
particular associations, contributed to this.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.1" n="1">

<p>
The most familiar of all images to an Athenian audience were
those connected with the sea. Such expressions as <gloss>The haven
of a cry,</gloss> <gloss>Sailing into a harbourless marriage,</gloss> <gloss>The long and
rough voyage from Thebes to Athens,</gloss> are less figurative in
Attic Greek than they would be in other languages. (Cp. Hdt. iii. 155, § 3. ἐξέπλωσας τῶν φρενῶν.) When we speak of a government
being wrecked on a certain measure, our imagination
seldom reverts to the figure of a shipwreck, or of a sunken rock,
and something of the kind is true of the use of λιμήν, ὅρμος,
σαλεύω, ὀρθόω (to right the vessel), πλοῦς, ξύμπλους, οὖρος, κατουρίζω,
ἐρέσσειν, and the like words in Sophocles. This nautical imagery
is a vehicle of expression which is always at hand. Hence,
while mixed metaphors are allowable, and the figurative language
is often not to be pressed, an occasional hyperbolical boldness is
easily accounted for. <gloss>The whole Crissean plain was filled with
equestrian shipwrecks.</gloss> <gloss>He avoided the boiling surge of horses
with their riders</gloss> (El. 729-733). The same remark applies in a
less degree to other familiar aspects of life, such as war, the
public games, wrestling, running, archery, health and disease,
fair weather and storm, ploughing, sowing, reaping, etc.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.2" n="2">

<p>
Another kind of familiarity belonged to images that had been
used in the earlier poetry. Such figures as the <gloss>cloud of grief,</gloss>
or <gloss>the fire of destruction,</gloss> <gloss>he grew up like a young plant,</gloss>
which had been consecrated by Homer, could be handled with
greater freedom than those which were of recent invention, such
as <gloss>The unbending oak borne down by the torrent.</gloss> (Ant. 714.)
They could be extended and modified like grammatical idioms
and the uses of words. This cause also gives rise to mixtures or
transitions of metaphor, <gloss>Guile-woven fate anoints him with the
Centaur's gory cloud,</gloss> <gloss>My cloud of darkness coming over me,
like a ship wafted by too sure a gale,</gloss> <gloss>The battle God is burning
me with shouts of onset.</gloss> (Tr. 831, O. T. 1314,
Ib. 191.)</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.3" n="3">

<p>There is also a class of words originally metaphorical, which
are not felt to be so, because the analogy on which their meaning
rests is not sufficiently remote to give the impression of poetical
imagery. These can hardly be distinguished from the generalized
uses mentioned in p. 94. Such expressions as <gloss>to merchandize
advantage,</gloss> <gloss>to feed on hopes,</gloss> <gloss>to bind in a tomb-like chamber,</gloss> <gloss>the oared vehicle of a ship,</gloss> <gloss>to give the ship her head</gloss> (ναῒ 
μεθεῖναι), although not literal, are hardly figurative.

The Peculiarities of Language in Sophocles considered with
reference to the settlement of the Text.</head>
<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
<p>
Some such review of the language of Sophocles as that which
has been imperfectly attempted in this Essay, appears to be necessary
in order to interpret him with an approach to certainty. It may also
furnish some criterion of the value of emendations of the text. The
minute study of the MSS., the Scholia, and the notices of the grammarians,
is of course indispensable to this end. But the most perfect
<term>apparatus criticus</term> may be only illusory, and may encourage an opinio
copiae, which is inter causas inopiae, if it is made the basis of conjectural
alteration, without a right conception of the original woof and texture
of the <gloss>old garment,</gloss> which is thus patched.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.1" n="1">
<p>
Many places would never have been suspected of corruption, if
the unfixed, growing, and transitional nature of the language had been
fully recognized. Subtle and cautious scholars like Hermann and
Elmsley were more conscious of this than most of their successors.
But their fine perceptions of certain nuances of style and idiom, for
want of some systematic statement of them, have often passed unregarded,
and were not sufficiently carried into application even by
themselves. Had they more fully expressed themselves on this subject,
they would have produced a critical instrument of finer temper
and more effective although more delicate use, than without this can
be forged from palaeographical materials, and the expedients which
these suggest.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.2" n="2">
<p>
This subject has lately received an illustration from the disputes
which have arisen about the text of Shelley. If that poet's subtle
use of language has given rise to supposed emendations, sometimes
on the part of those who had lived with him and knew his mind, and if
rational criticism has been brought to set aside most of those changes
within half a century of his death, how hazardous must such attempts
be in the case of Sophocles, or, still more, in that of Aeschylus, of
whose meaning Aristophanes could doubt (Ran. 920 foll.), although in
the latter case the attempt is justified by frequent and manifest corruptions.
</p><p>
How many conjectural alterations of Shakspeare have been
exploded through closer study of Elizabethan English! How few,
comparatively speaking, have been established! And yet they were
mostly the inventions of ingenious Englishmen, sometimes of poets,
whose mother tongue was that of Shakspeare, and who had known
Shakspeare all their lives. How much <gloss>farther off,</gloss> as Plato would
say, the most accomplished foreigner must necessarily appear in such
an endeavour, may be roughly measured by comparing two wrong
readings, that of 'physician' for 'precisian' in M. W. W. 2, 1, which
Dyce adopted, and <gloss>he smote his leaded pole-axe on the ice,</gloss> which
a good German critic has suggested as an <term>emendation</term> of Ham. 1, 12. Neither of these conjectures is true; but which of them is more
like truth no Englishman can for a moment doubt. And there is a
<pb n="107"/>

difference not less wide between such corrections as Boeckh's φονώ-
σαισιν for φοινίαισιν in Ant. 118, or Arndt's εὐνάτειρα for θυγάτηρ in Ο. Τ. 1112, and scores of other conjectures that have been made in either
play.

<p>
There must still always be a degree of uncertainty in defending
MS. readings of the tenth century, because our general conception of
what is likely (the 'veri simile' of Lachmann) is based on the whole
text which is the subject of dispute. But the close and analytical
study of that text may, at least, enable us to reject proposed emendations,
which, although not without plausibility on palaeographical,
metrical, grammatical, and other technical grounds, may safely be
pronounced alien to Sophocles, either as not poetical, or not idiomatic,
or as interfering with the natural emphasis and rhythm, or as
out of harmony with the context. Mistrust is not unreasonable,
when such obvious rhetorical effects as the hesitation of Deianira,
and the pleading iteration of Philoctetes, are found to be persistently
ignored. We are often justified in saying, Sophocles may have
written what we find: he cannot have written what is proposed
instead. It has not the Sophoclean colouring; it is like a raw touch
on a picture ill-restored.

One object of this Essay will have been served, if it should be found
to have contributed anything towards supplying the desideratum which
is here indicated.

In the foregoing pages I have not taken account of differences in
point of language between the several Plays. Such differences exist,
but are scarcely marked enough to be exhibited in a tabular form.
</p><p>
It may be well, however, to remind the student who desires to
pursue this subject, that the order of the Plays, which is followed
for convenience in this edition, is not that of their production. The
Oedipus Coloneus, if not the last of the seven, is probably much later
than either the Antigone or the Oedipus Rex, and has been thought
to share with the Philoctetes, and in a measure also with the Trachiniae,
some traces of an altered manner, in which the popular influences,
which were so powerful with Euripides, were not without their effect.
</p><p>
The language of the Oedipus Rex is the most highly wrought, while
that of the Electra is the simplest. The Antigone, rivalling the Oedipus
Rex in energy, has far more directness of expression. The Philoctetes
is marked by studied ease and vernacular freedom, reminding the
English reader of those poems of Shelley-such as Julian and Maddalo-in
which, without losing poetical grace and finish, he reflects
the tone of actual conversation. The Ajax approaches the most nearly
to an Epic manner, and displays a peculiar fulness in the utterance
of passionate feeling. The Trachiniae is pervaded by a singular
tenderness and delicacy. The difference of style between the dialogue
and the lyrical portions is most marked in the Oedipus Coloneus.</p>
