    <p>Before the dialogue begins, the suppliants
are seen to enter on the spectator's
right, with wool-wreathed olivewands
in their left hands (Aesch. Suppl.
193). Marshalled by the Priests, they
eagerly approach the altars, on the steps
of which they lay their wands (Ib. 242).
Before this movement is completed,
Oedipus enters to them by the central
door. There was probably at least one
altar on either side of this, that of Apollo
Lycaeus (1.919) being one, and the
approach of Creon, who comes from the
country, would be seen by those on the
spectator's left (11. 78, 9), before becoming
visible to Oedipus or to the Priest
of Zeus, who remains on the right.

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1">
<p><lem>Ω τέκνα .. τροφή</lem>
Oedipus addresses
the Thebans as the strangerprince,
who will soon be discovered
to belong to the race which he governs.

his foreign origin, and see infr. 452, 3,

<p><lem>τροφή,</lem> 'objects of my care,' expressing

Oedipus for his children; a rare use of

children who are my care.'
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="2"><p><lem>μοι</lem> is 'precatory,' adding a tone of
pleading affectionateness to the question.
Cp. Εl. 144, τί μοι τῶν δυσφόρων ἐφίει;
τίνας . . ἕδρας τάσδε.. θοάζετε = 'Why
do ye thus sit (or kneel) here with so
much haste?' The king in entering has
observed (or before entering has heard
from others, 11. 6, 7) the earnestness
with which the suppliants have taken
their places by the altars, and he regards
this as one of the signs of trouble in the
city. The meaning here given to θοάζω
is that which it has everywhere in Euripides,
who uses it frequently. Another
θοάζω = θάσσω is mentioned by grammarians,
and has been generally assumed to
be the verb found in this and two other
places of classical Greek, viz. Aesch.
Suppl. 595, Emped. 1. 18. But it is at
least questionable whether the meaning
'to hasten' is not admissible in both of
these. And in the present case it is unobjectionable.
For however slow and
staid the movements on the proscenium
actually were, they are often described
in the dialogue as rapid and hurried.
(El. 872, O. C. 887.) Cp. esp. Aesch.
Suppl. 209, μή νυν σχόλαζε, addressed
by Danaus to the suppliant maidens,
who are taking their places at the altar.
It must be admitted, however, that the
authority of Plutarch (de Aud. Poet. 2.
22 E) counts for something in favour
of the other meaning, and that it suits
the context equally well.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="3">
<p>Instead of saying simply 'equipped
with suppliant boughs,' the more

ἀργυρωθέντες σὺν οἰνηραῖς φιάλαις. ἐξεστεμμένοι, i. e. στέμμασιν ἐξεσταλμένοι,
Well provided with woollen wreaths.'

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="4">
<p><lem>πόλις δ΄</lem>
The form of interrogation
is dropped. The pleonastic ἄλλων, ('who
are not myself,') in apposition to ἀγγέ
λων, makes the antithesis more explicit.
Cp. Eur. Or. 532, τί μαρτύρων | ἄλλων
ἀκούειν δεῖ μ᾽, ἅ γ᾽ εἰσορᾶν πάρα; Hdt. 7. 50, εἰ μὴ χρεώμενοι γνώμῃσι τοιαύτῃσι

<p>The expression is slightly inaccurate.
Oedipus begins with the antithesis
of what is seen and heard, and
the further antithesis (between the signs

of incense, and of groanings which

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="10"><p><lem>τίνι τρόπῳ καθέστατε</lem> means not
merely, 'How are you?' but, <gloss>In what

the priest and his companions,
who are evidently there to crave an
audience. The exact word for this is
καθεστάναι. Cp. Pind. Pyth. 4. 135, καί
β᾽ ἦλθον Πελίου μέγαρον, ἐσσύμενοι δ᾽
εἴσω κατέσταν: Hdt. 1. 152, καταστάς,
ἔλεγε πολλά. Also κατάστασις in Hdt.
3.46. (Trin. gl. ἐπεστήκατε.) The 1st
pers. in προσήμεθα 1. 15, ἑζόμεσθα 1. 32,
ἱστώμεσθα 1. 147, does not necessarily
imply that the priest spoke in the attitude
of supplication. But on comparing
Aesch. Suppl. 208, Eur. Heracl. 238,
this does seem possible, and might add
to the apparent greatness of Oedipus.
For καθέστατε in this case, cр. О. С. 23,
κατέσταμεν, where Oedipus is sitting.

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="11">
<p><lem>δείσαντες ἢ στέρξαντες</lem> στέ
ξαντες, which appears in some later
MSS, but not in all, and as a very late
correction of L, was perhaps invented
to suit the gloss, ὑπομείναντές τι κακόν,
a late meaning of στέγειν being 'to endure.'
Cp. gloss in Par. E. on 1. 341,
στέγω ὑπομένω, ἔστεξα is not an Attic
form. στέρξαντες is right in the sense
of desiring or having the affections fixed
on something. Cp. O. C. 1094, στέργω

here? in consequence of what fear? or
of what desire?</gloss> i.e. 'What desire

of the interrogative is continued in the
<pb n="139"/>
participles. στέρξαντες is quoted by
the Scholiast, who interprets, οἷον, ἤδη
πεπονθότες. But Oedipus asks, not,
'Is the evil present or past?'-that
some blow had fallen was clear-but,
What is the feeling with which you
come?' Others connect ὡς, κ.τ.λ., immediately
with στέρξαντες in the sense
of 'being resigned.' 'Having made up
your minds to suffer, in the belief that,
etc.' But although this interpretation
gives the more ordinary meaning to
στέρξαντες, it has the capital fault of
making Oedipus express his main assurance
to the people in a parenthesis,
or in a suppressed clause. ὡς refers to
φράζε, <gloss>Tell me, and believe, etc.</gloss>

i. e. ετε without elision), and is of
doubtful meaning, though it may
slightly be confirmed by Ant. 790, οὔθ'

most probably been occasioned by the
form 66 for ετε (in οἱ δέ τε), which
the corrector altered for the sake of
dividing the words. The word λεκτοί
at the beginning of the line (cp. Homer),

Oedipus is still unconsciously drawing
the attention of the spectators to his
own part in the business. The person
to be avenged is his father, and he is
himself the author of the pollution, in
which he has so deep an interest
(αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ μύσος is suggested, though
not said), and of the crime which he
may one day wreak upon himself. For

the same word though in a different

to the use of τιμωρεῖν here. But the
word is not inappropriate the murderer
may be supposed to have a grudge
against the crown-and by using it
Oedipus suggests the end, when he, the
murderer, shall inflict vengeance on
himself, the king, with the same hand
that had slain Laius. The conjecture
πημαίνειν is therefore not in point.
The words also prepare the way for
what follows, by betraying the first rise
of the feeling of suspicion in Oedipus

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="151-215"><p> Outstretched in fear we
listen awfully for thy propitious voice,
oh sweet-tongued utterance of Heaven.
Paean, be our speed! What thing new
or old in season due dost thou disclose?
Tell us, thou voice, child of bright Hope
divine. Athena, Goddess, daughter of
the Highest, first hear our cry; thou,
Artemis, on thine encircled throne,
and archer Phoebus, come in threefold
might to save! if ever heretofore
ye banished sorrow from our state,
now too appear! For, oh! I am overwhelmed;
all my host is in disarray;
and there is no thought to save; Earth's
buds are nipped, and human births prevented
by the pains of death: soul after
soul takes flight with fearful speed, and
poor uncared-for corpses choke with
pestilence our unpeopled clime.
Wives, mothers, sadly suppliant, at
various altars groan; the voice of lamentation
mingles with the thrilling
hymn. Athena, send us help. and cause
yon flaming author of destruction, who
with dire noise advances, quickly to reverse
his speed and fly our land, whether
to Ocean or the restless Pontic sea.
Day ruins what night spares. O Father,
blast the plague-god with thy lightning.
Let thine arrows, O Apollo, be showered
to protect us, and Artemis' bright
torches from the Lycian hills; and thou,
O ruddy crowned Bacchus of the joyous
rout, with trooping Maenads, patron of
Thebes, draw near. and flash thy brand
against the god whom gods disown.'
The opening of this parodos is of the
nature of a paean (1. 186), or hymn to
Apollo as the god of victory or salvation.
The stately dactylic measures,
corresponding in strophe and antistrophe
even to the division of the words (cp.
153, 162, 158, 166), are only once interrupted,
as the chorus march towards
the altar, by the more meditative iambic
rhythm (11. 152, 160), and by the
anacrusis in 11. 154, 163.
The increasing excitement of the
chorus is shown in the second strophe
and antistrophe, by iambic and trochaic
rhythms with resolution of the arsis,
by the union of dactyls and trochees in
logaoedic lines, and by the more frequent
anacruses. The bright Paean
<pb n="152"/>
notes give way to tones of sadness,
echoing the στονόεσσα γήρυς (11. 186, 7).
The scheme of στρ. and ἀντ. β'. is the

In the concluding strophe and antistrophe
(γ'.) there is only one dactylic
line, just as there was one iambic in the
first. The other rhythms are iambic
and trochaic, with occasional syncope
of the thesis (or change to the cretic
rhythm). The movement, though still
full of excitement, becomes more energetic
and determined towards the
close. The scansion is as follows:-

The rhythm of the whole ode, which

shows a progress from flowing dactylic
numbers to iambics and trochaics, which
are interrupted here and there by syncope
of the thesis, or in other words,
by an antispastic effect, corresponding to
the distraction of the thought.</p>

See Essay on L. p. 90, and cp. Tr. 467,

It has been objected to this interpretation
that οὐ γὰρ ἄν necessarily means,
'Else had I not,' (sc. εἰ μὴ ξένος ἦν).
Cp. infr. 11. 318, 1456, 7. But no such
rule is absolute in tragic Greek, and no
tenable interpretation has been based
on this way of taking the words. The
'suppressed clause' is εἰ ἴχνευον, and
the general meaning is 'I could not be
otherwise than a stranger.' Although
the more usual mode of connexion would
be πῶς γὰρ-; the negative form, οὐ

i. e. If the disk were not full, which

something to guide me, and I had nothing.'
The word σύμβολον (for which
see Ar. Pol. 4. 7, Pind. Ol. 12. 7), would
cause a thrill of horror to the spectators,
when they reflected that Oedipus had
Laius' blood upon his hand, and the

The subject is changed from 'anyone

Some obscurity also arises from the
appeal to fear (cp. infr. 234, 294) being
combined with the attempt to soothe
it (cp. Τr. 457, κεὶ μὲν δέδοικας, οὐ καλῶς
ταρβεῖς).
μέν in 227 points to the opposite supposition:-'he

penalty, but shall be unmolested in his
departure from the land.'
i. e. Instead of waiting for others to
convict him, let him convict himself by
going into voluntary exile, and taking
the offence from the land. The words
καθ' αὑτοῦ are to be construed κατὰ
σύνεσιν with 1. 226, sc. ποιείτω τάδε,
self-banishment being in this case equivalent
to self-impeachment :-
Let

the guilt away.</p>
<p><lem>Οι (3) ὑπεξελών</lem> is to be taken in the
unusual sense of 'drawing forth from
concealment.' 'Let him obey me by
divulging the crime against himself.'
The last interpretation (3) is the simplest
(cp. Pind. N. 4. 8); but the first
(1) is on the whole the most probable.

the supposed self-convicted criminal is
contrasted with the fierceness of his

And some one resident in Thebes
might be a fellow countryman of the
'stranger-robbers' (1. 715), who had
killed Laius in the triple way. The
obscurity of expression arises from the
effort to adapt the language to the case
of Oedipus. The οἰκέτης was in the
position of knowing another from another
land. Contrast 11. 231, 2, with

<p>The formality of the language

Some editors, following Ribbeck, have
placed these lines after 1. 272, on the
ground that the plural τοῖσδε in the
words ἅπερ τοῖσδ᾽ ἀρτίως ἠρασάμην, has
no proper antecedent, for Oedipus is

<pb n="162"/>
speaking of one murderer not of many;
and they would suppose the error to
have been caused by the recurrence of
ὑμῖν δὲ in 1. 273. But the plural, referring
to some 'person or persons unknown,'
is sufficiently justified by εἴτε
πλειόνων μέτα, and for the vague reference
of the pronoun ὅde, see Essay on
L. § 22. p. 34. Oedipus is careless
about the number; cp. supr. 107, 124
and note. The curse also falls indirectly
on those who disobey the commands in
11. 224-32, and 236-41. A slight inaccuracy
of language is no sufficient reason
for such a transposition. The conjecture
requires a further conjecture: ie. the
words must (1) have been omitted, then
(2) have been written in the margin,
and then (3) must have been wrongly
inserted before ὑμῖν δέ, <ref>l. 252</ref>, instead of
before ὑμῖν δέ, <ref>l. 273</ref>. It may be observed,
in defence of the existing text,
that the curse on the malefactor naturally
precedes the curse on those who
disobey the edict. The emphasis is on
κατεύχομαι. τὸν δεδρακότα is added
instead of a pronoun, referring to τὸν
ἄνδρα τοῦτον, because of τῷ δαίμονι and
τῷ θανόντι coming between. The words
ἅπερ .. ἠρασάμην include 11. 236 ff.

The differing metres of the first and

the eager resolution of the chorus to
find the murderer, with the wavering
excitement which the words of Teiresias
have awakened, distracting them between
their loyalty to Oedipus and their
reverence for the seer. The first strophe
commences with a strain half grave, half
light, which is stirred into a quicker
motion in the glyconics (lines 466-8),
where the flight of the fugitive is described

624-625. The text of these lines is probably
defective. Two things seem clear;
(1) that line 625 is more appropriate
to Creon than to Oedipus, <gloss>You speak
as if you would not relent nor believe
me.</gloss> (MS. Farn. had upe. before this
line by p. m.) Cp. infr. 646, πίστευσον, Οἰδίπους, τάδε: 650, τί σοὶ θέλεις
δῆτ᾽ εἰκάθω; Αj. 371, ὦ πρὸς θεῶν ὕπεικε
καὶ φρόνησον εὖ: and (2) that line 624
is addressed by Oedipus to Creon, and
conveys a threat: 'When you have
given an example of the crime of envy.'
Cp. Ant. 308, πρὶν ἂν | ζῶντες κρεμαστοὶ
τήνδε δηλώσηθ ὕβριν: ib. 325, 6, έξερεῖθ᾽ ὅτι | τὰ δειλὰ κέρδη πημονὰς ἐργάζεται: Τr. 1110, 11, ἵν᾽ ἐκδιδαχθῇ πᾶσιν

ἀνδρὶ πρόσκειται κακόν (ⅰ.e. προδείξας οἷόν
ἐστι τὸ κακῶς βουλεύειν) : Pind. P. 2. 42.
By transposing 624, 5, as Haase suggested,
a kind of meaning may be
brought out. <gloss>My desire for you is
death, not banishment.</gloss> 'You speak
as if you would not relent.' 'I will
relent when you are made an example
of the sin of envy' (and not before).
'(My envy is) that I see you to be unwise.'
But the transitions are too
violent. Again, 623, 4, may be read
continuously, and the loss of a single
line supposed after 625. <gloss>I would
have you be (not banished but) slain,
when you have first been made an example
of the crime of envy (in the
manner of your death).</gloss> 'You speak as
if you would not relent nor believe me.'
['And you speak like a rebel.'] 'Because
I see you blind.' But the insertion
(διὰ μέσου) οἱ οὐ φυγεῖν, and the
abruptness of ὅταν προδείξῃς, may be
thought to prevent the two lines from
coalescing into a harmonious sentence.
In this case the most probable inference
would be that one or more lines have
been lost before 624 and after 625.
The old explanations of the Scholiast,
When you have shown the nature of
the grudge I bear you,' sc. oἷός ἐστιν ὁ
ἐμὸς πρὸς σὲ φθόνος (cp. supr. 605 ff.),
or of Hermann, 'When you have shown
the nature of your grudge against me,'
or of the ancient gloss, When you have
first explained:-oh! what a thing envy
is!' are untenable, especially because
they afford no natural explanation of

as a citizen (cp. Ant. 737, πόλις γὰρ
οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ἥτις ἀνδρός ἐσθ᾽ ἑνός), but as the
brother of the queen, whose right was
prior to that of Oedipus himself. Cp. 577-581. Oedipus appeals to his loyal
citizens against the insubordination of
Creon, who replies that he also has a
right in the state. As his temper rises,
he no longer acknowledges that he owes
his influence to Oedipus. The disadvantage
under which Oedipus labours,
as the stranger prince,' is subtly maintained
throughout. The chorus interpose
in their character of mediator, not
to take part with either disputant, but
to appease the strife.

There are two objections to this line on

monosyllable, the only parallel to which
in Greek tragic verse is Ἐρινννων, in
Iph. Taur. 970, 1456. (See, however,
Hes. Scut. 3, Ἠλεκτρύωνος: cp. ib. 16.)
The two metrical exceptions are singular.
But it is not likely that the
verse is corrupt. No interpolator would
have introduced a word so rare in

later Greek as ἀποκρίνας in this sense.

Critics have noticed what was hardly

The other explanation: 'You are dangerous

grounds-(1) because presenting a mere
repetition under the form of antithesis;
(2) because θυμοῦ περᾶν, in the sense of
'to pass out of anger,' is too harsh for
Sophocles. Also (3) because some Greek

The urgency of the request (ἐξικέτευσε,

The interpretation of the Scholiast

The latter, however, is nearer to the MSS.,

his deserts towards her exceeded those of
common service; thus unconsciously recalling
the peculiar trust she had once
reposed in him. Cp. 1. 1173, and see
Arist. Poet. 1454. The readings ὃ δ'

though in harmony with feelings suggested
by the dramatic situation, is
almost wholly lyrical. The second antistrophe
returns to the circumstances of
the drama, but in the earlier stanzas the
thought of the impiety of the King and
Queen is lost in the reflections which it
has awakened. This is in so far dramatically
appropriate, as the chorus
could not openly express their censure.

the love of purity and abhorrence of
unholiness which are here expressed
suggest the leading motive' of the
whole tragedy. See Introduction. This
ode is composed of iambic, trochaic,
and dactylic measures, of which the iambic
and dactylic predominate in the
first strophe and antistrophe, and the
trochaic in the second. The stateliness
of the movement in the first strophe and
antistrophe is shown by the prevalence
of the heavy trochee and epitritus
(------), and generally
by the frequency of long syllables.
This effect is, however, lightened in the
fourth and fifth lines by the resolution of
a long syllable in the opening dipodia
of each.

2nd stasimon. 'May I never break
the sanctity of the unwritten laws! Heaven-born,
they live and move on high,
and are not made by man, nor shall they
ever sleep or be forgotten. In them is a
Divine power which grows not old.
How dangerous is pride; which heaves
men high and dashes them below, to
depths in which no foot may stir. Not
so the noble ardour for the city's weal,
which may God, who protects me, still
uphold! But may an evil fate overtake
the proud impious one, who tramples
on justice and profanes holy things.
How can he escape from vengeance?
For if actions like his are honourable,
what means my service in the dance?
No longer will I worship unless the
oracles be even now justified in the
sight of men. But, O Zeus, thy power
fails not; let thine eye behold the contempt
which they are pouring on things
Divine. For they heed not the oracles
of Laius, and pay no honour to Apollo.'
863 foll. May I ever keep a holy
purity, in all words and acts for which
there are laws established on high, children
of the sky, of whom Olympus is the
only sire.' The participle φέροντι,

gives the notion of simultaneousness :
;
May my lot be with me in keeping,'
i.e. May it ever be my lot to keep. Cp.

    <p><lem>τίς ἔτι ποτ᾿ ἐν τοῖσδ᾽ ἀνὴρ

<pb n="212"/>
passage is printed as it is written in L.
If we are contented with adopting
θυμοῦ, the meaning will be, <gloss>Who in
such courses can go on to avert the
darts of wrath and ward them from
his soul?</gloss> i. e. What tyrant can avoid
becoming an object of anger? Or, according
to some interpreters, <gloss>Who,
where such things are done, can avoid
being angry?</gloss> But neither meaning is
satisfactory, and the epexegesis, 4. a., is
tame and awkward. ἔρξεται may have
crept in from above. Either here or in
infra 1. 906 there must be some corruption
of the text, as the words θυμοῦ
βέλη have nothing corresponding to
them in the antistrophe, unless the interlinear
gloss παλαιά is supposed to be
a corruption of παλαίφατα, or some such
word. Hermann, in suggesting to omit
ἔρξεται and read θεῶν for θυμῶι (i. e.
θῶμ for θιμῶι), supposing the line φθίνοντα γὰρ Λαΐου to be complete, gave an
impossible emphasis to ἀνήρ. <gloss>Who in
such a course is man enough to ward
from his soul the darts of Heaven?</gloss>
Two modifications of this have been
suggested, (1) reading ἀμύνοι for ἀμύνειν (cp. Ant. 635, τίς.. κατάσχοι);
Who, in following such a course, can
continue to ward off the arrows of the
Gods?' (2) Supposing the metre to be
as in the text, with Λαΐου παλαίφατα in
the antistrophe, τίς ἔτι ποτ᾽ ἐν τοῖσδ᾽
ἀνὴρ θυμῷ βάλοι θεῶν βέληψυχᾶς ἀμύνειν;
Who then can imagine how to ward
from his soul the weapons of the Gods?'
The former (1) is preferable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="895-896"><p><gloss>For if honour attend such
actions, what need have I to lead the
sacred dance?</gloss> If <gloss>the righteous are as

judged in the time of the plague, it is
ἐν ὁμοίῳ καὶ σέβειν καὶ μή (Thuc. 2. 53).
This thought changes the mood of the
chorus, who for the moment catch the
infection of doubt (as previously they
doubted Teiresias), here as elsewhere
reflecting opposite and conflicting tendencies.
They soon, however, renew
the strain of piety (899, cp. 480), and
appeal to the supreme power of Zeus.

in the worship of Dionysus is in keeping

911, foll. A way has been prepared
by which the truth shall be revealed
when it seems furthest from the thoughts
of the king and queen. The messenger
who brings from Corinth the welcome

meeting brings the whole to light. Jocasta
still keeps her confidence, but cannot
be unaffected by the mood of Oedipus,

fear. She is preparing to supplicate the

more probable, has been substituted.

This correction, which
Elmsley made from conjecture, is found

between the insignificant station

Oedipus. The reading of L. and most
MSS. σοῦ γ'.. σωτήρ γε was, however,

That wrings mine eyes to 't.' The question
is suggested to Oedipus by the word
σωτήρ; i. e. ‘From what pain that I
was suffering in my misfortunes did you
rescue me?' but is introduced by the
poet, as the Scholiast properly observes,
in order to lead to the mention of the
personal mark (compare the scar of
Ulysses in the Odyssey) by which the
conviction of the truth is brought home
to Jocasta. In his eagerness to 'delve
to the root' the mystery of his birth,
Oedipus is wholly unconscious of the
effect which the successive answers have

upon the mind of the queen-the horror
of whose discovery is the chief interest
of this part of the play, and who may
be supposed to remain immoveable until
her outbreak in 1. 1056. The same
explanation applies to 1. 1037, which
adds poignancy to the stroke.

Cp. Plat. Legg. 11,
916 B. where ἐκμήνου for ἑκμήνου is in
Par. A, Hes. Op. 566, 608. There can be
no doubt that this is the true reading,
though based on inferior MS. authority.
It was adopted by Porson from the Trin.
MS. and is confirmed by three others
(including Ven. 617 pr.) 'Three entire
seasons of six months extending from
spring to the rising of Arcturus.' It has
been proposed (by E. A. J. Ahrens in
Philologus of 1876) to explain the Laurentian
reading thus: τρεῖς ὅλους
ἐμμήνους χρόνους, 'three full months,
being the time from spring to the rising
of Arcturus:' and it is urged in favour
(a)
χειμῶνι EV3 Vat. ac.</p>
<p><lem>τούτων</lem> CA.
of this that spring is late in visiting
the Boeotian Highlands. But the awkwardness
of the parenthesis, coming
between the numeral and the noun, and
the unmeaning pleonasm, are fatal objections
to this way of taking the words.
The division of the year κατὰ θέρος καὶ
χειμώνα, into equal periods of six months,
is also more probable. And the imperfect
ἤλαυνον shows that the shepherd is
speaking of what he did not once but
habitually.

In the description which follows, Jocasta
is seen first passing through the
hall or peristyle to the inner chamber,
which she enters and closes the doors
after her. Then in cries which resound
through the hall (while she remains
unseen of any one), she calls the spirit
of Laius to witness the horrors consequent
on their nuptial. The household
would have followed her, but their
attention is arrested by the entrance of
Oedipus: who ranges through the hall
with loud cries, calling for a weapon,
and for the mother-wife. The sound of
his approach precipitates the fatal purpose
of the queen, who hangs herself in
the chamber. Suddenly Oedipus bethinks
him that she is there, and with
a single effort, he bursts open the bolted
doors. He undoes the noose by which she
is hanging, and when she is fallen dead,
he pulls the buckles from her garments
and dashes the points into his eyes.

<p><lem>οὗ καιρὸς ἀεὶ ζῇν, κ.τ.λ.</lem>
Dindorf's
correction of this line, by substituting
lâ for deí, while retaining τοῦ, is
objectionable on many grounds: (1)
The crasis of da, the third singular indicative
or subjunctive, is not sufficiently
supported in a conjectural reading by
the single instance in Homer, Il. 5. 256,
τρεῖν μ᾽ οὐκ ἐᾷ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη: (2) καιρός
(sc. ἐστιν) is a common idiom, and is
good sense, while οὗ καιρὸς ἐᾷ is neither:
(3) the insertion of the article is a
more likely error than the corruption of
a verb. Meineke's οὗ καιρὸς ή ζην is
better. But the article τοῦ has no special
force, and may have come either from a
gloss or from immediately below; and
the emphatic del suits well with the
feeling of Oedipus, who is thinking of
the unhappy circumstances of his own
life. The pause at the middle of the
line is not frequent. but there are several
examples of such a division, after a strong
monosyllable like ζῆν, in the present play.

and to ὃν τις οὐ ζήλῳ πολιτῶν τῆς τύχης

difficulty is to suppose that a line following
this one has been lost. Who
did not' (after the manner of tyrants)
[maintain his power] 'by envy of the
citizens and by keeping an eye upon
their fortunes; i. e. Oedipus was a wise
and popular ruler, not like Thrasybulus
or Periander, who cut off the tallest
heads of grain. Cp Pind. Pyth. 3. 71,
πραὺς ἀστοῖς, οὐ φθονέων ἀγαθοῖς. But
the transition from the dative to the
participle is harsh; and ζῆλοs is not
φθόνος. The reading of VM, ἐν for
οὐ, and the gloss ἐπαιρόμενοs in ME,
suggest a different line of conjecture, viz.
that some other verb is concealed in
ἐπιβλέπων. ἐπιφλέγων would harmonize
well with κλύδωνα in the following
line, both together suggesting an image
of brightness quenched. Cp. Aesch. S.
c. Τ. 772, τίν᾿ ἀνδρῶν γὰρ τοσόνδ᾽ ἐθαύμασαν θεοὶ καὶ ξυνέστιοι πόλεος, κ τ.λ.:
Ib. 758, κακῶν δ᾽ ὥσπερ θάλασσα κῦμ᾿

The Naples MS. No. 291 (II. F. 34),
(quoted by Elmsley as Farn.'), has
τ/ἐπιβλέπων. There still remains the awkwardness of ὅστις with the participle.
The emendation above attempted removes
this: but is no doubt only one
of several possible expedients. IP may
have been lost after ἀνήρ (ΗΡΠΡ); and
the remaining letters of πρῶτος, ΟΤΟΣ,
might then be changed to ὅστις; cp.
supr. 478 (ὁτ.-ώστ.), Ο. C. 775 (τισ

τo εὐδαιμονία, cp. esp. Aj. 503, οίας λατρείας ἀνθ᾽ ὅσου ζήλου τρέφει: Thuc. 2.

ΙΙ. 10, τέλος δωδεκάμηνον περάσαι σὺν

rhythm, here (1515 foll.) preparing for
and hastening the exit of the chief
actor, affords relief to the mind of the
spectator after the long strain of excited
feeling. The comparative tameness of
the concluding lines (wrongly assigned
to Oed. by the Schol., who was thinking
of the Phoenissae) is in accordance with
this. The lines in the Phoenissae read
like an imitation of this passage, which,
although beneath the general style of

concluding words of the chorus in the

mixed thought; Oedipus expressing in

in speech or writing, and especially
one giving direction at a critical moment.
Oedipus is thinking of the language
of the oracles which he remembers.
Cp. Trach. 157, δέλτον ἐγγεγραμμένην |
ξυνθήματ'. Whether the notion of 'comprising
much in little' belongs to the
word accidentally, or is assisted by some
association from συντιθέναι (Εl. 673, ἐν
βραχεῖ συνθεὶς λέγω), is not easy to determine.
Cp. inf. 586, ἀλλ' ἐν βραχεῖ

means that in praying the dread goddesses
to receive him to rest finally in
Attica, he is uttering the word which

Eur. Or. 140-207, Ion 184-236, Heracl.
73-83, where there is a similar interchange
of lyrical measures between the
chief actor on the stage and the chorus
on their first entrance. The commatic
parodos' of the Electra, 11. 121-250, is
more regular in structure, and is rather
<pb n="298"/>
to be compared with Aj. 201-262, Aesch.
Prom. 114-192, Eur. Med. 131-212, etc.
As in other places where the part
assigned to the chorus is much broken,
it has been attempted to distribute it
amongst the fifteen choreutae, who are
supposed to speak one at a time. But
although some such arrangement is
probable in itself and confirmed by
the comparison of other passages, such
as Aj. 866-960. El. 823-870, Trach.
871-895, it is impossible to determine
the details of it with any approach to
certainty. For instance whether 11. 117-137, 149-169, were chanted by ἡμιχόρια,
(the asyndeta giving the effect of doubt
amidst eager search), or divided amongst
several persons, or in what order the
individual members of the chorus took
part, are questions which may be asked
but not answered. Ll. 176, 7, 203-6,
229-36, may be assigned with some
probability to the Coryphaeus. See
Hermann's notes.
It is also uncertain how far an antistrophic
arrangement of the metres is
to be maintained. Thus 11. 117-137
clearly correspond to 11. 149-169. But
the anapaestic movement, 11. 138-148,
is not exactly answered by 11. 170-177:
cp. Eur. Ion 227-9: and, while 11. 178-181, 184-187, severally correspond
(though in the MSS. not perfectly) to
194-8, 203-6, there is again a want of
correspondence between 11. 182, 3, and
199-202. Although these are not anapaestic
measures, it may be observed
that they accompany movements of Oedipus,
which, if they were to be represented
at all naturally, were necessarily
interrupted and irregular, and while it
is of course possible that some lines
have been lost after 183, it is also conceivable
that there may have been an
interval of silence, or that a pause in the
dialogue may have been filled up with
instrumental music. Cp. infr. 1692 ff.
and note, Phil. 1170 1217. However
this may have been, the correction ἡσυχαίᾳ, which brings 1. 197 into accordance
with 182, is probably right.
The long passage 207-254, which
may be regarded as a double epode, is
even less regular, the rhythm changing
several times with the situation. But
the similarity of 207 ff. to 237 ff., which
led Hermann to arrange this passage
also antistrophically, suggests the idea
of a strain which after being interrupted
is again renewed. And the dactylic measures
of the chorus (229 ff.) are resumed,
though with a difference, in the supplication
of Antigone (241 ff.).
The prevailing metre is logaoedic, with
free anapaestic systems coming between.
But 11. 212-15, where a fresh cause of
agitation arises, are Ionic a minore;
and the passage which follows presents
a curious alternation of single paroemiacs
with
The concluding lines, 229 ff., contain a
series of rapid dactylic measures modified
with an occasional glyconic or
iambic rhythm.
The following lines have been objected
to for metrical reasons as they are
found in the MS. text, 117, 121, 2, 3,
134 or 166, 152, 156, 175, 178, 182, 3,
(or 197-202), 205, 212, 220, 226, 247,
252.
The difficulties will be dealt with as
they occur. But it may be remarked at
the outset that the divergences from an
antistrophic structure which have been
noticed above cannot justify what is in
itself unmetrical. At the same time
the variation between CIK
and cc, c c − (134-166) or between
Icchci and
Aclcclc- (182-197),
the shortening of the diphthong in
ναίει (cp. γεραιός), or admission of an irrational
thesis (117), and the resolution
of the long syllable of an anapaest or
dactyl as in 220, although they may
be rejected on special grounds in particular
places, are not to be absolutely
condemned. Lastly, in dealing with
metrical irregularities in the lyrical part
of plays which like the O. C. and Phil.
belong to the latest period of Greek
tragedy, we are haunted by the doubt
whether the changes in music which
began about this time were not already
accompanied with metrical innovations.
In the presence of manifest corruptions,
like that in 1. 152, we cannot firmly
maintain that it was so; yet the fact
remains that the metrical anomalies in
the text of these two plays greatly exceed
the average of corruptions in Sophocles.

The pleading glyconic rhythms of
1. 207 ff., which were broken off by the
discovery of Oedipus, are here renewed,
and as they proceed are mingled with a
rapid dactylic strain, which meets the
impetuosity of the chorus in 1. 229 ff.
with corresponding earnestness. This
combined movement has given rise to
some doubt, and, in order to keep the
dactylic verse continuous, some would
read in 247, ἐν ὑμῖν ὡς θεῷ, οι ἐν ὕμμι
γὰρ ὡς θεῷ, and in 252, with Triclinius,
οὐ γὰρ ἴδοις ἂν ἀθρῶν βροτόν. But the
syncopated thesis and change of rhythm
in both places, as in ll. 7, 14, may give
the effect of lingering earnestness (τὸ
λιπαρές) combined with the eagerness of
her supplication. On the other hand
the slight alteration of the last two
lines, approved by Hermann, appears
probable on comparing 11. 235, 6. The
MS. reading of 253 may be scanned
Cp. infr. 1676, 1703.
In comparing this passage with El.
236-50 on the one hand, and on the
other with Phil. 1170-1217, Eur. Or.
1452-1503, we seem to trace the increasing
use of monostrophic μέλη
ἀπὸ σκηνῆς. From the Aj., Ant., O. T.,
Trach. this phenomenon is absent, except
in such short epodes as Ant. 876-81, ἄκλαυτος, ἄφιλος .. οὐδεὶς φίλων
στενάζει.
In the scheme of metres on pp. 301, 2,
it has been thought better not to divide
the strophes into parts. Their structure
will be sufficiently evident to the
student, although a sharp division between
the main portion of each, and
the prelude or conclusion, can hardly be
maintained.

are simply bent on defending the sacred
precinct which is entrusted to their

after the final appeal of Oedipus, who
professes himself the saviour of Athens,
they own that the matter is too hard

so that even had I done it knowingly,
I should not have been guilty. But as
it was, I went all unwittingly on my path
of woe, whereas those who planned
my destruction knew well what they
were doing.' The imperfect tense in
ἀπωλλύμην expresses an intention not
carried into effect (as in διδόναι, κτείνειν, etc.). Cp. Thuc. 3. 57, οἵτινες
Μήδων τε κρατησάντων ἀπωλλύμεθα. The
words παθών .. ἀντέδρων refer to the
parricide: but it is doubtful whether
παθών means simply 'in self defence,'
or contains an allusion to his father's
act in preparing the destruction of his
infant. Similarly it is doubtful whether
1. 274 applies to Creon and his sons, or
again to his parents. There may seem
to be a certain harshness in supposing
Oedipus to speak thus of Laius,
and the tone of 521 ff., 985 ff. is certainly
different. Yet this is the most
obvious interpretation of the present
passage, and receives some confirmation
from O. Τ. 718, 9, 1454, ἵν'
ἐξ ἐκείνων, οἵ μ᾿ ἀπωλλύτην, θάνω. The
peace of Oedipus does not include forgiveness
of those who have wronged

Some editors have attempted, reading
μοῖραν, as in the early recension, or μοίpas,
which is found in two MSS, to
render, Do not, while ye honour the
Gods suppose them to be fates' (or 'a
fate'). By no means,' etc. But this
sharp distinction between God and Fate
belongs to a much later age. Sophocles
would no more have spoken irreverently
of the μοίραι than of the other
deities. And the interpretation has no
meaning that is relevant to the context.
For how would the rejection of Oedipus
imply that the Gods were blind
fates? Was it not rather based on a
misinterpretation of their will? The
conjectures μαυρούς (Nauck), μείους
(Martin) are not more satisfactory.
The best hitherto is Schndw.'s μοίρᾳ
ἐμποιεῖσθε.
With regard to the reading of the
text, which has strong MS. authority,
it may be noticed; (1) that there is no
difference of meaning between μοίραις
and μοίρᾳ, if this is supposed equivalent
το ἐν μοίρᾳ. This poetical al dative plural
occurs in Plat. Legg. 923 Β, τὸ ἑνὸς
ἑκάστου κατατιθεὶς ἐν μοίραις ἐλάττοσι
δικαίως. (2) Next, that the omission
of ev, or the substitution of the instrumental
dative (Essay on L. § 14 p. 20)
is supported by the similar use of τιμαῖς
(r mg. C²*.
275
280
278. μοί-
= ἐν τιμῇ ἀγόμενος, in Ο. Τ. 909, κούδαμοῦ τιμαῖς Ἀπόλλων ἐμφανής. See note
in loco. (3) This explanation of μοίραις
requires μηδαμῶς to be taken separately
from μή, and to have the force of an
independent negative. This is very unusual,
but may be defended, a. by the
consideration that μή negatives the sentence
as a whole, and a subordinate
negative is therefore more easily admissible;
b. that μηδαμῶς may be taken
closely with μοίραις after ποιεῖσθε = ὥστε
μηδαμῶς ἐν μοίραις εἶναι. c. In Plat. Legg.
11, 913 A, there is a parallel instance
in a participial clause, μηδ' αὖ κινήσειε
μηδὲ τὸ βραχύτατον ἐμὲ μηδαμῇ μηδαμῶς
πείθων. <gloss>Nor again let him move anything,
however small, without any sort
of consent from me.</gloss> And in El. 336,
καὶ μὴ δοκεῖν μὲν δρᾶν τι, πημαίνειν δὲ
μή, although the force of μή is continued
in the latter part of the line, the
second μή has an independent force.
Cp. also Eur Erechth. fr. 362. 1. 46,

The antithesis between the literal observance
of the local sanctities and the
higher obligations of justice and mercy
is the point of this part of the play.

use of μοῖρα for τιμή is in keeping with
the language of the play. See Introduction,

But his confession is a defence. The

whether the Ionic metre, which occurs

<p><lem>τᾶς σᾶς *ἃ πέπονθ᾽ ἀναιδή</lem>
This
conjectural reading. as well as the other
which has been proposed, τᾶς σᾶς, πέπον, ἔργ᾿ ἀναιδῆ, has been suggested
partly by the metrical difficulty, and
party by the fact that the Scholiast
appears to have taken ἀναιδή (ἔργα) to
be governed by ἀνοίξῃς. Schol. μὴ πρὸς
τῆς σῆς ξενίας ἀναπτύξῃς μου τὰ ἀναιδῆ
ἔργα. Against πέπον it may be argued
(1) that the word occurs nowhere in
tragedy, (2) that where it occurs in
Homer it is accompanied either by a
noun in the vocative, or by the interjection
4, (3) that it is improbable that
the first person (represented in the Scholion
by μου) should be omitted. The
word πέπονθα is in accordance with the
spirit of other passages of the play
(268, 537), and should be retained. ἃ
πέπονθα is substituted for ἔργα, to which
ἀναιδῆ is added as an emphatic epithet,
'My unwitting deeds of shame.' Hence
ἔργα was naturally inserted as a gloss.
Besides the metrical objection to the
MS. reading. ἀνοίξῃς requires an object,
and the asyndeton takes from the
smoothness of the passage without increasing
its force.

which takes the words in a

Aesch. Cho. 363-6, μηδ' ὑπὸ κ.τ.λ. ..

the historical tenses with εἰ, ἄν, ἵνα, ὡς,
ὅπως, to express an impossible supposition,
inference, motive, or result, is all
that can be urged in favour of this,
except the comparison of a passage
which has generally been thought corrupt,
infr. 1713, ἰώ, μὴ γᾶς ἐπὶ ξένας
θανεῖν ἔχρηζες. It may be further suggested,
that in both these instances the
unusual construction is assisted by an
echo (or harmonic) of ὤφελον in ἐπωφέλησα, and of ἐχρῆν in ἔχρηζες. If
this hypothesis is rejected, we must fall
back on Hermann's interpretation of
the words: 'Accepi, inquit Oedipus, donum,
uxorem dicens, quod ego ut nunquam
a civitate debuerim accipere, ei profui,
i. e. quod ut mihi non unquam daret

547. The MS. reading ἄλλους is condemned
both by sense and metre, but
the correction is uncertain. ἁλούς,
adopted in the text. may be explained
in two ways, (1) ἁλοὺς ἐφόνευσα = ἑάλων

ἁλούς proleptic. Essay on L. § 38. p. 70.
Cp. Ο. Τ. 1213. ἐφεῦρέ σ᾽ ἄκονθ᾽ ὁ πάνθ᾽

destiny) I did commit the murder.'
The former meaning gives rather a
better force to καί, and is on the whole
preferable, although the construction of
the participle is more natural in the
latter interpretation. Porson conjectured
ἄνους, (3) being infatuated.' but this
implies a degree of self-accusation, from
which Oedipus in the Oed. Col. is
wholly free.</p>

Theseus himself the final assurance of
rest and protection. The scruples of the

Creon is on his way from Thebes, but

which is followed, in 10, by an Iambic
dimeter catalectic</p><p>

which smooths the way for the recurrence
to the prevailing rhythm. Cp. supr.

The chief movement in the 2nd strophe
is choriambic (II. 1, 2, 6, 8, <figure/>)

varied with iambic and trochaic, which

daughters' sake, according to the unanimous

unwillingly from Athens: and utters a
curse on Creon and on his sons.

and, on the chorus further expostulating,
threatens to lay hands on Oedipus, who
thus provoked, utters a special curse
on Creon. A scuffle ensues between
the two old men: Creon taking hold
of Oedipus to drag him away. The
chorus (877 ff.) again cry aloud for
help, and Theseus, who has been sacrificing
at a neighbouring altar, enters in
haste. On learning what is the matter,
he orders the people from the sacrifices
to pursue the fugitives, and threatens
Creon with arrest if the maidens are
not produced immediately. He is sure
that Thebes will not resent this. She
cannot countenance such violence.
Creon then speaks for himself. He
could not have supposed that Athens
would have cared to protect his kindred,
or would have received an incestuous
person and a parricide under the shadow
of the hill of Ares. Hefurther excuses his
assault by the curses of Oedipus. He is
in Theseus' hands, but will resist harsh
treatment. The mention of hisunwitting
crimes calls forth a fresh outburst of
passion from Oedipus. Theseus breaks
off further conference by peremptorily
commanding Creon to show him where
the maidens are. Oedipus is left alone

Creon angrily repels the claim of Oedipus
to speak for the Attic elders (ἐρῶ
πρὸ τῶνδε), whom he calls to witness
Oedipus' treatment of him. The latter
words refer (1) to the lines in which Oedipus
curses his sons (ἔστιν δὲ παισὶν
μόνον), which Creon treats as the answer
to the message which he had
brought from the Καδμείων λέως: cp.
infr. 850, φίλους ὑφ᾽ ὧν ἐγὼ | ταχθεὶς τάδ'
ἔρδω. The structure closely resembles
Hom. Il. 1. 338, τὰ δ᾽ αὐτὼ μάρτυροι

manner suppressed. In the present

distinguishing Creon's personal injury
from the supposed offence against
Eteocles and the Thebans: unless (2)
φίλους refers to Creon himself, as professing

These lines may be differently
explained according as πόλει is taken
to refer to Thebes or to Athens. Either
reference is possibl possible, but πόλει in Creon's
previous speech, supr. 837, is clearly
Thebes. ῥύσιον is that which is held
by one party, and claimed or seized by
another, who is said ῥυσίων ἐφάπτεσθαι
(Aesch. Suppl. 412, καὶ μήτε δῆρις ῥυσίων ἐφάψεται, ib. 314, Ἔπαφος ἀληθῶς
ῥυσίων ἐπώνυμος). (1) Then assuredly
you will quickly pay moreover a heavier
forfeit to my state, for I will seize
not the maidens only. For this meaning
of τίθημι see L. and S. s. v. A. II, 8.
Or (2), 'Then assuredly you will cause
your city to have a still greater prey to

The
testimony of the grammarians (Phryn.

ἵππον : οἷον ἀπὸ χαλίνου ἢ ἄνευ χαλίνου :
Pollux 1. 214, καὶ ἀπὸ ῥυτῆρος ἀνεῖναι
τὸν ἵππον), and the passages in Diodorus
Sic. (19. 26), and Dion. Hal. (11. 40),
leave no doubt that ῥυτήρ in this expression
is not a trace but a rein, and that
the use of ἀπό is emphatic. τρέχειν ἀπὸ
ῥυτῆρος, of a horse, would then mean,
'to gallop away from' (i. e. without
check from, without the effect of) the
rein,' and in σπεύδειν ἀπὸ ῥυτῆρος the
notion is transferred from the horse to
the rider = 'to ride at full gallop.' The
phrase is immediately connected with
ἱππότην, but the notion of 'full speed'
is extended to the whole sentence. It
is singular that the ancient Scholiasts
should have lost the key to this expression
as they seem to have done. If
ῥυτήρ were a trace' as elsewhere (Il. 16.475 etc.), the meaning would be
⚫ without putting to,' i. e. riding, not
driving.

Eur. Heracl. 1010, τοῖσιν Ἑλλήνων νόμοις. Either the correction οὔσπερ must

But although Theseus speaks hyperbolically
of the success of Creon in capturing
the maidens as a conquest over
himself, he cannot speak of the Thebans
as glorying over the defeat of Poseidon,
Athena, the Eumenides, Dionysus (!),
etc. who are not gods of Colonus and

<p>While Oedipus remains
alone upon the rock, an object of profound
pity, the chorus burst into an exulting
strain, anticipating the victory of
Theseus and the restoration of Antigone
and Ismene.
The fray will soon begin. Would
I were there to see! Where will the
foemen turn to bay? At the pass of
Mount Aegaleon, or by the Eleusinian
shore? There will Theseus rouse the
combat, and the maidens shall be present
at the achievement of their deliverance.
Or descend they now from Phyle,
westward of the rock, the chariots
with the pursuing cavalry? The enemy
shall be overpowered. Mighty are the
men of Theseus: valiant are the horsemen
of our deme. They all are wor-
α.
shippers of Athene Hippia and of Poseidon.
Are they engaged? or is the
action still to be? My prophetic spirit
pleads for the restitution of the muchenduring,
much-wronged, maiden. O

victory which I foretell!
'Zeus, grant our people the attainment
of the fair prize and Pallas, his
dread child, and ye, Apollo and Artemis,
who love the chase, come jointly to our
country's aid.'
The metre of this chorus, at first glyconic,
passes more and more into slow
trochaic and iambic movements, with
frequent long syllables. The whole is
marked by great solemnity, with an
occasional note of triumph.

general expression for the seaward cliffs,
including those not actually touching

suit the mention of Eleusis. The question
is whether the engagement will be
in the pass of Daphne, or at some
further point on the Eleusinian way.
Cp the skirmish at ῾Ρειτοί in Thuc. 2.19. The Pythian cliffs' are so named
from the Pythium, a shrine of Apollo
in the deme of Oenoe, probably at the
place now called Daphne. According
to some authorities the Pythium was on
the Megarian frontier. But the place
so designated could not be on the way

The word recalls the two bands
of Thebans who had carried off Ismene
and Antigone and would now resist
their rescue. But the second part of
the compound is subordinate. Elmsley
says, “διστόλους ἀδελφάς dixit pro δισσῶν
ἀδελφῶν στόλον.' The maidens and their
captors are spoken of in a single phrase,

The latter part of the sentence is adapted
to the nearer subject (E. on L. § 36. p. 65,
2). The first intention was to speak
of Theseus and the captors of the maidens
as joining battle; then the thought
occurs, <gloss>the maidens also will be in the

with μάχην, or an equivalent word in
the accusative, is changed to ἐμμίξειν

more ado.</gloss> See Essay on L. § 43.

rhythm lucul is not
impossible (for the resolved trochee, cp.
Phoen. 227, 237); but the change of
rhythm from 1. 10 of the strophe (1054)

προμνᾶσθαι is generally to plead for

expressions as οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐθεώρουν (i.e.

to establish a transitive use of
θεωρεῖν. In Plat. Legg. 12. 951 C, ἂν

peculiar attraction, or metaphor, by
which θεωρήσασα agrees in gender with

an accusative of limitation, restricting

never. Cp. esp. Phil. 661, εἴ μοι θέμις,

καίτοι makes too strong an opposition,
after such an expression of doubt. But
the hesitation expressed in εἰ θέμις is
only the courtesy of a stranger addressing
a sovereign, whereas the following
clause expresses the revulsion of feeling
caused by the recollection of his misfortunes.

Hermann's correction, τίς for τις, is
borne out by ξύνοικος, which would be
too emphatic if the meaning were 'a

well as by the order of words in which
the inversion τις οὐκ would have no

and in this he has been generally followed.
But the words as they stand in
the MSS. are not altogether impossible.
The previous context, and the natural
pause after ἀνδρός, may justify the reference
of to the subject of θελήσαιμι.

In this case ἀνδρός, although implying
Theseus, is quite general: cp. О. Т.

The conjecture
of the Ist London edition, ἀλλ᾽ ἔασον,
has been accepted with various modifications
s by by subsequent sub critics. The text
is eloquently defended by Mr. Palmer,


who observes: 'I think it not quite
impossible to understand the brief expression,
backed up as it is by the
argument which follows, as the language
of earnest entreaty, and that the verb
is to be supplied by the mind. Antigone
had fully presented her request at the
commencement of her speech, so that
what she then said may be considered
as referred to in this short broken sentence,
ἀλλ᾿ αὐτόν. 'Nay, but receive
him graciously ... there are others who
have had bad sons and fierce anger,
and as they have been charmed into
gentleness by the soothing persuasion
of their friends, so be you.' If ἀλλ'
αὐτόν were uttered in a tone of earnest
entreaty, and the speaker abruptly added
what follows, I can conceive that it
would be very intelligible, and if so,
the touching effect of the entreaty would
be heightened by the very fact that the
sentence was unfinished. Antigone
leaves her father to imagine all she
meant to say, and supplies what is
wanting in words by the earnestness of
her manner and beseeching tone of
voice.' There is force in these remarks,
though the quotation of parallel examples
would be more to the purpose.
The MSS. are practically unanimous;
but the aposiopesis is all but unique.
Cp. however Aesch. Cho. 749 ff., where
Schütz and other editors suppose a
lacuna. And in this play there are
several places where the original construction
of a sentence is not carried
out. Cp. esp. supr. 421 ff., 531 ff.,
infr. 1299 ff., 1370 ff., 1669. Comparisons
between classical Greek and
the New Testament are usually too
<pb n="390"/>
remote to be of any use; but the language
of affection has similarities in
every age, and the ellipse in Philemon
12 is curiously parallel-σὺ δὲ αὐτόν
(sc. προσλαβοῦ, which is added from
the deferred apodosis in the Textus
Receptus). The motive in both cases
is the same, viz. a delicate tact, which
shrinks from uttering the word of command
or entreaty, and hastens to urge
fresh topics of persuasion. The deferred
apodosis is implied in line 1201, ἀλλ'
ἡμῖν εἶκε. Cp. Aesch. Cho. 649 ff.,
where Dindorf supposes a lacuna, σε
in Paris A (followed by R) is a gloss
of some grammarian who understood
the passage as it is explained in Canter's
note: 'Insigne est hoc ἀναπόδοτον, ac
singulare. Vult enim hoc dicere, ἀλλ'

The interpretation of 1. 1231 is doubtful.
It is clear, however, that if the
words φόνοι, στάσεις, etc., are in any
construction, the Scholiast is right in
explaining τίς οὐ καμάτων ἔνι to mean
οὐδείς ἐστι κάματος, ὃς οὐκ ἔνεστιν. For
the genitive, cp. Τr. 146, πνευμάτων οὐδὲν κλονεῖ. On the other hand the subject
of τίς πλάγχθη πολύμοχθος ἔξω is
<pb n="395"/>

generally supposed to be τίς ἀνήρ. (1)
'What trouble-vexed mortal wanders
out of the way' (i. e, the broad way of
trouble)?' i. e. Which of all the suffering
race is exempt from suffering? The
proleptic use of πολύμοχθος, although
curious, is not by any means fatal to
this interpretation (Essay on L. § 38. p.
70). But the inversion of the subject
('What man escapes? What trouble is
not there?' when combined with the
ellipse of ἀνήρ, is somewhat harsh. And
πλάγχθη ἔξω is a strange expression for
ἐξέφυγε. For πλάζεσθαι is generally,
'To miss a desired end;' or to be
driven out of an intended course. <gloss>Who
misses of being miserable?</gloss> (τίς ἔξω τοῦ
πολύμοχθος εἶναι ἐπλανήθη; 2nd Scholiast)
is a paradoxical expression in which
the paradoxical form has no force or
meaning. And if the paradox had been
intended it would have been more pointedly
brought out. The interpretation
of the 1st Scholiast is on the whole
more probable: τοῦτο ἰδίως ἐξήνεγκεν,
βούλεται δὲ τὸ τοιοῦτο σημαίνειν· τίς
ἂν πλαγχθείη τῶν πολλῶν μόχθων; (2)
Which of the many troubles will be
turned aside?' i. e. anticipating the
notion of καμάτων, τίς πολύμοχθος κάματος πλάγχθη ἔξω, τίς καμάτων οὐκ ἔνι;
<gloss>What troublous woe misses the life?
What woe is not found therein?</gloss> The
retention of the same subject, and the
antithesis of ἔξω and ἔνι, are in favour
of this. The personification (cp. supra
536, μυρίων ἐπιστροφαὶ κακῶν) is in
harmony with the catalogue which fol-
ἐπιλέλογχε] ἐπιλέlows,
and with ἐπιλέλογχε in 1. 1236.

ἔξω is not more difficult than the similar
ellipse after ἔνι. The collocation of
πολύμοχθος κάματος is like πολύπλανοι
πλάναι in Aesch. Prom. 585, and even

if that is necessary, would be Homeric,

an expansion partly of πάντοθεν, partly

being confused. Cp. Hdt. 3. 114, Ἀποκλινομένης δὲ μεσαμβρίης, κ.τ.λ. where
locality is signified in words expressing
the time of day. Some from the region
of the sunset, some with the break of
day, some through the meridian brightness,
some coming with the blasts of
night.' The last expression has been
variously interpreted. The Scholiast
speaks of the Rhipaean mountains, which,
he adds, were towards the west, and
quotes a line of Alcman, ῥιπὰς ὄρος
ἀνθέον ὕλᾳ, νυκτὸς μελαίνας στέρνον. The
north rather than the west is the region
of midnight. But it is not likely that
after speaking so simply of morning,
noon, and evening, the poet would have
perplexed his reference to night with an
obscure allusion to a remote locality.
(2) Some modern interpreters compare
Ε1. 106, παμφεγγεῖς ἄστρων ῥιπάς, and
would render, 'From the twinkling fires
of night,' or, From the glimmerings
of night.' Cp. τὰ νυκτερινὰ φέγγη in
Plat. Rep. 6. 508 C. But this gives no
distinct image, and the antithesis to
ἀκτῖν' does not improve the sense. (3)

thee, not indeed as they will be by-andby,
if once those battalions move towards
the town of Thebes.</gloss> The curse of
Oedipus is absolute: but its immediate
execution depends on the action of Polynices.
Antigone may be supposed to
have these words in her mind when she
entreats her brother to turn his army
back. Infr. 1416 ff. The apodosis to
which μέν looks forward (εἰσόψεται δέ) is
absorbed in the relative clause, ὡς αὐτίκα,
SC. εἰσόψεται.
(2) Retaining που from L, and supposing
ὡs to be pleonastic as in various adverbial
expressions (cp. esp. El. 1452, ὡς ἐτητύμως: Phil. 58, πλεῖς δ᾽ ὡς πρὸς οἶκον),
a different turn may perhaps be given
to the expression. Therefore the eye
of Heaven regards thee, I do not say
for immediate vengeance, since these
battalions are on their march to Thebes.'
In this case Oedipus contrasts the proud
advance of Polynices at the head of the
Argive host (cp. Ant. 119 ff.) with his
impending ruin. For this momentary
suspension of the curse, cp. Phil. 961,
ὅλοιο μή πω, κ.τ.λ. The deferred apodosis
is resumed by implication in
1372 ff. εἴπερ, with the indicative, suits
better with (2): 'if. as you tell me.'
This is a real example of tragic irony.

πω, because assisting the ironical expression.

In the edition of Turnebus, ἐρεῖ

Hermann justly remarks, Etiam si
illa fortasse codicis alicuju alicujus scriptura
est, non levis manet suspicio, ingenioso
eam correctori potius quam ipsi poetae
deberi, non quod ἐρείψεις gravius verbum
sit quam expectes, aut quod κείνην

rebus enim non est argutandum: sed
quod codicum et veterum editionum
scriptura tantum abest ut sensu careat,
ut propterea tantum, quia difficilior est,
correctione opus habuisse videatur.'
The interpretation of the passage turns
on the associations surrounding the
word πόλις. (Cp. supra 837, 858.)
Oedipus, in speaking to Polynices of
Thebes, avoids the word πόλις, and uses
ἄστυ instead, because, as he says with
a sort of angry logic, 'Thebes shall never
more be a city to Polynices, who shall
be ἄπολις Θήβης as he is ἀπάτωρ ἐμοῦ'
(1383). It is to be remembered that
the words πόλις and πατρίς were used
by Greeks with the same affection.
ate familiarity, and the same consciousness
of the privileges attaching
to them, as the words πατήρ, μήτηρ,
ἀδελφός, and the like. This is not
equally the case with ἄστυ, which is


rather the place, while πόλις is the
commonwealth, <gloss>furnished well with
men.</gloss> Cp. Eur. Phoen. 613, Π. ὦ
πόλις. ΕΤ. μολὼν ἐς Ἄργος ἀνακάλει
Λέρνης ὕδωρ. On the use of the indefinite
for the second personal pronoun, see
Essay on L. § 22. p. 36. It may be
further observed, against the reading of
Turnebus, that Oedipus, who is looking
forward to the defeat of the Thebans at
his grave, is not likely thus to emphasize
the impregnable strength of their
city.

the protection of Poseidon, from whose

πάλιν | ἅπαντα τἀνθρώπεια: Τr. 132 ff.:
Hdt. 1. 5, τὰ γὰρ τὸ πάλαι μεγάλα ἦν,
τὰ πολλὰ αὐτῶν σμικρὰ γέγονε· τὰ δὲ ἐπ᾿
ἐμεῦ ἦν μεγάλα, πρότερον ἦν σμικρά. τὴν
ἀνθρωπηΐην ὧν ἐπιστάμενος εὐδαιμονίαν
οὐδαμὰ ἐν τωὐτῷ μένουσαν, ἐπιμνήσομαι
ἀμφοτέρων ὁμοίως. And for αὔξων ἄνω,
infr. 1567, πάλιν σε δαίμων δίκαιος αὔξοι.
In this interpretation ἐπεὶ μέν is supposed
to be used after the analogy of
ὅτε μέν. And this is hardly admissible,
if the usage, ὅτε μὲν
ὅτε δὲ.. is to
be explained, as seems most probable,
by the original identity of the relative
with the demonstrative. Cp. ὃς μὲν .. ὃς
δὲ ..
(2) To meet the difficulty Canter
conjectured ἐκεῖ, i. e. <gloss>In yonder case.</gloss>
Others have supposed that ἐπεί is the
corruption of a verb or participle. The
words τρέπων τὰ ἤδη αὐξηθέντα, in the
confused note of the Scholiast, have
suggested στρέφων (Schndw., who reads
δέδοικα δ' in the antistrophe), i.e. 'turning
backward:' (τρέπει is nearer to the MSS,
but the indicative could not be followed
by a participle with dé coming between).
But although Eur. fr. 540 says φεῦ τὰ
τῶν εὐδαιμονούντων ὡς τάχα στρέφει
θεός, the word is less natural here.
Another conj., which gives the same
general meaning without altering the
rhythm, is áveis, 'letting go'-the
opposite of ἀνέχων οἱ ἐπέχων :-'dropping
some things, and lifting others on
high.' Cp. Aj. 1214, νῦν δ᾽ οὗτος ἀνεῖται :
Pind. Pyth. 2. 89, (χρὴ δὲ πρὸς θεὸν οὐκ
ἐρίζειν) ὃς ἀνέχει ποτὲ μὲν τὰ κείνων,
τότ᾽ αὖθ᾽ ἑτέροις ἔδωκεν μέγα κύδος.
1455-
έτερα CA.</p>
<p><lem>(τάδ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἤματ᾿</lem> B Vat.)
(3) The above conjectures suppose
an alteration of the antistrophe. The
conj. ἐριπὼν μὲν ἕτερα, suggested in our
former edition, requires no further
change, and, in common with that of
Schndw., gives the rhythm (ト​(レト
υιυΐυιτών. Dind. conj.</p>
<p><lem>ἄγων.</lem> Qy. ἀπάγων ?
(4) It has been suggested to give
ἕτερα the meaning of 'bad,' ' sinister,'
as in Pind. Pyth. 3. 34, 5, δαίμων δ᾽
ἕτερος | ἐς κακὸν τρέψας ἐδαμάσσατό νιν.
But this does not help us to a clear
context.
(5) The MS. reading τὰ δὲ πήματ᾿
can be rendered metrical by the simple
insertion of γε: τὰ δέ γε πήματ'. But
πήματα αὔξειν ἄνω is not a natural expression,
whether a succession of miseries
is spoken of, as in Aesch. Cho. 1020,
μόχθων δ᾽ ὁ μὲν αὐτίχ᾽, ὁ δ᾽ ἥξει, οι αὔξειν
πήματα is imagined to mean 'to cure
misfortune.' Although the text is uncertain,
the general meaning probably
is, Time casts down some things, and
others that yesterday were mean, to-day
he glorifies. Cp. Aj. 131, 2, ὡς ἡμέρα
κλίνει τε κἀνάγει πάλιν | ἅπαντα τἀνθρώπεια.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1457"><p>Some critics, including Elmsley,
have imagined that the thunder is heard
immediately on the departure of Oedipus.
But a more natural connection is
preserved if the chorus are supposed first
to express the gloomy forebodings with
which the curse of Oedipus has filled
their minds, and then to be panic-stricken
on hearing the thunder. If it had already
thundered, this would in some way have
been clearly announced. See Schol. on
1. 1450, εἰ μὴ κατὰ μοῖραν ταῦτα πάσχω,

The older explanation (as old as Eustathius)
that τυγχάνων ὑπεσχόμην =
ἔτυχον ὑποσχόμενος, besides making an
imperfect tense equivalent to an aorist,
makes τυγχάνων an unmeaning addition
to the line. The correspondence in

supposed to pray that the end of Oedipus

(2) 'without result,' i. e. bringing no
good after them. The latter is more
probable; i.e. Though no such result

as the son of Earth, who receives
the bodies of the Dead, and
Tartarus, which (cp. supra 1389), like
'Olympus,' has less of a special and
local meaning in Sophocles than in

natural than that Antigone in the first

to modern life and poetry. Shak. King
John, 3.4, 'Const. But now shall cankersorrow

will look as hollow as a ghost, As

The most probable
explanation of these words is
Hermann's, who, for the sake of metre,
reads τῷ for ἰώ. (Quare) utinam ne in
peregrina terra cupivisses mori, sed mortuus
esses ita mihi desertus. Quoniam
enim sentit tanto minus leniri dolorem
<pb n="437"/>
suum posse, quod ne tumulus quidem
patris sibi relictus sit, optat ut ille ne
quaesivisset hanc apud exteros mortem,
sed obiisset potius ita desertus ignotusque,
ut ante cum ipsa per terras
vagus errabat, quo saltem sepelire eum
et justa facere in tumulo posset.' This
interpretation supposes the use of μή
with an historical tense of the indicative
to express a strong negative
wish, as has been already suggested
in the note on supra 540, 1. Ср.
Aesch. Cho. 363 ff. This uncommon
use would be here softened by exppses,
suggesting ἐχρῆν σε, ας ἐπωφέλησα in
541 was suggestive of ὤφελες. On the
other hand, the words in 1714, especially
when compared with 1717, Plat.
Phaedo, 58 C, ἀλλ' ἐρῆμος ἐτελεύτα
φίλων, may very naturally mean, 'As it
is, thou diedst unattended by me,' while
the positive expression of a wish by the
past tense is more doubtful than the
negative. And Mr. Palmer, reading lú
μοι, γῆς ἐπὶ ξένας, κ.τ.λ., gives this
turn to the sentence: 'Ah me! thou
didst desire to die in a foreign land;
yet thou hast thus died deserted by me.'
So also Schneidewin, omitting μή. But
such a resumption of the beginning of
the speech is too inartistic and abrupt
for Sophocles. It is therefore better
to follow Hermann and render, Would
that thou hadst not cared to die in a
strange land, but hadst died as thou
wert, all alone upon my hands.'</p></div>

has taken the place of ἔχον (sc. μετέχον),
or some other word. The corruption
occurring at such an early period
is more probably due to the confusion
to which all negative expressions are
liable (E. on L. § 29. 2, p. 49), but which
in the present instance cannot be attributed
to the poet; i. e. οὐδὲν ἀτηρόν
<pb n="460"/>
 ἐσθ᾽ ὁποῖον οὐκ ὄπωπα, has become
confused in the mind of some early
interpreter with οὐδέν ἐσθ᾽ ὁποῖον οὐκ
ἀτηρόν = οὐδέν ἐστ᾽ ἄτης ἄτερ. Qy. ἄτης
πλέων? The emphasis culminates on
ἄτιμον, which pointedly refers to the
dishonour she is now to speak of.

<p><lem>σὺν δίκῃ | †χρησθεὶς δικαίᾳ καὶ νόμῳ</lem>

χρησθείς has been generally condemned,
and ἐχρήσθην only occurs elsewhere
in a strictly passive sense.
Yet, as Shilleto observes (Journ. of Phil.
No. 13, p. 149), ᾐδεσάμην and ᾐδέσθην, the former in lyric verse, the latter
in senarii, are found within a few lines
of each other in O. T. 647, 651; and
χρησάμενος does not occur in Sophocles.</p>
<p><lem>Ἐτεοκλέα ἔκρυψε, χρησθεὶς (αὐτῷ) σὺν
δίκῃ,</lem> is not impossible in point of syntax.
On the other hand neither χρησθεὶς
δίκαια, nor χρηστοῖς δικαίᾳ, nor προσθεὶς
δίκαια, can be approved. In 1871 I
suggested προθείς. ‘After laying him
out in state, with the righteous meed of
honour and all customary observance,
he has covered him in earth.' Cp. Hdt. 1.112, 5. 8, τρεῖς μὲν ἡμέρας προτιθέασι
τὸν νεκρόν: inf. 196, καὶ τὰ πάντ᾽ ἐφαγνίσαι. This part of the treatment
of Eteocles would contrast with the
prohibition even to mourn for Polynices.
Cp. Thuc. 2. 34, where the words καὶ
ἐπιφέρει τῷ αὑτοῦ ἕκαστος ἤν τι βούληται
throw some light on the custom implied
in σὺν δίκῃ δικαίᾳ καὶ νόμῳ. For the
emphatic δικαίᾳ, cp. Αj. 1100, ἐς ταφὰς
ἐγὼ θήσω δικαίως: Hdt. 8. 106, νόμῳ
δικαίῳ χρεώμενοι. προθείς may have
been changed to προσθείς (which Donaldson
conjectured), and to this may have
been added an interlinear gloss ἃ χρή.
Cp. 1. 243. κάφαγιστεύσας ἃ χρή. Another
guess is χρῆσθαι δικαιῶν (sc. αὐτῷ).

Cp. Eur. Or. 424, ἀληθὴς δ᾽ ἐς φίλους
ἔφυν φίλος. Antigone goes to perform
the sepulture, and Ismene returns into
the palace. The stage is left vacant.
As in the Ajax, there is a distinct
break after the prologue, which has
laid the ground of the action so far as
Antigone is concerned. The first episodion,
ll. 163 ff., is in one sense a fresh
beginning, as setting forth the motives
of Creon, and still only preparing for
the collision. The parados, ll. 100 ff.,
introduces us to the public feeling of
Thebes, and to the wider sphere of
which the action forms the central point.
100 ff. Instead of a long series of anapaests,
followed by lyrical strophes and
antistrophes, as in the Ajax (with which
cp. Aesch. Agamemnon), we have here
two strophes and antistrophes alternating
with anapaestic systems of about
seven lines each: making a form of
parodos intermediate between that of
the Ajax and that of the O. T., in
which there are no anapaests. The
α' (100-9=117-33).
chorus on its first appearance chants
ll. 100-9, then advances while the coryphaeus
recites 110-16, then the antistrophe
is chanted, then another advance
is made during the recitative of 11. 127-133, then strophe B' is chanted, the
chorus by this time standing near the
stage; then they make a final advance,
and, during the second antistrophe, are
standing full in front of the stage.
Lastly, as Creon is seen approaching,
the coryphaeus chants ll. 155-62, which
thus form at once the conclusion of the
parodos and the 'introit' or prelude of
the first episodium.</p><p>
The total effect is that of a stately
and solemn triumph, in which the bright
influence of the glyconic opening is tempered
with slow movements (---),
as in 11. 106, 122, 137, 151, and interrupted
rhythms, as in 11. 103, 120, 138,
152; the notes of triumph and solemnity
being combined in the choriambi,
which bring the lyrical part to a close.

The culmination of feeling is marked
by the dactylic opening of β'. The
rhythms of a' 3. 4, 6, and β' 3, 4, show
the correlation of the two movements.
The adaptation of sound to sense is
specially obvious in the resolved trochees
of a' 7, while the concluding lines, a' 8,
β' 7, serve to harmonize the logaoedic
with the anapaestic measures. Cp. O. C.
135-7, 167-9.</p><p>
'Never did morning rise so fair as
this which thou didst bring at length
to waiting Thebè, O eye of golden
day! For thy first beams, shooting
over Dircè's rills, stirred into quicker
flight the Argive warrior, who for Polynices'
quarrel swooped upon our land
on snow-white wing, with many a shield
and many a plumèd helm.</p><p>
Threatening our halls in towering
pride he stood, and gaped with bristling
spears around our gates, thirsting for
our blood: but he is gone, or ever his
desire was slaked, or ever the fire-god

caught our coronal of towers. Such
fight displayed the serpent writhing in
his gripe, not easily subdued. Such din
of war assailed him as he turned to flee.
For Zeus abhors the boaster and contemns
the clank of gold. And when
he saw them moving in a full proud
stream, he smote with lightning from
on high the daring climber who had
gained the pinnacle and was eagerly
preparing to shout victory. And swung
to earth he fell with a rebound, the firebearer,
who with mad rush was breathing
his blast of enmity against the wall.
And various was the fortune of the
day. But terrible was the War-god as
he plunged amidst our enemies, a mighty
helper for us.</p><p>
'For at all our gates their captains,
seven against seven, left their panoplies
as trophies to our cause. All, save the
horrid pair, who fell together with the
guilt of mutual fratricide.</p><p>
<gloss>But forget we the griefs of war.
For victory came with smiles of joy to
greet our smiling town. So visit we
the temples of the gods with dances
all night long: and let Theban Bacchus
be the master of our revelry.</gloss>

The emendation

<p><lem>τοῖος .. δράκοντι</lem>
(1) 'Such din
of war was spread about his rear by the
reluctant snake, no easy matter to subdue.'
So the Scholiast, who wrote τὸ δὲ
ἀντιπάλῳ δράκοντι ἀντὶ τοῦ ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀντιπάλου δράκοντος, ὡς Ἀχιλῆϊ δαμασθείς
(Il. 22. 55). Or (2) δυσχείρωμα may
be taken to mean the act rather than
the object of victory (cp. O. Τ. 560,
θανασίμῳ χειρώματι), and the sense may
be, <gloss>Such din of war encompassed him,
issuing in a hard-won victory for the
serpent matching his foe.</gloss> In this case
it will make little difference to read the
genitive. Or, (3) if the genitive is read
(Wecklein), the words may be taken in
yet another way: 'Such din of war
harassed him from behind, the hard-to-be-subdued
might of the serpent, who
was a match for his foe.' The genitive
is given as an alternative reading by the
1st hand of L, and is supported by V
(Ven. 468). But the dative is alone
recognised by the Scholiast.
</p><p>
The δράκων is certainly the emblem
of Thebes, and the eagle and snake
are in conflict, as in Il. 12. 201, foll.,
where also the serpent struggles and
escapes : ὁ δ᾽ οὔπω λήθετο χάρμης, | κόψε

The Scholiast, who wrote καὶ
τὴν τοῦ χρυσοῦ φαντασίαν ὑπερβεβηκότας τῇ ἰδίᾳ ὑπεροψίᾳ, seems to have read
ὑπερόπτας, which appears in the margin
of some copies. The ὑπεροψία of his
interpretation may have given rise to
ὑπεροπτίας, as in conjunction with this
it has suggested ὑπεροπλίαις, (Vauvillers,
who compares II. 1. 205). Musgr. and
Böckh are contented with ὑπεροπτείας,

For the use of ἔχω with the locative

The reading in the text is suggested by
that of V (Ven. 468), a MS. of the 13th
century, which, together with many obvious
corruptions, has preserved some
good readings. See on O. T. 1526.
This MS. reading is curiously near the
conj. of Musgrave, εἶχε δ᾽ ἄλλᾳ τὰ δείν᾽.
The epithet, as read in the text, may
be suggested by a forefeeling of what is
coming. Even the end of Capaneus is less
awful than that of Eteocles and Polynices
(144 ff.). Hermann's reading, εἶχε
δ᾽ ἄλλᾳ μὲν ἄλ | λᾳ· τὰ δ᾽ ἐπ᾿ ἄλλοις,
makes good enough sense; Plat. Rep. 2.
369 Β, οὕτω δὴ ἄρα παραλαμβάνων ἄλλος
ἄλλον ἐπ᾿ ἄλλου, τὸν δ᾽ ἐπ᾿ ἄλλου χρείᾳ :
but the synaphea between the cretics

however already felt, esp. in ll. 173,

of one young in power is shown in the

characteristically dwells on the virtue of
loyalty (165-9, 209, 10) and the crime
of rebellion (199-202): and his passionate

The connection is not
strictly logical. γάρ explains not the
difficulty of discerning the difference between
rulers, but the essential point on
which the difference turns. In setting
forth this, Creon also declares the spirit
of his own policy. He is feeling his
way with the elders, of whose submission
he is not perfectly sure, and 'beats
about the bush' before coming to the
point with them. Hence he repeats the
same thought in different words.</p></div>

184 ff. Having shown what makes
the good and bad ruler, Creon declares
his own intentions, first generally, and
then (192 ff.) with reference to Eteocles
and Polynices. γάρ implies that his
opinion will be proved by his acts. In
both statements (178-83, 184-90) the
stress is laid on the duty of renouncing
friendship with the public enemy (182-183, 187-188), which is the ground of the

The half-comic or rustic
character of the watchman in this play
is an extension of the common character
of the 'messenger,' whose natural rudeness
of speech and thought brings into
greater prominence the horror or pathos
of the events he describes. The grotesqueness
disappears when he speaks
of the action of Antigone in 407-440.
The employment of this artifice by
Sophocles arises from the same motive
to which Shakespeare gave a far wider
range in such creations as the 'gravediggers'
in Hamlet, and the 'rural
fellow' in Antony and Cleopatra. The
Messenger in the Trachiniae, the Corinthian
in the Oedipus Tyrannus, Menelaus
in the Ajax, the pretended Shipmaster
in the Philoctetes, afford the
same sort of contrast to the more tragic
personages: and the superstition of the
Coloniatae may be compared with the
cowardice of the Phrygian slave in the
Orestes of Euripides.

as unsafe to follow his authority in this

evident that he is quoting from memory:
and, although it is curious that the
Scholiast uses the same word in his explanation,
οὐ τοῦτο λέγω, ὅτι μετὰ σπουδῆς ἀσθμαίνων πρὸς σὲ πορεύομαι, yet this
does not amount to a proof that this is

word which would be more naturally
used in prose, but it is less pointed than
τάχους in this connection. κοῦφον ἐξάρας πόδα is added in explanation of

and Donaldson read as in the text,
interpreting (2) Every man' (πᾶς implied

from the negative) 'defended himself
by pleading ignorance of the matter.'
For φεύγειν, * to urge a defensive plea,'
cp. Aesch. Suppl. 390, and for the plea,
μὴ εἰδέναι, Plat. Legg. 11. 936 E. But
the plea of ignorance, although suitable
in 1. 266, is too special for this place,
wherethe non-appearance of the criminal
alone is in question. The meaning given
above (1) is the same as that required by
Hermann (see below), but is more simply
expressed by the epexegesis, and the
imperfect tense expresses the frustration
of continued search. This interpretation
involves a rare use of φεύγω, which is,
however, analogous to a meaning of
ἐκφεύγω that is not uncommon. Cp.
Ο. Τ. 111, ἐκφεύγει δὲ τἀμελούμενον :
Plat. Phil. 17, τὰ δὲ μέσα αὐτοὺς ἐκφεύγει.
Other emendations are ἔφυγε τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι
(Porson), explained by Erfurdt to mean
'amoliens a se accusationem scire sese
negaverat ;' ἔφυγε τῷ μὴ εἰδέναι (Herm.
1839), 'effugit, eo quod nesciebamus;'
ἔφευγε πᾶς τὸ μή, ‘every man pled Not

have existed in different places as a
popular belief, but nowhere to have
received positive legal sanction. For a

Scholia, would be unexceptionable, if
such a potential use of the future in an

Blaydes' ὑπήγαγεν would be convincing

φησί, καὶ ὁ Ζεὺς ὥρισαν ὥστε θάπτεσθαι τοὺς νεκρούς.. θέλει δὲ εἰπεῖν ὅτι

that she did not consider his proclamations
as emanating from Zeus, the
supreme God, or from that justice
which regulated the rights of the dead,
who, she says, have established these
laws, namely, the laws of sepulture,
which do not need any enactment, but
have their ὅροι set up in the human
heart.' (Donaldson.) The iteration of
τούσδε, in contrasting the law which
she obeyed with the edict of Creon,
is dramatically appropriate, and there
is no difficulty in the vague use of the
demonstrative. See Essay on L. § 22.

The MSS. have ΙΣ. But
Böckh has given strong reasons for following
Aldus in assigning the line to Antigone.
The last speech of Creon might
well move her to break silence, which she
does naturally by resenting the words
not for herself, but for Haemon. There
is also greater bitterness in this line
<pb n="506"/>
than in any speech of Ismene. Then,
granting that τὸ σὸν λέχος, addressed
to Ismene, might mean 'The marriage
you prate of,' the words express a much
deeper feeling as addressed to Antigone.
Outwardly a mere expression of impatience,
they convey the only touch
of natural feeling which Creon betrays.
574 and 576 are then most naturally
given to the chorus. The act of Creon
in sacrificing his son's happiness is more
solemnly marked when his words are
addressed to the coryphaeus. While
adhering to this view I am bound to
add that some of the best critics
prefer the other arrangement of the
persons.

The grotesque image of Death, or
Hades, armed with a bloody chopper
or cleaver, however agreeable to the
manner of Euripides, or some other
poets, has no parallel in the language
of Sophocles. And the transition from
this concrete imagery to the spirits of
fury and madness is, to say the least,
awkwardly abrupt. The words λόγου
τ᾽ ἄνοια καὶ φρενῶν Ἐρινύς are most
natural if they are added to expand an
obscure allusion to the deed which had
brought Antigone into danger. And
the words φοινία θεῶν τῶν νερτέρων ..
κόνις, 'The deadly dust sacred to the
gods below,' convey such an allusion
not more obscurely than do the words
in Tr. 836 ff., δεινοτάτῳ μὲν ὕδρας
προστετακὼς φάσματι, κ.τ.λ., express the
condition of Heracles in the poisoned
robe. Triclinius was therefore not absurd
in saying εἰκότως δὲ τὸ κόνις τέθειται. διότι γὰρ ἐκάλυψεν Ἀντιγόνη

rather spoke of an influence passing
from the eye of the beloved (τὸ ἐρωτικὸν ὄμμα, Plat. Phaedr. 253 E) to the
soul of the lover. Desire was viewed

Plato's account of ἵμερος, Phaedr. 251

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="857"><p>Thou hast touched my saddest
thought, the thrice-told tale of my
father's sorrow.' Boeckh has cleared
up the difficulties of this passage (1) by
showing that οἶκτον harmonizes better
with the context than οἶτον or οἶκον, and
also gives a construction to πότμου:
(2) by tracing the derivation of τριπόλιστον from πολίζω = πολέω, which
occurs in the compound avναπολίζω :
(3) by rightly explaining the dative
Λαβδακίδαισιν. See E. on L. § 13. p. 19.
He also points out that μερίμνας is
genitive, because the singular is more
forcible, and μέριμναν would have suited
the metre equally well. The only remaining
doubt is the construction of οἶκτον.</p>
<p><lem>ψαύειν</lem> may govern the accusative, as
appears from 961. But the change
from the genitive to the accusative is
still to be accounted for. (1) The word
ἔψαυσας was chosen with special reference
to μερίμνας. ἔλεξας, or some
other general word, would have been
sufficient if this had not intervened.
Hence the general meaning of the verb
(= ἔλεξας) is alone continued. (2) The
case is partly governed by the verbal
notion in μερίμνας = 8 μεριμνῶ. (3) The
tendency of a Greek sentence is to pass
from a more special to a more general
construction. Essay on L. pp. 64, 5,
οἶκτον is to be resumed with πότμου, which
is co-ordinate with πατρός. Thou
hast harped on what my mind broods
over with saddest care, the thrice renewed
pity for my father, and for the

general fortune of our race, the lot that
fell upon the famed Labdacidae.' Seyffert
thinks that in τριπόλιστον Antigone
is thinking of her own ever-deepening
grief. But the Scholiast and Boeckh
are probably right in explaining the
word (like κλεινοῖς) with reference to
the widely felt compassion for Oedipus.
Cp. O. C. 517, τό τοι πολὺ καὶ μηδαμὰ
λῆγον: ib. 597, πᾶς τοῦτό γ' Ἑλλήνων
θροεῖ. For τριπόλιστον, cp. Phil. 1238,
δὶς ταὐτὰ βούλει καὶ τρὶς ἀναπολεῖν μ'

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="861"><p><lem>κλεινοῖς</lem> is said with bitterness,
as in O. T. 1207, κλεινὸν Οἰδίπου κάρα.

was calamity, O my hapless

ματρῷαι λέκτρων ἆται] ‘My mother's
calamity in marriage.' λέκτρων is descriptive
or distinctive genitive (Essay
on L. § 9. p. 12), and the possessive
ματρῷαι is joined to λέκτρων ἆται taken
as one word. In observing Antigone's
tenderness for her mother we are reminded
that the plot of the Oedipus
Tyrannus was not yet conceived.

The dative ἐμῷ πατρί (Ε. on L. § 13.

the adjective; i. e. αὐτογέννητ᾽ ἦν αὐτῷ
τὰ κοιμήματα. The nature of constructions
in such condensed expressions can
only be explained by expanding each
phrase into a sentence. The meaning
of the passive verbal termination in
αὐτογέννητα is extremely indefinite.
The other way of taking the words
('Connubium dicit Jocastae cum Oedipo
quem ipsa pepererat,' Dind.), although
giving a more obvious construction to
the dative, has the fatal blemish of
making a twofold apostrophe to Jocasta,

This must be
addressed to Polynices, who is most in
the thoughts of the spectators, and is
again invoked in the same words in
1.915: not to Eteocles, of whose burial
Antigone only knew by hearsay, supr.
23 ff. The difficulty of reconciling this
with the following lines has been adduced
as one of several reasons for rejecting
the passage from 1. 900 to 1. 928
in whole or in part. The lines 905-12
are apt to appear to modern readers, as
they did to Goethe, a blemish in a
place which might have been expected
to be most carefully finished. The
saying, which Herodotus, 3. 119, attributes
almost in the same terms to the
wife of Intaphernes, would seem from
this to have had a wide currency in
Ionia-for it is a precarious supposition
that either author derived it from the
other-and fell in with the natural tendency
of Greek life to exalt the bond of
brotherhood above all other ties of affection
and kindred. The general feeling
of the speech is well traced by
Seyffert. Antigone, when brought face
to face with death, in utter isolation
from human sympathy, comes down
from the lofty tone she had assumed in
her first answer to Creon, and recognizes
the simple fact that it was the
strength of her affection which impelled
her to defy the law. Her love for Poly-

nices was wonderful, passing the love
that could be felt for a husband or a
child. She dilates on this and justifies
it by a primitive sophism, which the
passage of Herodotus cited above shows
to be more in the spirit of the time of
Sophocles or of the age preceding him
than of any later period. If the Antigone
is the earliest of the seven plays
(see Introduction), we need not be surprised
by an archaism of thought which
is much less remarkable than several
which occur in Aeschylus. In an early
English ballad, called the Douglas
Tragedy, a woman interceding for the
life of her father, whom her lover would
slay, gives the following reason :-'True
lovers I can get many a one, | But a
father I'll never get more.'</p></div>

The chorus, in the manner
of Pindar, moralise on the fate of Antigone
through examples drawn from the
circle of mythology and legend; and
thus suggest the same cold comfort as
in their mention of Niobe. The effect
of this ode is to repress the excitement
and solemnize the thoughts of the
spectator.
'Danaë, though of royal lineage, and
entrusted with the golden shower, was
bound by all-constraining destiny in her
brazen cell.
'Bound, too, in a prison of rock, was
Lycurgus, who provoked the God. He
knew his madness when it was too late.
'And on the Thracian promontory
Phineus' sons, blinded by their father's
wife (Idothea), bewailed their rejected
mother Cleopatra's hapless lot, who,
descended from an ancient line, and endowed
with swiftness by her divine sire,
was notwithstanding overtaken by the
long-lived fates.'
Danae and Cleopatra were, like Antigone,
of royal birth, and, like Antigone,
were bound in a living tomb. So also
was the son of Dryas, himself a king:
and this, in his case, was the penalty of
an impetuous and defiant spirit.
Sophocles seems to have followed
one version of the obscure and variable
legend of Phineus, according to which
Cleopatra did not die, but was rejected
by Phineus for Idothea, and imprisoned
in a cave, from which she was afterwards
released by Heracles. The sons
were blinded by their step-mother.
The first strophe and antistrophe are
choriambic with an iambic close; the
second, logaoedic. The choriambi here
were probably chanted slowly, so as to
have a weighty, solemn effect. The

retaining μέν from the later MSS,

general notion of distraction which is
here expressed. The words in L etc.</p>
<p><lem>παῖ καὶ θῶ (=</lem> 'Which way also I shall
order them'), are clearly a corruption
of πᾷ κλιθῶ, which, however, was probably
a gloss. For if πάντα γάρ is
dropped instead, the asyndeton of λέχρια, κ.τ.λ., is very harsh.

‘For

to be borne has leapt upon my head.'
The opposition is not between Haemon
and Eurydice (Dindorf), nor between
present and future (Seyffert), but between
the visible circumstances and the
invisible hand of fate. λέχριος is used
metaphorically. (See Essay on L. p.
105.) Creon cannot bear the misery
that surrounds him, and he cannot look
up because of the heavy weight of
destiny impending over him.
