THE OEDIPUS TYRANNUS of Sophocles is the most typical of Greek
tragedies, and is accordingly the one most frequently cited by Aristotle
in support of his definitions. It may also be said to stand apart from
other tragedies and from all other compositions, as a tragedy by itself,
'eine tragoedie seiner eignen Gattung,' as Goethe said. But this
very singularity lies in the perfect development of the various elements
of Greek tragic art, which in the other plays, even of Sophocles, are
nowhere so completely exemplified.
1. THE FABLE (μύθος).
The twofold unnatural crime, unconsciously committed, coming
suddenly and strangely to the knowledge of men, and casting down

the unwitting criminal from the highest prosperity to the lowest
misery, was an essentially tragic subject, and could not fail, even
in the barest recital, to arouse feelings of wonder, pity, and fear.
Had the crime been voluntary, there would have been horror, but
no pathos;
<quote rend="blockquote">
    <l>This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,</l>
</quote>

Touches us not with pity.'</p><p>
But, as it is, the pity is in proportion to the abhorrence. The event is one
τοιοῦτον, οἷον καὶ στυγοῦντ᾽ ἐποικτίσαι, <ref>l. 1296</ref>.
And if, as in the death of Clytemnestra, the retribution had been the
direct consequence of the previous act, the emotion of wonder would
have been less powerfully stirred. But in the legend of Oedipus the
marvel of the discovery is an essential feature of the story, while
the strangeness of the punishment, partly self-inflicted, corresponds
to the strangeness of the crime.
2. THE TREATMENT OF THE FABLE (ἡ σύστασις τῶν πραγμάτων).
In no Greek drama is it so clearly evident that the treatment of
the fable, the σύστασις τῶν πραγμάτων, is the first thing, and that the
characters and sentiments are subordinate. The poet has directed
all his resources to the one object of enhancing the interest of the
plot; or rather of so arranging the incidents as to make the action
most impressive. This drama is not the representation of an ideal
passion, like the ambition of Macbeth or the jealousy of Medea or
Othello, nor of a type of character, as in Hamlet or Lear; but of a
life of impetuous action resulting in error and calamity. The whole is
viewed as the work of fate and of an inscrutable Divine purpose and
power; but the predestined event is made to appear as the result of
a series of minute incidents and of their effect on the temper of the
hero.</p><p>
The impression thus produced is the result of profoundly calculated
arrangement; but, in order to judge of this, the poet's intention must
be borne in mind. And the chief aim of the tragic poet is not like
that of the novel writer, to pique and prolong curiosity; nor, as in a
modern melodrama, to make complex preparation for an unexpected
denouement; but so to present the critical moments of a great life as
to move spectators powerfully by making them feel the emotions of
the ideal person on the stage. Hence, while simplicity rather than
complexity is the virtue of a tragic plot, the kind of probability required
in tragedy is relative to this main purpose and to the conditions
of representation. The spectator, as he is rapt onward from scene to
scene, has small leisure for weighing external probabilities. But, if
he is to be deeply moved, the connexion of the incidents immediately
presented to him must be natural and credible, and, above all, the
expression of feeling must be in perfect accord with the situation.
Yet even this is not the main condition. The skill of the poet is
chiefly shown in the choice and ordering of the moments to be

represented, in the use of gradation and contrast, and in the nameless
power of making the whole action live and move. Where this power
exists, an essentially incredible story will be felt as credible.
Sophocles is not wholly careless even of external inconsistencies.
If a spectator were quick enough to anticipate the objection of Aristotle
and Voltaire, that Oedipus could not remain so long in ignorance
of the circumstances of the death of Laius, he is answered by
Oedipus in person, who excuses himself to the people for having so
long neglected a problem to the solution of which he had no clue. It
is also hinted that the troubles which immediately followed the late
king's departure had absorbed the attention of the state. Any momentary
feeling of incredulity is thus sufficiently allayed. Still greater
care is taken with the direct antecedents of the action. Thus the
child, instead of being exposed and found, as in the old legend, is
given by the hand of the Theban to the Corinthian herdsman. This
circumstance appears to have been invented by Sophocles, who thus
prepares the way for the two cardinal scenes, in the first of which the
Corinthian at once inspires false hopes in Oedipus and reveals the
whole truth to Jocasta; while in the second the Theban, by a single
word,-not that for which he was brought, -suddenly flashes the
whole horror upon the mind of Oedipus.</p><p>
But it would be a serious error to dwell on the complexity of the
plot, however ingenious, as the prime merit of any Sophoclean tragedy.
The Oedipus can be more safely praised, as well as better
understood, when it is viewed more simply as a representation of
pathetic action and natural emotion. And it must be remembered
throughout that this particular legend was exceptionally familiar in
the time of Sophocles, and the name of Oedipus had long since
become synonymous with tragic horror. However much the
poet may have been interested in blinding Oedipus, he can have
neither hoped nor cared to make any mystery for the spectator.
His opportunities for exhibiting the pathetic blindness of his hero
are greatly increased by the fact that the outline of the fable was
generally known.</p><p>
1. The apparent position of Oedipus and of the Thebans could not
be more vividly displayed than through his intercourse with the suppliants
and with the aged priest who speaks for them. His power
and fame are seen to be established beyond question. He cares for
the people of Cadmus as if they were indeed his own people, and
they, in the day of their calamity, turn instinctively to their stranger
prince, who saved them when they were threatened with destruction
and whom they regard as only lower than the Gods.</p><p>
The generous, but impulsive and self-confident, character of Oedipus
is also clearly marked from the first. He has no hesitation in
taking on himself the whole burden of the people. He speaks not
of helping merely, but of rescuing them. He has eagerly thought
of many plans for their salvation. Nor has action lingered behind
thought; for he has already despatched Creon to Delphi. The
recital of previous circumstances, which a weaker dramatist would
have put into the prologue, is reserved for the time when Oedipus,
VOL. I.

OEDIPUS TYRANNUS.
no longer secure of the present, is led to dwell with anxiety upon
the past.</p><p>
Already in these few lines (1-150) the well-informed spectator
has had more than one hint to contrast the present state of Oedipus
with his future. He is anxious, forsooth, not for himself, but for the
Thebans! Well may the old priest warn him to take good heed!
We know that he shall indeed save his people, but through what
sacrifice! Little knows he the meaning of his words, when he promises
to avenge the murder, as if he were the son of Laius, and
so fulfil the purpose of the God!</p><p>
Preparation has been also made for much that follows. It is
Creon who brings the message from Delphi, and on Creon the
king's suspicion presently alights. The smoothness and harmony of
their relations, indicated in ll. 70, 85, are soon to be disturbed.
On receiving the message, which by his own choice is delivered
publicly, Oedipus once for all undertakes the quest, which leads him
to his doom. He then retires into the palace, the priests and suppliants
withdraw, and the stage is left empty.</p><p>
The Chorus of Theban elders (11. 513, 911, 1111, 1223) at their
first entrance make no reference to the position of Oedipus, which
has now been sufficiently put forward. They have been drawn to
the palace gate, not by the king's promise to save Thebes, but by
their anxiety to know the tenor of the oracle. They invoke, not
Oedipus, but, as becomes their dignity, Apollo, Athene, Artemis,
Dionysus, the divine protectors of Thebes (ll. 151-215).</p><p>
But Oedipus is ready to answer for Apollo. His royal proclamation,
although founded on the response which he has obtained from
Phoebus, is given forth entirely in his own name. The character
and apparent position of the chief person are again marked with
stronger and broader lines. But the main intention here is to prepare
for the catastrophe and to make the ultimate self-conviction
of Oedipus appear more terrible, through the form of speech in which
he at the outset denounces the offender. Each spectator must have
felt, as the grandiloquent lines were slowly uttered, that the king was
entangling himself more inextricably at every word in the toils of
his own elaborate curse; and this so unconsciously, that with fatal
maladroitness he lays a formal and complacent emphasis on the very
points which, rightly understood, are the most horrible. He is no
longer a foreigner, he says, but a Theban citizen: he has succeeded
to the place of Laius in the kingdom, and in the royal bed! Their
offspring-had but Laius' offspring lived and prospered-might have
claimed one mother! (ll. 216-275).</p><p>
2. The ground-work has now been laid, and after a brief interval,
during which Oedipus confers with the Coryphaeus (ll. 276-296), the
action is disturbed and complicated by the coming of Teiresias. He
does not, as in the Antigone, arrive unbidden. Every step in the
revelation, except the visit of the Corinthian shepherd, who comes for
another purpose, proceeds from Oedipus' own impetuous action. He
has sent for the seer at the suggestion of Creon, who has thus unconsciously
planted another seed of suspicion in the mind of the king,
<pb n="111"/>
INTRODUCTION.
115
and, on his not coming instantly, he has sent for him a second time.
Nor is the prophet here, as elsewhere, the immediate harbinger of
the catastrophe. That office is reserved for the Theban slave, whose
twofold knowledge makes his rustic garb more dreadful than the prophetic
mantle. But Teiresias' entrance greatly heightens the interest
of the situation and assists the main impression. The hush that precedes
his coming; the awe-struck mention of his name; his evident
reluctance to come; the cloud that lowers on his countenance at the
sight of Oedipus; his resolute silence, all point to the impending
horror.</p><p>
As he comes unwillingly into the presence of Oedipus, he for the
first time fully realizes the dreadful consequences of the truth which
he knows, and while all look eagerly towards him, he refuses to speak.
Then Oedipus, with passionate vehemence, but not ignobly, for he is
still moved by public zeal, accuses the prophet of complicity in the
crime. And Teiresias, who is prince as well as seer, is provoked
in turn, and with proud words declares the king himself to be the
pollutor of the land.</p><p>
To Oedipus the words seem nothing but an outburst of impotent
rage. He dares Teiresias to repeat them, and the accusation of incest
is added to that of murder. But such charges can have no
meaning for Oedipus. He is simply amazed at the insolence of the
blind prophet, whom he taunts with being blind inwardly no less, and
with being the minion of Creon, against whom the suspicion of the
'tyrant' now blazes forth. This raises the wrath of Teiresias to the
height, and he utters a parting speech of solemn denunciation, which
only enrages Oedipus, but leaves deep disquiet in the minds of the
Theban elders and strikes the spectator with the contrast between
the clear vision of the blind seer and the fatal blindness of the clearsighted
Oedipus (ll. 297-462).</p><p>
The stage is again vacant, and the Chorus give utterance to their
distracted thoughts, echoing two notes, which are hereafter to blend
in one, the quest for the murderer, whom they imagine as flying far
away, and the dreadful suggestions of Teiresias, which they are too
loyal to believe (ll. 463-512).</p><p>
3. The action, after being thus far developed and complicated,
is now held in suspense. To borrow a felicitous image, we have
climbed the chief ascent, and are led along a table-land towards the
precipice. Or rather we see Oedipus, who has been shaken from his
fixed place and lifted from the solid earth by his passionate resentment,
borne to and fro by opposite winds, and beating the air. Creon
indignantly but not intemperately repels the charge of treachery, which
the king reiterates. The contention is becoming very sharp, and the
elders are again distracted between their attachment to Oedipus and
their care for Thebes, when Jocasta enters 'with timely coming to
appease the strife' (ll. 513-633).</p><p>
She endeavours to soothe Oedipus (11. 707 ff.) by showing him that
no account is to be made of prophecy. To prove this she relates how
Laius was slain, not, as the oracle had foretold, by the hand of his son
the poor child lived not three days-but through a chance meeting
12
<pb n="112"/>
116
OEDIPUS TYRANNUS.
with some wayfarers at a cross-road. The mention of the cross-road,
intended by Jocasta to mark the fortuitous nature of the occurrence,
recalls vividly to the mind of Oedipus his own half-forgotten deed.
All at once he fears, lest he may be the man whom the oracle and
his own curses have proscribed, and lest the saying of Teiresias may
prove true. He elicits from Jocasta that Laius was elderly, but tall;
she adds, 'in figure not unlike thyself;' and that the place was
where the roads to Thebes from Delphi and from Daulia meet. Convinced
that he is the outlawed person, the murderer of the man whose
kingdom and whose wife he holds (than which he can imagine nothing
more horrible), he still contains himself so far as to ask for the
eye-witness of the deed; who may confirm or remove the frail hope
which Oedipus now finds in the report that this Theban slave, the
same of whom he thought so lightly when the Coryphaeus mentioned
him before (ll. 118, 9, 293), had spoken of the murderers of Laius
in the plural number. He learns that the man had been Jocasta's
confidential servant, and that, in requital for peculiar services, she had
yielded to his urgent petition to be allowed to return on Oedipus
appearing as the successor of the murdered king. When she desires
him further to tell his trouble, his whole past history rises to his lips.
His recital (11. 771-833) is not merely intended to inform the spectators,
although at this point it is especially needful that they should
realize the antecedents of the story. The narrative here has the
combined effect of (1) unfolding the affectionate, impulsive, confiding
nature of Oedipus when thoroughly moved; (2) of showing his
essential innocence through the horror he feels at what is only a
small part of the truth; (3) of pathetically marking the unconsciousness
of mother and son-(imagine the effect of 1. 811, where Oedipus
holds up his right hand); (4) of keeping the threads of the fable
together for the spectator; and (5) of retarding the action when approaching
the critical point. The exit of the king and queen again
leaves the stage vacant (1. 862).</p><p>
4. The choral ode (3rd stasimon) which follows this long scene
occupies the central place in the economy of the play, and may be
compared in this respect with ll. 583-625 of the Antigone, and Il.
668-719 of the Oedipus Coloneus. It prepares for the sequel, by
impressing on the spectator's mind the glory and sanctity of those
eternal laws which Oedipus will be presently found to have unwittingly
broken. This strain is immediately suggested by the impiety
of Jocasta in questioning the truth of prophecy (ll. 863-910).
After it is ended, there is a fresh meeting-point between the current
of circumstance and that of agitated feeling. Jocasta again
appears, not acknowledging her own misgivings, whatever they may
be, but describing to the Chorus the troubled condition of the king.
She invokes Apollo (whom she worships while gainsaying his ministers)
and prays for some release from the anxiety that is distracting
Oedipus, and through him troubling Thebes. But before she has
made her offering, a messenger from Corinth enters with news of the
death of Polybus and the expected succession of Oedipus to the
vacant throne. She is filled with exultation and thinks no longer of
<pb n="113"/>
INTRODUCTION.
117
Apollo. The oracle is falsified. Oedipus' father is no more, and
how can he again find room for fear? Oedipus, who enters at her
bidding, is greatly relieved, but though part of the prophecy is cancelled,
he still finds a root of bitterness in the other part. The Corinthian,
thinking to complete the joy of Oedipus, the sight of whom as
his destined sovereign revives the old man's fondness for his fosterson,
discloses the secret which he had hitherto kept. The king
may know that he is not the son of Polybus and Merope. But then
of whom? The answers of the Corinthian, who tells all he knows,
reveal this all too clearly to Jocasta. The whole weight of the calamity
suddenly falls upon her. And she must bear it alone. A horror
of darkness passes between her and her son, while he, in total unconsciousness
of the blow, is wholly absorbed in the passionate
desire, which had possessed him formerly and is now suddenly
renewed to know his origin, however mean or high. She goes her
way in dreadful silence and he remains upon the stage (ll. 911-
1085).</p><p>
The mental condition of Oedipus at this moment may be thus
conceived:-The agitation into which he has been thrown by
thinking that he is the outlawed regicide makes him more than ever
susceptible to new impressions. The news from Corinth finding
him in this mood produce a powerful reaction. The thought of
outlawry from Thebes, however dreadful in itself, was greatly aggravated
by his having no other home to fly to: seeing that Corinth,
to which his heart still clings, could not be approached by him while
his parents Polybus and Merope still lived. The message of the
Corinthian goes far to remove this obstacle. But for the lingering
fear about his mother Merope, which reason tells him not to listen to,
he might return to the land of his affections, and be her king. To
his spirit, that has been so tossed and shaken with doubt and fear,
this thought has an intoxicating charm. He has no longer any place
in Thebes, for which he once cared so tenderly, but the pain of this
separation is overborne by the new hopes and old remembrances that
crowd upon him. To have once slain a man who happened to
be king of Thebes would be no intolerable burden for the king of
Corinth. And when the last scruple has been removed, and he is
also on the point of solving the personal doubt, which has racked
his spirit in youth and coloured his whole history, Oedipus is infatuated.
He is possessed with a strange lightness, in which the troubles
of his Theban kingdom, and his fear of outlawry, are eclipsed by the
reawakened hopes of early days and the reckless impulse of discovery.
He is willing to be the child of Fortune, who has made him
great. For as the Corinthian monarchy was elective (ll. 939, 40),
the succession would not be affected by the question of birth. The
mental exaltation of Oedipus before the peripeteia is thus accounted
for, and psychological truth keeps pace with tragic effect.</p><p>
The Chorus, whose persistent loyalty is a high tribute to the worth
of Oedipus, are infected by his excitement, and suggest flattering
solutions of the mystery (11. 1086-1109).
Then the spokesman of destiny arrives. Like Teiresias he has
<pb n="114"/>

come unwillingly, and is unwilling to speak. For he knows that
Oedipus is the murderer of the king. But when the Corinthian shepherd
reminds him of the child of whom they both knew and declares
that Oedipus is he, the old man is horror-stricken, and only under
threats of torture from Oedipus, who is carried onward irresistibly,
can he be persuaded to confess the truth. For now he sees the
whole, of which only the half was known to him before. Oedipus
sees it at the same moment, and is overwhelmed with passionate despair.
Few words are said on either side. The death of Laius is not
once mentioned in this crowning scene (ll. 1110-1185).</p><p>
The Chorus now lament the utter fall of Oedipus, for whom they
still retain a mournful affection, and moralize over the instability of
human things (ll. 1186-1222).</p><p>
A messenger (ll. 1223-1296) reports the suicide of Jocasta and
the self-blinding of Oedipus, who presently reappears with eyes still
bleeding. His passion at first breaks from him in lyrical outbursts,
and afterwards in a connected speech. Both the 'commos' and
the 'rhesis' are amongst the most highly wrought in Sophocles
(11. 1297-1415). Before the final exit of Oedipus, the accumulated
horror has been softened into pity, by the humbleness of the great
broken heart before Creon, whom he had maligned so proudly, and
by his yearning tenderness over his children, who are brought to
receive his last farewell (11. 1416-1514). They are taken from him
again; and, as the solitary man is led away to darkness, the Chorus
utter some lines of moral wisdom, which allow the overcharged feelings
of the spectators to subside (ll. 1515-1530).</p><p>
We should have been better able to judge of the extent to which
the legend has been moulded by the art of Sophocles, if the Laius
and Oedipus of Aeschylus, and his satyric drama called the Sphinx,
had been preserved. The Septem contra Thebas' sufficiently indicates
(and the notices in Pindar, Ol. 2. 38, Pyth. 4. 263, point in the same
direction), that the story had been already considerably modified from
the simple form in which it appears in the eleventh Odyssey (271 ff.)
The disobedience of Laius had come to be regarded as the beginning
of a curse which fell on all his descendants. The solution of the
Sphinx' riddle, and the curse pronounced by Oedipus upon his sons,
had become parts of the story: the locality of the parricide at the
triple way, and the act of Oedipus in putting out his eyes, had been
already added. Some of these additions, or all of them, may have been
due to the Cyclic poets of the Tale of Thebes. But, if we may judge
from the Phoenissae of Euripides, the common version of the legend
followed the Odyssey in representing Oedipus as still reigning at
Thebes after the death of his mother-queen. This was inconsistent
with the tragic motive of Sophocles, who saw that the fall of Oedipus
must be complete. He has also left out, or deferred, Oedipus' curse
upon his sons, although a reminiscence of this part of the legend
may perhaps be traced in the passing mention of them in ll. 1459-61,
which heighten by contrast the tenderness with which he speaks
of his daughters. Oedipus thus retains to the last the sympathy of
<pb n="115"/>
INTRODUCTION.
119
the spectators, which a curse pronounced upon any of his children,
occurring at this moment, as in the drama of Aeschylus (S. c. T.
11. 778-790), would have alienated. One point of difference between
the two tragic writers is mentioned by the Scholiast on O. T. 1. 733.
He quotes three lines from the Oedipus of Aeschylus, in which the
'triple way' is placed near Potniades, in the Theban territory, probably
a seat of the worship of the Eumenides, where the legend of
Oedipus had been preserved. Sophocles, by selecting the spot on
the way to Delphi, has given a probable and natural connection to
the parts of the story. Again, in one version of the legend, as
G. Wolff has shown, the child of Laius was actually exposed, and
found. But Sophocles, by inventing or adopting the incident of his
transmission from hand to hand, has provided for the role of the
Theban servant who is the pivot of the whole action as treated by
him. The drunken word, which makes so deep an impression, but
is not thought worth remembering, is an invention of Sophocles.</p><p>
And there is some reason for thinking that he is original in choosing
Corinth, rather than Sicyon, or some small town in the neighbourhood
of Thebes, as the place where the foundling was adopted
and brought up. It is evident how much this contributes to the cohesion
of the plot. The visitation of the plague which occasions
the discovery may also have been added by the poet, and may have
been suggested to him by the opening of the Iliad, and possibly
also by the plague at Athens.</p><p>
The general characteristics of his treatment of the legend may
be stated with more confidence. He dwells less than Aeschylus
on the transmission of the curse from generation to generation,
although the idea was familiar to him in connection with the story
of Oedipus, as we know from several expressions in the Antigone.
The attention of the spectator is concentrated on the life of Oedipus
himself, and what most deserves notice is the extraordinary power
with which the high fortune of the hero, his supreme position in the
state, and the reverence of his people for him, are impressed on the
imagination, the verisimilitude with which his infatuation is sustained,
and the subtle and yet simple means by which the very
incidents which awaken hope, the response of the oracle, the recital
of Jocasta, the message from Corinth,-are made to be the precursors
of ruin.¹ The passionate temper of Oedipus, which is the cause of
the discovery, as before of the murder, gives an air of inherent probability
to the whole action, and is also finely contrasted with his selfrestraint
at critical moments in the conduct of the inquiry. The
fortunes of Thebes, which are made so prominent at the opening of
the drama, are lost sight of, as the action continues, in the intense
interest with which the fate of Oedipus as an individual is followed
to its consummation.</p><p>

OEDIPUS TYRANNUS.
3. STYLE (λέξις).
The effectiveness of this treatment of the myth is heightened by
the use of language, which, first of all, the poet, like Shakespeare in
Macbeth, has wisely made beautiful in proportion to the horror of
the subject; secondly, the style of the first 1150 lines has a serenity
and smoothness, which contrasts forcibly with the agitation of the
concluding passages. This tone of quiet self-possession is especially
marked in the commencement of the scenes in which the
great discoveries are made (924 ff., 1110 ff.). Thirdly, in a great
number of passages, the unconsciousness of the persons is shown by
the calm utterance of words, in themselves quite natural at the time,
which, if the speakers knew the truth, could not be used by them
without a thrill of horror. Such expressions have the effect of
reminding the spectator of the sad contrast between the appearance
and the reality. The exact limits of this kind of double meaning in
this play are a question of some difficulty for the interpreter. But the
existence of such an element in the language of the Oedipus Tyrannus
has been acknowledged by all commentators from the Alexandrian
Scholiasts downwards. Long study of the play and familiarity with
Sophocles may make it easier to distinguish between the true and
false assumption of this kind of motive, and may commend some
instances of it that appear doubtful at first sight. (See below, p. 130.)
It is more important, however, to remember generally, that the language
of the Oedipus Tyrannus is even more elaborate than that of
other plays of Sophocles.</p><p>
The metres also are elaborately varied in accordance with the range
of feeling expressed. The Paean-notes of the first chorus, and the
Ionic-a-minore passages of the second, are without parallel in
Sophocles. The dactylo-trochaics of the little ode which precedes
the peripeteia, although common elsewhere in lyric poetry, have
rarely been repeated by him. (But see Aj. 172 ff., Tr. 94 ff.) These
measures all contrast with the smooth glyconic strain which follows
the catastrophe, although this, too, presently changes to less ordinary
rhythms. The dochmiacs of the commation and commos are more
than usually intricate, and even in the senarii, the frequency of
trisyllabic feet, of which the motive is in most cases perceptible,
the prevalence in some parts of 'light endings' and the exclusion
of them in others, are indications of the fact that the metrical
composition of the Tyrannus, as well as the language generally,
has been worked up with more than usual care.</p><p>
4. THE PERSONS (τὰ ἤθη).
The characters of the persons in the Oedipus Tyrannus are extremely
simple, but are well adapted to produce the kind of interest
that is required. The generous and impulsive nature of Oedipus is
one that never forfeits sympathy, but is manifestly born to trouble.
The deep impression produced in him by a drunken word; the wild

flight into exile, on first hearing an oracle half understood; the sudden
blow, 'out of his grief and his impatience;' the glorious, but temporary
success; the undoubting self-confidence with which he takes
the burden of the whole people upon himself; his bursts of anger
against Teiresias and Creon, not brooking explanation; again, his
haste in condemning himself on the first doubtful surmise, and the
rash determination with which, dashing all else aside, he follows up
the clue to the secret of his birth, are traits making up a consistent
picture of an essentially tragic character. Not less impetuous afterwards
in his despair, he will believe that not death alone awaits him,
but that he is reserved for some more dreadful fate. And after the
bloody act against himself, he is bent on rushing forth immediately
into utter solitude. His remorse at the approach of Creon and his
tender love for his daughters, his affectionate devotion to his people
in the earlier scenes, and his open-hearted confidence with Jocasta,
are quite in harmony with his passionate nature, while they effectually
engage the sympathy of the spectator.</p><p>
Jocasta's marble resoluteness contrasts with the impressionable
excitability of Oedipus. While she believed the prophecy, she had
given her young child with her own hand for destruction, after having
seen her husband pierce its feet and tie them together. The pang
with which she hears the messenger relate this fact, is the first and
sole awakening of the maternal feeling so long suppressed. Yet by
this violence to nature she had not saved her husband from being
murdered. She now counsels Oedipus, to whom she is strongly attached,
to disregard the powers which have so deceived her. The peremptory,
imperious disposition of the queen, and the ascendency over her husband
and brother, which her strength of will has obtained for her,
are well indicated. While cold and reserved towards others, she
has a deep affection for Oedipus, which is perhaps intended by the
poet to have an instinctive source, and which appears most strongly
and is most warmly reciprocated, when the crisis is approaching, and
her impious confidence is at its height ¹.</p><p>
Creon, in each of the two chief scenes in which he appears, is the
impersonation of a cool reasonableness which serves as a minor contrast
to the excitement of the king. Unlike Teiresias, he keeps his
temper through the altercation, and in the concluding scene he will not
assent to Oedipus' entreaty to be cast forth, without again inquiring
of the oracle. He throughout remembers, what Oedipus everywhere
forgets, that his position in the state is prior to the exaltation of
Oedipus. His character, and the moralising aspect of the chorus,
have the effect of throwing the more passionate elements of the
drama into stronger relief.</p><p>
Teiresias makes a contrast of another kind. The celestial light
shining inwardly,' where all without is dark, gives a touching prominence
to the mental blindness of the clear-sighted Oedipus.
The quick resentment of the prophet when recklessly accused, may

appear strange, if we reflect that the real situation is completely known
to him. But it causes him to break silence, and we are to remember
that he is of the proud Cadmean line.</p><p>
The remaining persons are the aged priest who heads the procession
of suppliants, the messenger from Corinth, the herdsman of
Laius, on whom the plot chiefly hinges, the second messenger, and
the chorus of Theban elders. None of these are without character,
and all contribute something to the general effect. The pious modesty
with which the priest expresses his reverence for the king, 'not that
we account you equal to the gods: the heedless loquacity of the
Corinthian, who, in ignorance of the consequence of his words,
rejoices over Oedipus as a kind of foster son: the shrinking of the
too-faithful servant from the murderer of his master, even when he
knows less than half the truth, -all help to deepen the central impression.
Even the prosaic sententiousness of the second messenger
assists in heightening the interest of his recital, by showing how the
scene had roused a common nature.</p><p>
The Chorus stands in a peculiar relation to the chief agent. Caring
above all for Thebes, they are bound to Oedipus by gratitude for his
past services, and their loyalty to him is not easily shaken. Their
affection for the stranger-prince even makes them sympathise in his
illusions, and they are deeply affected by the catastrophe. Their
leader takes part in the action at three chief points, helping to introduce
Teiresias, attempting to mediate between Oedipus and Creon,
and preparing the spectators for the coming of the Theban slave.
But their chief function is to give utterance to the feelings which the
successive scenes are calculated to arouse in the spectator.</p><p>
In their first ode they express the grief and longing of the plaguestricken
people. In the second, they echo the curse against the
murderer, but, notwithstanding the dark saying of the prophet, remain
true to Oedipus. The central episode is broken by a commation,
(a minor lyrical dialogue in the midst of a scene,) in which they
renew the expression of their firm affiance, while deprecating the
king's anger against Creon. The Chorus here appear in the character,
which they often have to sustain, of an ineffectual mediator.
In the second stasimon the reaction from the impiety of the queen
lifts them into a region of devout aspiration which is higher than
their sympathy with Oedipus or their patriotic feeling. In the fourth
ode, consisting of a few lines, they are again in unison with the mood
of Oedipus, and in the concluding stasimon, as citizens of the city
which he saved, they lament over his fall. Their constancy, as has
been already said, is a continual tribute to his nobleness.
When Oedipus re-enters, and the commos begins, the gnomic
wisdom of the chorus forms a cold contrast to his passionate words,
and in the final trochees they recal themselves and the spectators from
weak lamentations to read the lesson of the catastrophe.</p><p>

5. THE IDEAS OR SENTIMENTS (διάνοια).
If it is asked, what were the leading thoughts of Sophocles in composing
this drama, it is not enough by way of answer to quote these
concluding lines, which are chiefly intended to give a finish to the
composition. And it may be well to ask in turn, In what sense is an
ancient dramatist expected to have leading-thoughts or 'ground-ideas?'
All tragedy aims at representing the sadness of life. The religious
spirit of Greek tragedy saw in error and calamity a proof of the
weakness of man and the power of the gods. And, in a reflective
age, such representations could not but be accompanied with many
thoughts on human destiny, which are necessarily coloured by the
poet's individual genius, and by the mind and circumstances of his
time. But the thoughts do not suggest the fable, and are not the
first or principal motive of the composition. They arise in the
progress of creation, as the tragic writer broods over the events
and incidents to which he is giving shape. They are inseparable
from the result, and contribute to the unity and impressiveness of
the effect. The peculiar nature of this and every kind of poetry is
greatly affected by the ideas which it expresses. But if by 'groundidea'
is meant a fixed thought which the poet brings with him to
determine the choice and treatment of his subject, the term is
founded on a misconception.</p><p>
The impiety of Jocasta, seen in the light of the approaching
catastrophe, suggests a strain of reflection on the danger of impious
pride and the eternal sovereignty of Justice and Truth. This helps
to give a moral meaning to the ancient legend, although the fable was
not chosen for the sake of the moral. So the fearful reverse of
Oedipus reminds the chorus and the spectators of the proverbial
uncertainty of human things and the mysterious purpose or envy of
the gods. There are other turns of thought, belonging to the age,
which the poet has adapted to the differences of situation and character.
The considerations which Creon urges respecting the advantages
of influence without actual power, are the same with those
which Histiaeus is represented by Herodotus as putting before
Darius; and the rationalism of Jocasta about the oracles, about
fortune, and about Divine things, is not unlike what is often met with
in Thucydides. Amongst these various paths of meditation, that
which lies deepest is the conviction, which seems to have been
gaining ground amongst thinking persons, that the most sacred laws
are written only in the heart, ὅσοι ἄγραφοι ὄντες αἰσχύνην ὁμολογουμένην
φέρουσιν (Thuc. ii. 37).</p><p>
But altogether apart from separate reflections, the whole situation,
as treated by Sophocles, has a profound ethical significance. In displaying
before us so vividly the horror of the loss of innocence even
through an involuntary act, he has impressed anew on every feeling
heart the infinite value of integrity and purity. And still more generally,
the utter ruin of a life, as represented by him, while it strikes
us with awe, has also the effect not of lowering but of greatly intensifying
our interest in human things.</p><p>

6. RELATION TO OTHER PLAYS.
Other plays of Sophocles, of which the fable was taken from the
Tale of Thebes, are the Antigone, the Oedipus Coloneus, and the
Eriphyle or Epigoni, two names supposed by Welcker to belong to the
same play. Of this, however, only a few lines have been preserved.
The Antigone is said, in the argument attributed to Aristophanes
the grammarian, to be the thirty-second play of Sophocles in order of
production, and the legend preserved by the same authority, which
connects this drama with the command of Sophocles in the Samian
war, assumes that it was written before 440 B.C. Whatever weight
is to be attached to these data, they throw no direct light on the
order of composition of the Oedipus Tyrannus and the Antigone.
But there are several internal indications of the Antigone being the
earlier of the two. (1) Notwithstanding the great strength and beauty
of the Antigone, the Tyrannus gives a deeper impression of maturity
and of concentrated artistic power. There is less mention of the
power of fate and fewer of the common-places of the earlier tragedy.
Such general considerations have, indeed, but an uncertain value.
There are, however, some observations of detail of which the force
can be made more evident. The first of these is the difference of
metre. The anapaestic measures of the parados, and those which
accompany the entrances of Creon, Antigone, Ismene, and Haemon,
have often been remarked as notes of an earlier style in the Antigone;
and the introduction of the commation in the middle of a long
episode in O. T. 649 ff. (cp. O. C. 834 ff.), may be thought to betray
the later composition of this drama.</p><p>
(2) There are certain topics which are common to the Oedipus
Tyrannus and Antigone, the interview of the king and prophet, the
suspicion of the tyrant, the sudden exit of one bent on suicide, similarly
misunderstood by a person who is nearly interested. In both
there is an appeal to the sanctity of the unwritten law. Let any one
compare closely the parallel passages in the two plays in which these
topics are treated, making due allowance for the difference of situations,
and he will hardly resist the impression that what in the
Antigone is a hint or first thought, has received more complete elaboration
in the Oedipus Tyrannus. The noble lines in which Antigone
sets the eternal principles against the edict of Creon, have all the
fervour and some of the sharpness of a first utterance; the opening
of the second stasimon of the Tyrannus has more of depth and
serenity. The part of Teiresias is much more highly wrought in
the altercation with Oedipus than in the scene with Creon in the
Antigone.</p><p>
(3) If we are to believe the tradition that Sophocles was made
general in B.C. 440 because of the Antigone, and also assume that the
plague at Athens and the disorders attendant on the Peloponnesian
War have left their traces on the Oedipus Tyrannus, a large interval
is set between the two plays. But this double assumption is too
uncertain to build upon.

INTRODUCTION.
125
The relation of the Oedipus Tyrannus to the Oedipus Coloneus
may be reserved for the introduction to the latter play-which on
many grounds may be assumed to be subsequent to the former in
the order of composition. The interpretation of the earlier drama is
little affected by considerations taken from the later one. They are
not like the parts of a trilogy, or of an epic poem, in which every part
throws light on every other and on the original design, but only productions
of the same mind working in kindred subjects at different
times.</p><p>
7. STATE OF THE TEXT.
The Oedipus Tyrannus, being one of the three plays most constantly
read, was much more frequently copied than the Oedipus
Coloneus or even the Antigone, and the pages of L (MS. Laur. 32, 9)
which contain it have been much corrected. The traditional text is,
however, on the whole remarkably consistent, and presents few places
where there is any obvious uncertainty. That it takes us further
back than to the first hand of L. appears from 1. 800, omitted by
L. p. m., which is found in several MSS. anterior to the hand which
has inserted it in L. mg.; and also from 1. 896, where the words
πονεῖν ἢ τοῖς θεοῖς in the text of L. are a corruption of πανηγυρίζειν τοῖς
θεοῖς which appears as part of a gloss in Trin. R. 3, 31, and some
other MSS. Other readings, e. g. 1. 193, ἄπουρον, <ref>l. 229</ref>, ἀβλαβής,
have such a wide currency in other MSS. including those of Sec. 13,
that they are probably also derived from some earlier source. But
the universal corruption of several lines, e. g. 281, 494, 876, 892,
1102, 1217, 1279, 1505, 1526; and the general agreement in a
perverse division of the lyrical parts, point to a common source of
all the remaining MSS. belonging to a time when the tragic dialect,
and especially the tragic metres, had been to a great extent forgotten.

NOTE.
ON THE SO-CALLED IRONY OF SOPHOCLES.
THE interest of dramatic poetry is necessarily sustained by contrast.
The tragic poet especially, whose whole aim is to impress on the
spectator, through sympathy, the effect of great vicissitudes upon a
noble heart, must have continual recourse to this means of vivifying
his work. And as the change which falls on men unlooked for has
the most effect on them, he is often led to indicate the unconsciousness
with which his imaginary persons go to meet their doom.</p><p>
To this contrast between the apparent and the real situation, especially
where the unconsciousness of the chief persons is strongly
marked, it has of late been customary to give the name of Irony.
But in their treatment of this common motive dramatic poets differ
according to the spirit in which they regard the sadness of life, and
also according to the fineness of their work and the degree in which
their art is artfully concealed. It was probably this latter ground that
suggested the brilliant Essay written in youth by the late Bishop
Thirlwall on the Irony of Sophocles. For it is certain that whatever
may be the true name for the expedient in question, it is used by
Sophocles like all else with singular grace and subtlety. But when
Irony is put forward as distinctively characteristic of the dramatic art of
Sophocles, or indeed as the leading feature of his method, it may be
doubted whether sufficient account is taken of the tone of feeling
with which the poet would have the spectator view the persons on the
stage, or of the degree and kind of sympathy which he intends his
different tragic persons to inspire. In the Antigone, for example,
the fate of Creon and that of the heroine are very differently treated.
Nor does anything in Sophocles so well deserve the name of Irony
as Aeschylus' representation of the triumph of Clytemnestra over
her husband; where the spectators have just been taught by Cassandra
to contrast the queen's present exultation with her impending
fall:-or as the treatment of Xerxes by Herodotus, or of Athens
by Thucydides in his 'Melian Controversy.' For the word 'irony'
in ordinary use and to the common apprehension implies the
absence or suppression of sympathy, and it cannot therefore be
applied indiscriminately to every kind of dramatic contrast. Indeed
it is singularly inappropriate to the embodiment of the nobler types
of humanity in the dramatic art of Sophocles. He may encourage
the spectator to be ironical towards Aegisthus and occasionally
<pb n="123"/>
INTRODUCTION.
127
towards Creon, but for Oedipus, for Philoctetes, for Electra, he
makes us feel too deeply to leave any room for irony.
The author of the great portrait statue of Sophocles (now in the
Lateran Museum) had a truer conception of the poet. There is
nothing ironical in the fulness of pure humanity that breathes from
every line of that noble figure.</p><p>
So much may serve by way of preface to the following remarks.
They were originally suggested by Bishop Thirlwall's Essay, first
printed in the Philological Museum (vol. ii. pp. 483-537) and lately
republished amongst his Literary Remains.
It has sometimes been attempted to embrace all the characteristics
of an artist or of a school of art in a single word. Such terms as
'ideal,' 'realistic,' 'sentimental,' 'euphuism,' 'romantic,' 'classical,'
have had an important influence on the criticism of art and literature,
and in their application have been often pressed beyond their legitimate
scope. Words properly applicable to painting or sculpture
are extended to poetry, without sufficient perception of the point
where the analogy fails. Or a word is used which roughly expresses
some general features of an artist's style, and is then made
to include other qualities which appear on a closer examination.
The new expression in such cases at first seems to teach something,
but is afterwards found to limit observation, to confuse thought, and
to strain the use of language.</p><p>
Something like this has happened in the use of the word 'irony' to
characterize the dramatic art of Sophocles.
Irony is not always humorous or malicious, but is always accompanied
with the consciousness of superiority. When one who
knows pretends ignorance and so makes his knowledge felt, or a
strong man assumes weakness and gives thereby a greater impression
of strength, or a proud man feigns humility and by outwardly affecting
to be lower places himself higher, or when a weak adversary is
represented as strong, or an ignorant disputant as learned and wise,
this kind of dissimulation, prompted by confidence, is called irony.
We cannot speak of an irony of feeling, because irony consists in
a certain relation of feeling to expression. And by a 'practical irony'
we can only mean a course of action which, taken as an expression of
feeling, is analogous to ironical language. The treatment of Ajax by
Athena in the first scene of the Ajax of Sophocles may fairly enough
be regarded as an instance of this.</p><p>
By a bold personification, we speak of the Irony of Fortune or the
Irony of Fate. By which we mean little more than the striking contrast
of conditions in the life of the same person, and each man's
ignorance of 'what a day may bring forth.' We do not speak of an
Irony of Providence, because we do not attribute to the Supreme
Being either the need of dissembling or the desire of making a display
of superior power. The ancient Greeks have nowhere used such
an expression, although εἰρωνεύεται ὁ θεός would seem at first sight to
be no inapt rendering of their popular conception of the dealing
of God with man, inflating his vain glory with the appearance of
<pb n="124"/>

success in order to cast him down from his pinnacle into the depths
of misery. And we feel on further reflection that it could hardly have
been thus used in seriousness by the great Attic writers, not merely
because the word always retains in Greek a slight association of
blame, but because the thing is inconsistent with the higher Greek
notion of the tenour of Divine action. If the Gods hid their purposes
for a while and seemed to delay their judgments, this was not
merely to prove their own wisdom, but to execute justice in the
earth. The gods of Aristophanes, perhaps even the deity of Herodotus,
might be represented as indulging irony, but not the beings
who were reverenced by Aeschylus and Sophocles. They might be
regarded sometimes as cruel and deceptive, more often as righteously
severe, but to speak of them as using irony would have seemed to
lower them. For irony is not the natural language of absolute
power, but of power which for the moment is withheld. Once more,
we may remark that there are passages in other poets, to which the
word may be more naturally applied than to anything in Sophocles,
e. g. to the scene in the Bacchae, Il. 912-976, where the supposed
Stranger leads Pentheus into the forest. But even here the spectator's
sense of the omnipotence of Dionysus renders the word
'ironical' most inadequate, even if applicable, to characterize the
treatment of the mortal by the God.</p><p>
The proper place for irony in literature is in argument. Either the
case of an opponent is eloquently and persuasively stated just before
it is reduced to absurdity, or some question, asked 'in all humility,'
touches the weak place as with the point of a needle; or some
ridiculous parallel is put with respectful gravity.</p><p>
The Platonic
Socrates abounds with instances of all these forms, and his profession
of ignorance is an ironical mask. No one can miss the meaning
of the term as applied to Plato's dialogues generally.
But when the Irony of Sophocles is spoken of, we have a right to
ask for a clearer explanation than the word in this application has
received.</p><p>
We are told¹ first, that there is an earnest irony, in which conviction
and feeling are repressed by their very strength. It is true
that there are feelings too strong for words; but it depends on the
nature of the feeling whether the eloquence of silence can be justly
termed ironical. Inexpressible contempt, for instance, may be shown
by silence, and if the silence is accompanied by some gesture of
feigned respect, this is 'practical irony.' But what of the dumbness
of amazement, or the silent gaze of pity? Is anything gained for
thought or language by terming these ironical, because the person
knows or perceives what he will not express?</p><p>
We are also told of 'the look which a superior intelligence, exempt
from our passions, and foreseeing the consequences of all our actions,
would cast upon the tumultuous workings of our blind ambition and
our groundless apprehensions, upon the phantoms we raise to chase
1 See the well-known Dissertation on the Irony of Sophocles in the Philological
Museum, vol. ii. pp. 483-537.

INTRODUCTION.
129
us or to be chased, while the substance of good and evil presents
itself to our view and is utterly disregarded ¹.' Now if such a being
is supposed to withhold his warning voice that he may see out the
spectacle of our folly and misery, and prove himself wiser than we
are in the end, that may again by a stretch of language be called
practical irony, though it would seem to be necessary that he should
communicate his triumph to some one for there is no irony in mere
feeling. But this is not the temper in which superior intelligences have
been supposed to regard the 'pranks which frail man plays before
high heaven;' nor is it exactly the temper even of the Greek gods.
They are not cold speculative beings, but strong, determined natures,
whose envy is another word for justice, and who are not bent on
making a show of power or wisdom, but simply on bringing to pass
their righteous but mysterious will.</p><p>
Then we are reminded of the 'irony of fate or of fortune,' as
exemplified in the high prosperity which, as in the case of Xerxes or
of Athens, immediately precedes the most ruinous disaster. Of this
irony the tragic poet is said to be the exponent. He is in the place
of fate or of Providence to his mimic sphere. Considered in this
aspect, the thesis deserves to be considered a little more closely.
Is the Irony of Sophocles, then, an irony of the poet, or of an
imaginary Fate or Providence, or, thirdly, of the spectator?
Is the poet in arranging his plot supposed to find a peculiar pleasure
in knowing the end from the beginning, and to be conscious of
a certain superiority over the imaginary persons, who strut their hour
upon his stage, and, in a less degree, over the audience whom he
keeps waiting for the catastrophe ? Every writer of fiction has the
same opportunity with the tragic poet of doing what he will with the
persons of his fiction, and keeping the reader or hearer in suspense.
But what artist ever thought in this way about his work? What Greek
artist ever thought of anything but the work itself and the end of the
work, which in the case of the dramatic poet is the impression to be
produced upon the spectators? The motive of the dramatist can no
more be studied apart from his audience than the ideal of the sculptor
or musician can be separated from the senses of sight and hearing.
The intention of the poet is one with the feeling of the spectator. If
irony was what the spectator enjoyed, then irony was what the poet
meant, but not otherwise.</p><p>
We are brought, then, to look at the question from the point of
view of the Greek spectator, who, be it remembered, is a very
different person from the modern critical reader. We have already
dismissed as unmeaning the phrase 'ironical feeling;' but it is still
possible that the feeling of the spectator may have been analogous
to the interest with which a bystander watches an exhibition of
irony.</p><p>
1. It is not to be denied that the Greeks delighted in witnessing
any clever deception and this is a motive which in various forms
re-appears in different parts of their literature, from the dream sent

by Zeus to deceive Agamemnon into deceiving the people, to the
entrapping of Thrasymachus by Socrates. How far some feeling
allied to this may have entered into the complex charm of tragedy,whether
in short in this also as in the pleasure of comedy there was
an element of φθόνος¹, is a question of considerable subtlety, and one
which the use of a word of doubtful intention rather helps to obscure.
In some places it is manifestly present, as when Electra addresses
words of double meaning to Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, who do not
know that they are in the power of Orestes 2. The same feeling may
exist in other places, where it is less obvious at first sight. But to
draw forth this latent element and treat it as the prevailing characteristic
of Sophocles, is to superinduce over Greek tragedy a
superficial form which it does not really wear, and greatly to injure
its essential simplicity and depth.</p><p>
2. The Greeks, like other people, delighted in contrast, especially
in the contrast between apparent and real fortune. This is one
amongst several reasons of what has been thought an anomaly in
the Iliad-the long continued successes of the Achaeans before the
fulfilment of the promise given to Thetis in B. i. The Greeks of
the fifth century B. C. had become profoundly aware of the actual
contrasts in life and history, and in reflecting upon these had formed
the conception of a jealous and vindictive Deity, who in some
inscrutable way was also just and good, who visited offences to the
third generation, and led on the proud and presumptuous man insensibly
to his fall. This thought, which throws a shadow over the
narrative of Herodotus, was essential to the life of tragedy; to the
work of Aeschylus even more than of Sophocles. But is every contrast
between appearance and reality to have the name of irony?
Must not this depend on the spirit in which the contrast is regarded?
And what was the frame of mind with which the spectator saw the
culmination and overthrow of the power of Agamemnon or Oedipus?
Did he mentally assume the position of a superior being, watching
with tranquil interest the ignorance and vainglory of an ephemeral
creature, or, like the refined critic of a later age, 'hold the balance
even' between conflicting interests? Or was he swayed by the
emotions of pity, awe, and fear; with pity for the human victim of
fate and circumstance, with fear of the mysterious Power to which
men seem to be as waifs in the stream, a fear, however, in which
there predominates an awful sense of the righteousness of Divine
retribution, not unaccompanied with occasional questionings of spirit;
as if man were striving to pierce beyond the apparent darkness of his
lot? If the latter description is nearer to the truth, it is mere confusion
to speak of such feelings as the enjoyment of irony. Still less
can the word be made to include the inverse contrast which constitutes
the interest of dramas of reconciliation, like the Philoctetes and
1 Plat. Phileb. 50. A subtlety that has
escaped Plato may be considered questionable.
The mixture which he finds
in tragedy is evidently θρήνος καὶ φόβος
+ ἡδονή.

the Oedipus Coloneus, where the opposition is between the apparent
or present misery of the chief person and his ultimate happiness-the
interest being sustained by incidents which retard without preventing
the attainment of this. Here the supporter of our thesis has to
maintain not only an irony of calamity, but of an irony of beneficence;

part of the Oedipus Tyrannus, for example, to be described?' I
can suggest nothing better than 'pathetic contrast.' But whatever
name may be given to it, the differentia of Sophocles is not here.
For this is common to him with all great writers of tragedy, and even
in his subtle use of it he is occasionally rivalled by Shakspeare. When

Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.'-Shak. Cymb. ii. 3.</p><p>
Her innocent fancy plays unconsciously upon the cruel truth. But is
this irony or pathos³? And there is pathos, though of a sterner kind,
where the Soothsayer is introduced to Caesar by Casca and Brutus
(J. C. i. 2), or where Cassius, who is himself working upon Brutus to
his harm, says, 'It is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes;'
or where Duncan says of Cawdor before Macbeth, 'It is a gentleman
on whom I built an Absolute trust;' and of a more tragic kind where
Desdemona says in answer to Emilia's 'Is he not jealous?' 'Who,
he? I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from
him.' But irony is no word for this. The Scholiast has a better
name for such expressions, when he says, καὶ τοῦτο κινητικὸν τοῦ θεάτρου
The audience must have been moved here.' In an ancient tragedy,
unlike the modern novel, the hearer knew the outline of the story.
The difficulty of sustaining interest was thus increased, and at the
same time greater opportunities were given for exhibiting contrast,
which could be held forth not only retrospectively but by anticipation.
In numberless places the unconsciousness of the persons adds greatly
to the effect, and the impression of such unconsciousness is heightened
by the calm serenity of the language, which is like 'the torrent's
501.
Phil. Mus. vol. ii. pp. 488, 489, 500,
2 What meaning would there be in describing
the angel in Parnell's 'Hermit' as
acting ironically? And yet the term is
more nearly applicable in this case than in
that of the Oedipus Coloneus.
Similar touches in comedy are often

pathetic and not ironical, as when Hero
says of Beatrice (in Much Ado, iii. 1)-
'I'll devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with. One doth
not know,
How much an ill word may empoison
liking.'

OEDIPUS TYRANNUS.
smoothness ere it rush below.' But this subdued tone, or litotes, is
sufficiently explained by the love of contrast, without inopportunely
bringing in the notion of irony ¹.</p><p>
3. Any intention of the poet apart from the impression which he
aims at producing, is merely imaginary, and in the impression at which
Sophocles aimed, the effect of irony was accidental and occasional, not
necessary or universal. Considered in this aspect, the word does not
truly express the ruling motive of his art. But there is still a lurkingplace
for the theory which has not been fully explored. The tragic poet
could not but convey to the people his own conception of the Divine
working. Was not irony an essential element of that conception in the
mind of Sophocles? Some reasons for denying this have been already
given. It is inconsistent with the highest reverence. It does not agree
with the conception of perfect strength. We may now add that in so
far as the opinion of Sophocles on this subject can be distinguished
from the dramatic motives of which we have already spoken, he seems
to have risen above the common notion of the vindictive and jealous
nature of the gods. He certainly had not exchanged this for the
refined cynicism of believing in a Deity of clear perceptions and
narrow sympathies. A deep sense, not of the Divine irony, but of
the Divine power as shown in the wonder and the mystery of human
life, is that which gives to his dramas much both of their substance
and their form.</p><p>
The truth which this phrase, 'The Irony of Sophocles,' is intended
to comprehend in one, is better expressed by speaking separately-
(1) of the power of God as an element in Greek tragedy; (2) of the
effect of contrast in exciting wonder, and intensifying pity and fear;
(3) of the subtle use of language in pointing contrasts through litotes,
double meanings, and suggestions of the truth; (4) of the ethical
genius of Sophocles, unobtrusively making felt the full meaning of
every situation; (5) of the pathetic force with which by a few simple
touches he stirs the deepest springs of feeling. The temptation to
embrace things so diverse in one word, has arisen from the peculiar
subtlety and humanity with which Sophocles has employed the idea
of Fate, from his artistic reserve, or parsimony, from the harmony of
his composition, and from the artifices which he has employed without
marring the simplicity of his art to send home the pathos of the
catastrophe.</p><p>
Sophocles is certainly a subtle writer, but all subtlety is not irony,
and subtlety is only one attribute of his genius. When he employs
irony, as all writers and speakers do sometimes, his irony has a high
degree of refinement.</p><p>
But to express the prevailing character of his works, the word
'irony' is at once too comprehensive and too narrow. Too comprehensive,
because implying the prevalence of a motive which only
enters partially and occasionally into particular scenes: too narrow,
because leaving out of sight the greater part of the impression

A similar effect is sometimes produced
not through the impression of unconsciousness,
but through presentiment:
e. g. in Hotspur, Cassius, Hamlet.

which the poet intended to produce. It confuses the feeling of the
spectator with a supposed intention in the mind of the author, who
in a dramatic writing necessarily stands behind his work, and with
the idea of Fate, or of the power of Zeus, which is weakened and
misrepresented by the use of the term ¹. It detracts from the simplicity
and tenderness which are amongst the chief merits of the Sophoclean
drama. It injures the profound pathos of Greek tragedy by suggesting
the suspicion of an arrière pensée, of the poet's face behind the mask,
surveying his own creations with a sardonic smile. It puts in the
place of the Athenian spectator, with his boundless susceptibility of
emotion, an imaginary reader or student, who has leisure to reflect on
matters external to the immediate action, and abundant calmness of
judgment to give a dispassionate verdict in the controversy between
God and man.
1 Passages like Aesch. Eum. 560, γελᾷ
δὲ δαίμων ἐπ᾿ ἀνδρὶ θερμῷ, are not the
literal expression of the poet's thought,
and they do not occur in Sophocles.</p><p>
ADDITIONAL NOTE ON Ο. Τ. 741.
Oedipus has no right to assume that Jocasta's former husband was
advanced in years; and, recalling the venerable appearance of the
man whom he slew, he hopes for a reply the very opposite of that
which he receives.</p><p>

    <p>Before the dialogue begins, the suppliants
are seen to enter on the spectator's
right, with wool-wreathed olivewands
in their left hands (Aesch. Suppl.
193). Marshalled by the Priests, they
eagerly approach the altars, on the steps
of which they lay their wands (Ib. 242).
Before this movement is completed,
Oedipus enters to them by the central
door. There was probably at least one
altar on either side of this, that of Apollo
Lycaeus (1.919) being one, and the
approach of Creon, who comes from the
country, would be seen by those on the
spectator's left (11. 78, 9), before becoming
visible to Oedipus or to the Priest
of Zeus, who remains on the right.

the tenderness not of Cadmus but of
Oedipus for his children; a rare use of
abstract for concrete. See Essay on
Language, p. 94. Κάδμου is gen. of
origin. O latest offspring of old Cadmus,
children who are my care.'
2. μοι is 'precatory,' adding a tone of
pleading affectionateness to the question.
Cp. Εl. 144, τί μοι τῶν δυσφόρων ἐφίει;
τίνας . . ἕδρας τάσδε.. θοάζετε = 'Why
do ye thus sit (or kneel) here with so
much haste?' The king in entering has
observed (or before entering has heard
from others, 11. 6, 7) the earnestness
with which the suppliants have taken
their places by the altars, and he regards
this as one of the signs of trouble in the
city. The meaning here given to θοάζω
is that which it has everywhere in Euripides,
who uses it frequently. Another
θοάζω = θάσσω is mentioned by grammarians,
and has been generally assumed to
be the verb found in this and two other
places of classical Greek, viz. Aesch.
Suppl. 595, Emped. 1. 18. But it is at
least questionable whether the meaning
'to hasten' is not admissible in both of
these. And in the present case it is unobjectionable.
For however slow and
staid the movements on the proscenium
actually were, they are often described
in the dialogue as rapid and hurried.
(El. 872, O. C. 887.) Cp. esp. Aesch.
Suppl. 209, μή νυν σχόλαζε, addressed
by Danaus to the suppliant maidens,
who are taking their places at the altar.
It must be admitted, however, that the
authority of Plutarch (de Aud. Poet. 2.
22 E) counts for something in favour
of the other meaning, and that it suits
the context equally well.

words prepare the hearers' minds for
the unwelcome intimation in 1. 97. The
construction of πάντα is difficult. Either
(1) by an extension of the subject, πάντα
is substituted in the resumption for τὰ
δύσφορα. <gloss>For I declare that even what
is troublous, if it but find right issue,all
in short will then be well.</gloss> Or (2)
πάντα is part of the predicate and has
the force of an adverb. Even what is
hard, if it but find right issue, will turn
out altogether prosperously.' Cp. Aj.
275, κεῖνός τε λύπῃ πᾶς ἐλήλαται κακῇ.
That which is troublous or burdensome
is the pollution of the murder, and its
right issue is the detection and banishment
of the murderer. There is no
reason to suppose any corruption of the
text. δύσθρο' (Heimsoeth conj.) would
suggest rather the rumour than the reality
of evils. λέγω shows that this is
Creon's construction of the answer and
not the answer itself.
89, 90, οὔτε, κ.τ.λ.] 'For thus far
I am not elated, nor do I anticipate
evil until I hear more.' πρό implies
that fear would be premature.
91. The formal words of Creon (cp.
Tr. 342 foll.) have the effect of making
Oedipus seal his own destiny by the
publicity which is given to the oracle.

που, which appears in several MSS,
would imply uncertainty, and would
therefore weakly express the security of
Oedipus. The literal meaning of οὔπω
is not to be pressed. From 'not yet' it
has passed into meaning simply 'never.'
Cp. Hdt. 3. 127, ὃς ὠφέλησε μέν κω

In
all these places, though past time is
spoken of, there is no opposition between
past and future. Or, as happens
with ἤδη, ποτέ, ἔτι, and other particles,
the notion of time is altogether lost.
Cp e.g. Hes Op. et D. 271, τά γ' ου πω

The inevitable unlikelihood is minimized,

Oedipus is still unconsciously drawing
the attention of the spectators to his
own part in the business. The person
to be avenged is his father, and he is
himself the author of the pollution, in
which he has so deep an interest
(αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ μύσος is suggested, though
not said), and of the crime which he
may one day wreak upon himself. For

'Might

the same word though in a different
connection (cp. l. 136, and see Essay
on L. § 44, p. 84) may have partly led
to the use of τιμωρεῖν here. But the
word is not inappropriate the murderer
may be supposed to have a grudge
against the crown-and by using it
Oedipus suggests the end, when he, the
murderer, shall inflict vengeance on
himself, the king, with the same hand
that had slain Laius. The conjecture
πημαίνειν is therefore not in point.
The words also prepare the way for
what follows, by betraying the first rise
of the feeling of suspicion in Oedipus
which presently fixes itself on Creon.

listen awfully for thy propitious voice,
oh sweet-tongued utterance of Heaven.
Paean, be our speed! What thing new
or old in season due dost thou disclose?
Tell us, thou voice, child of bright Hope
divine. Athena, Goddess, daughter of
the Highest, first hear our cry; thou,
Artemis, on thine encircled throne,
and archer Phoebus, come in threefold
might to save! if ever heretofore
ye banished sorrow from our state,
now too appear! For, oh! I am overwhelmed;
all my host is in disarray;
and there is no thought to save; Earth's
buds are nipped, and human births prevented
by the pains of death: soul after
soul takes flight with fearful speed, and
poor uncared-for corpses choke with
pestilence our unpeopled clime.
Wives, mothers, sadly suppliant, at
various altars groan; the voice of lamentation
mingles with the thrilling
hymn. Athena, send us help. and cause
yon flaming author of destruction, who
with dire noise advances, quickly to reverse
his speed and fly our land, whether
to Ocean or the restless Pontic sea.
Day ruins what night spares. O Father,
blast the plague-god with thy lightning.
Let thine arrows, O Apollo, be showered
to protect us, and Artemis' bright
torches from the Lycian hills; and thou,
O ruddy crowned Bacchus of the joyous
rout, with trooping Maenads, patron of
Thebes, draw near. and flash thy brand
against the god whom gods disown.'
The opening of this parodos is of the
nature of a paean (1. 186), or hymn to
Apollo as the god of victory or salvation.
The stately dactylic measures,
corresponding in strophe and antistrophe
even to the division of the words (cp.
153, 162, 158, 166), are only once interrupted,
as the chorus march towards
the altar, by the more meditative iambic
rhythm (11. 152, 160), and by the
anacrusis in 11. 154, 163.
The increasing excitement of the
chorus is shown in the second strophe
and antistrophe, by iambic and trochaic
rhythms with resolution of the arsis,
by the union of dactyls and trochees in
logaoedic lines, and by the more frequent
anacruses. The bright Paean

In the concluding strophe and antistrophe

of the thesis (or change to the cretic

broken by the sudden interjection and

person is more frequent, e. g. Aj. 862-863. κρῆναί τε ποταμοί θ᾽ οἶδε καὶ τὰ Τρωικὰ
πεδία προσαυδῶ. Athena, with her two
temples (1. 20), Artemis, conspicuous in
the Agora, and Ismenian' Apollo, are
the presiding deities of Thebes (11. 19-
22). As γῆ often = πόλις, so γαιάοχος
here = πολισσοῦχος.

<p><lem>κυκλόεντ'</lem> i.e. either (1) 'whose seat
is the round Agora,' or (2) 'whose seat
is in the round Agora.' In either case
κυκλόεντα belongs rather to ἀγορᾶs than
to θρόνον. Essay on L. p. 80. κυ-
κλόεσσαν ἀγορὰν θακεῖ would have been
an imperfect expression, and is supplemented
by θρόνον, which is cogn. accus.
The words suggest a sitting statue raised
so as to command the Agora, over which
the goddess presides. εὐκλέα, because
she is celebrated there with dance and
song. εὐκλέα is acc. sing. for εὐκλεᾶ.

The word may simply mean 'with death

may be paralleled from Aesch. Cho. 723,

excited tone of the chorus, cp. παιὰν

to repeat the same word within a few
lines, in a different connection (176,
ἀκτὰν πρὸς ἑσπέρου θεοῦ), is so strong in
Sophocles as to make such a repetition
probable even if not exactly appropriate

Clem. Alex. (130, ἔπουρος πνεύματι ἀλη-

authority for this use of the word. Cp.
ἐπουρίζω. The special meaning of oὗρος,

See Essay on L. p. 90, and cp. Tr. 467,
8, ταῦτα μὲν .. ῥείτω κατ' οὗρον. This

the gloss ταχύν in L³) is preferable to
ἄπουρον, (1) because yielding a more
natural rhythm, (2) because ἄπουρον,
though an early reading, acknowledged
by the Scholiast, is probably an emendation.
It occurs nowhere else, and
may have arisen from the apparent necessity
of connecting the adj. with

But the asyndeton and the break in the

against this. One Scholiast makes τέλει

also is παρεστάθην, which occurs in the
senarii, <ref>l. 911</ref>; cp. also Tr. 340, στα-
θεῖσ᾽ ἄκουσον. This is more probable
than either προσ-ταθέντα (προστείνω οςcurs
nowhere and would be meaningless
here) or προσταχθέντα, which has been
conjectured, but is hardly metrical (see
11. 192, 3). The arrows of Apollo are
spoken of in language properly applicable
to persons, as if they were an amy
bringing relief. There is also an allusion
to Apollo's attribute as προστατή-
ριος, Εl. 637. Cp. Aesch. Theb. 145,

formal emphasis with which Oedipus
dwells on his relation to the inquiry,
(ξένος μὲν .. ξένος δέ) throws a strong
light on his unconsciousness of the real
situation. Cp. infr. 259, 60, ἔχων μὲν

has remained a stranger to the

having hitherto neglected what he now
feels to be an imperative duty. Cp.
supr. 108, 9, 128. 9. 133, 4, infr. 566, 7.
It has been objected to this interpretation
that οὐ γὰρ ἄν necessarily means,
'Else had I not,' (sc. εἰ μὴ ξένος ἦν).
Cp. infr. 11. 318, 1456, 7. But no such
rule is absolute in tragic Greek, and no
tenable interpretation has been based
on this way of taking the words. The
'suppressed clause' is εἰ ἴχνευον, and
the general meaning is 'I could not be
otherwise than a stranger.' Although
the more usual mode of connexion would
be πῶς γὰρ-; the negative form, οὐ
γάρ, κ.τ.λ., is here more dignified. For

αὐτό, the reading of L and most MSS.</p>

of αὐτός. For μὴ οὐ with the participle,

6. 106, μὴ οὐ πλήρεος ἔοντος τοῦ κύκλου,
i. e. If the disk were not full, which
it was not.' So here, Unless I had
something to guide me, and I had nothing.'
The word σύμβολον (for which
see Ar. Pol. 4. 7, Pind. Ol. 12. 7), would
cause a thrill of horror to the spectators,
when they reflected that Oedipus had
Laius' blood upon his hand, and the

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="227-229"><p> The apodosis of this sentence
is dropped in Oedipus' haste to
give the assurance contained in πείσεται,
κ.τ.λ., and is imperfectly resumed in
ἄπεισιν.
The subject is changed from 'anyone
who has knowledge of the deed,' to the
murderer, to whom αὐτός refers.
Some obscurity also arises from the
appeal to fear (cp. infr. 234, 294) being
combined with the attempt to soothe
it (cp. Τr. 457, κεὶ μὲν δέδοικας, οὐ καλῶς
ταρβεῖς).
μέν in 227 points to the opposite supposition:-'he
may be one incapable
of fear.'
(1) And let the man himself, if he
be touched with fear, inform against
himself, by taking the guilt away with
him. For he shall suffer no further
penalty, but shall be unmolested in his
departure from the land.'
i. e. Instead of waiting for others to
convict him, let him convict himself by
going into voluntary exile, and taking
the offence from the land. The words
καθ' αὑτοῦ are to be construed κατὰ
σύνεσιν with 1. 226, sc. ποιείτω τάδε,
self-banishment being in this case equivalent
to self-impeachment :-
Let
Or (2) ὑπεξελών may be understood
proleptically, and σημαινέτω supplied
from κελεύω σημαίνειν, supra.
him inform against himself, and clear
the guilt away.
Οι (3) ὑπεξελών is to be taken in the
unusual sense of 'drawing forth from
concealment.' 'Let him obey me by
divulging the crime against himself.'
The last interpretation (3) is the simplest
(cp. Pind. N. 4. 8); but the first
(1) is on the whole the most probable.
The gentleness of Oedipus towards
the supposed self-convicted criminal is
contrasted with the fierceness of his
self-reproach in 11. 1369 foll., 1449 foll.,
infra.

which is therefore preferred. ἀβλαβής

230-2. The duty of the citizens generally
is clear. The only cases requiring
special mention are those of the murderer
(αὐτός), should conscience incline him
to obey, and of information against a
foreigner by one of his fellows. Cp.
1. 233. ἢ φίλου. This is the case contemplated
in these lines. Α μέτοικος

of the citizens, unless specially assured
that he would equally receive the reward.
And some one resident in Thebes
might be a fellow countryman of the
'stranger-robbers' (1. 715), who had
killed Laius in the triple way. The
obscurity of expression arises from the
effort to adapt the language to the case
of Oedipus. The οἰκέτης was in the
position of knowing another from another
land. Contrast 11. 231, 2, with
11. 1159, 1160, and cp. 1004. For the

and they would suppose the error to
have been caused by the recurrence of
ὑμῖν δὲ in 1. 273. But the plural, referring
to some 'person or persons unknown,'
is sufficiently justified by εἴτε
πλειόνων μέτα, and for the vague reference
of the pronoun ὅde, see Essay on
L. § 22. p. 34. Oedipus is careless
about the number; cp. supr. 107, 124
and note. The curse also falls indirectly
on those who disobey the commands in
11. 224-32, and 236-41. A slight inaccuracy
of language is no sufficient reason
for such a transposition. The conjecture
requires a further conjecture: ie. the
words must (1) have been omitted, then
(2) have been written in the margin,
and then (3) must have been wrongly
inserted before ὑμῖν δέ, <ref>l. 252</ref>, instead of
before ὑμῖν δέ, <ref>l. 273</ref>. It may be observed,
in defence of the existing text,
that the curse on the malefactor naturally
precedes the curse on those who
disobey the edict. The emphasis is on
κατεύχομαι. τὸν δεδρακότα is added
instead of a pronoun, referring to τὸν
ἄνδρα τοῦτον, because of τῷ δαίμονι and
τῷ θανόντι coming between. The words

The tone of the preceding speech as
a royal proclamation may be contrasted
with that of Creon in Ant. 163-210.
In both there is a mixture of self-confidence
with the strain of patriotism.
But in Creon these motives appear as
the bare assertion of a right, in Oedipus
as a spirit of generous readiness to
serve the state. In both there is an
unconsciousness of the situation. But
whereas Creon's unconsciousness involves
moral blindness and ignorance
of self, that of Oedipus is rendered more
pathetic by the purity of his intentions.

of the earlier MSS. This, however, is
not sufficient to decide between letters
so often confounded as ξ and χ. Common
usage is in favour of the future
(Ant. 261, οὐδ᾽ ὁ κωλύσων παρῆν). The
present tense, if genuine, is expressive
of certainty. There is one who convicts
him; i. e. He is already convicted,

πέφευγα. For the use of the present
participle without special reference to
present time, see E. on L. § 32. p. 55.

assisted by a supposed connection with

The double application of ῥῦσαι cannot
be expressed in one word in English.
The evil from which deliverance is
sought is made the object of the verb
of deliverance. Cp. Eur. Iph. A. 1383,
ταῦτα πάντα κατθανοῦσα ῥύσομαι. Although
this involves a slight change of
construction, it is better than to take
μίασμα ας = τὸ μεμιασμένον, <gloss>what lies
under pollution.</gloss> Even if such a rendering
be not impossible, the line so
explained adds nothing to what is already
said.

<p><lem>φεῦ, φεῦ .. φρονοῦντι</lem> ‘How terrible
it is to know, when knowing profits not!'
φρονεῖν often implies a feeling or intelligence
of the situation. E. on L. p. 93, 6,
Τr. 1145, φρονῶ δὴ ξυμφορᾶς ἵν᾽ ἕσταμεν :
Αj. 942, σοὶ μὲν δοκεῖν ταῦτ᾽ ἔστ᾽, ἐμοὶ δ᾽
ἄγαν φρονεῖν. So in this play, 302, фро-
νεῖς δ᾽ ὅμως, 326, μὴ .. φρονῶν γ᾽ ἀπο-
σταφῇς, 328, πάντες γὰρ οὐ φρονεῖτε.
Cp. with the present passage, Hdt. I.
46, where Croesus tries the oracles, ὅ τι
φρονέοιεν .. εἰ φρονέοντα τὴν ἀληθηΐην
εὑρεθείη. For the subjunct. in a relative
clause without av, see E. on L.
§27. p. 45. The indicative λύει would
make the application of the maxim too
pointed. This is the only place where
the expression, τέλη λύειν, occurs. λυ-
σιτελεῖν is frequent in prose writers,
and Euripides has repeatedly used the
simple λύειν in this sense. The present
expression appears to be an etymological
analysis of λυσιτελέω. The use of
λύει in El. 1005, λύει γὰρ ἡμᾶς οὐδέν,
'This tends not at all to free us,' is not
really similar. With the sentiment, cp.

evils that I know,' τὰ σὰ κ., <gloss>the evils
that you have to suffer.</gloss>) Unless μή in
1. 329 is taken as a mere rhetorical
repetition of the former μή, like οὐκ
in Ant. 6, (which does not seem probable
after οὐ μή, and gives a poor meaning
to the preceding words, as if the
motive Teiresias had for speaking were
merely that he might 'say his say,' or
as if he could speak and yet be silent),
the only tenable explanation of the
words as they stand is (1) to take ὡς ἂν
εἴπω μὴ τὰ σὰ as a separate clause, with
the ellipse of λέγω, as in the familiar
idioms ὡς ἂν εἰδῆτε (Aesch. Cho. 1021)
and ἵνα μὴ εἴπω (Lat. 'ne dicam,' Eng.
'Not to say-') Plat. Rep. 6. 487. D

and, for μή postponed, Phil. 653, ὡς

right, although a simpler context
may be obtained (2) by transposing εἴπω
and changing one letter: ἐγὼ δ᾽ οὐ μή
ποτε | εἴπω τάδ', ὡς ἂν μὴ τὰ σ᾽ ἐκφήνω
κακά. (For τάδε = τήνδε τὴν φάτιν, cp.

'Indeed!' The anger

that of Creon does where he uses the
same expression in Ant. 758. It is an
idiomatic utterance of extreme impatience,

(350-353) were not obscure, but their
meaning was too strange to be received
at once, and Oedipus in his anger affects to
treat them as a riddling utterance of the
seer. The apparent platitude indicates
the difficulty that Oedipus has in receiving
the new idea. Cp. infr. 439, Τr. 184, τίν'

The first strophe and antistrophe refer
to the proclamation of Oedipus reporting
the answer of the oracle; the second
to the words of Teiresias, which contained
the only answer yet given to the
question which the oracle left obscure.
The differing metres of the first and
second strophe and antistrophe contrast
the eager resolution of the chorus to
find the murderer, with the wavering
excitement which the words of Teiresias
have awakened, distracting them between
their loyalty to Oedipus and their
reverence for the seer. The first strophe
commences with a strain half grave, half
light, which is stirred into a quicker
motion in the glyconics (lines 466-8),
where the flight of the fugitive is described
and grows faster and also
weightier in the description of the tramp
of his pursuers (lines 469 ff.). In the

mind of the Chorus is indicated in the

city. In the first episode the action was
strikingly rapid. It contained the two
great movements of the proclamation
of Oedipus and the prophecy of Teiresias,
with only sufficient pause between
them (11. 276-96) to give effect
to the latter. Now follows a period
of suspense, for which the wavering
tones of the last chorus have prepared
the way. The scene is of unusual length,
11. 512-862, but is divided by the short
lyric measures (commatica) in 11. 649-
668, 678-696. Cp. O. C. 833 ff, 876 ff.

<p><lem>πᾶσι χαίρω</lem>
(1) ‘I am happy
in the sight of all.' Cp. Eur. Med.
509, πολλαῖς μακαρίαν. The recognition
of happiness is an element of happiness
to the sensitive Greek (as to Croesus in
the story of Herodotus); and the happy
man is saluted by all (πᾶς ἀσπάζεται),
just as the unfortunate is passed by
without regard. Cp Thuc. 6. 16, ὥσπερ
δυστυχοῦντες οὐδὲ προσαγορευόμεθα. Or
(2) I take pleasure in all men' (as
having no enemy). Cp. Od. 19. 462, 3,
τῷ μὲν χαῖρον νοστήσαντι. Other
renderings are, 'I am happy in my relations
with all;' 'I am happy in all
ways' (πᾶσι neuter); and, <gloss>All bid me
rejoice.</gloss> (Cp. χαῖρέ μοι.)
597. ἐκκαλοῦσί με is 'Invite me forth,'
or, 'Take me aside,' e. g. from the
palace or the council for private conference,
as an important person. Cp.
951, τί μ' ἐξεπέμψω δεῦρο τῶνδε δωμάτων;
Ant. 18: Eur. Bacch. 170, τίς ἐν πύλαι-

Κάλχας μεταστὰς οἷος Ἀτρειδῶν δίχα,
κ.τ.λ. Aristoph. Ach. 400-2: Hdt. 8.
79, ἐξεκαλέετο. The conjecture of L.
Dindorf, αἰκάλλουσι, suggests a disagreeable
association of mean flattery.

is not a fatal objection to the reading
αὐτοὺς ἅπαντ᾽. Cp. infr. 856. And
for the accus. cp. Eur. Or. 761, τύχοις

εὐχερὴς παρῇς. And for the article with
the subject in such a connection, cp.
Ant. 951, ὁ μοιριδία τις δύνασις δεινά.
624-625. The text of these lines is probably
defective. Two things seem clear;
(1) that line 625 is more appropriate
to Creon than to Oedipus, <gloss>You speak
as if you would not relent nor believe
me.</gloss> (MS. Farn. had upe. before this
line by p. m.) Cp. infr. 646, πίστευ-
σον, Οἰδίπους, τάδε: 650, τί σοὶ θέλεις
δῆτ᾽ εἰκάθω; Αj. 371, ὦ πρὸς θεῶν ὕπεικε
καὶ φρόνησον εὖ: and (2) that line 624
is addressed by Oedipus to Creon, and
conveys a threat: 'When you have
given an example of the crime of envy.'
Cp. Ant. 308, πρὶν ἂν | ζῶντες κρεμαστοὶ
τήνδε δηλώσηθ ὕβριν: ib. 325, 6, έξε-
ρεῖθ᾽ ὅτι | τὰ δειλὰ κέρδη πημονὰς ἐργά-
ζεται: Τr. 1110, 11, ἵν᾽ ἐκδιδαχθῇ πᾶσιν
ἀγγέλλειν ὅτι | καὶ ζῶν κακούς γε καὶ
θανὼν ἐτισάμην: Ant. 1242, 3, δείξας ἐν
ἀνθρώποισι τὴν ἀβουλίαν, | ὅσῳ μέγιστον
ἀνδρὶ πρόσκειται κακόν (ⅰ.e. προδείξας οἷόν
ἐστι τὸ κακῶς βουλεύειν) : Pind. P. 2. 42.
By transposing 624, 5, as Haase suggested,
a kind of meaning may be
brought out. <gloss>My desire for you is
death, not banishment.</gloss> 'You speak
as if you would not relent.' 'I will
relent when you are made an example
of the sin of envy' (and not before).
'(My envy is) that I see you to be unwise.'
But the transitions are too
violent. Again, 623, 4, may be read
continuously, and the loss of a single
line supposed after 625. <gloss>I would
have you be (not banished but) slain,
when you have first been made an example
of the crime of envy (in the
manner of your death).</gloss> 'You speak as
if you would not relent nor believe me.'
['And you speak like a rebel.'] 'Because
I see you blind.' But the insertion
(διὰ μέσου) οἱ οὐ φυγεῖν, and the
abruptness of ὅταν προδείξῃς, may be
thought to prevent the two lines from
coalescing into a harmonious sentence.
In this case the most probable inference
would be that one or more lines have
been lost before 624 and after 625.
The old explanations of the Scholiast,
When you have shown the nature of
the grudge I bear you,' sc. oἷός ἐστιν ὁ
ἐμὸς πρὸς σὲ φθόνος (cp. supr. 605 ff.),
or of Hermann, 'When you have shown
the nature of your grudge against me,'
or of the ancient gloss, When you have
first explained:-oh! what a thing envy
is!' are untenable, especially because
they afford no natural explanation of
1. 625. The broken lines (626 foll.)

until the colloquy between Jocasta
and Oedipus has taken place, the short
musical strains which allay the exasperation
of Oedipus and assure him of
his people's loyalty, also relieve the
mind of the spectator from the tension
caused by the preceding dialogue, and
prepare him to give undivided attention
to the central scene-in which the first
doubt is suggested to the mind of Oedipus,
while the impious confidence of

iambic and trochaic rhythms. The 2nd

The other explanation: 'You are dangerous
even when you come to an end of
your wrath' (ὅταν ἐπὶ πέρας ἔλθῃς τῆς

grounds-(1) because presenting a mere
repetition under the form of antithesis;
(2) because θυμοῦ περᾶν, in the sense of
'to pass out of anger,' is too harsh for
Sophocles. Also (3) because some Greek
word is needed to give the sense of

is metaphorical. For περᾶν, ‘to go far,'

irregular construction, -ἔχων (sc. ἦν)
corresponding to εἶχε,-cp. Hdt. 8.
38, μέζονας ἢ κατὰ ἀνθρώπων φύσιν
ἔχοντας. The participle is added,
if φύσιν τίν' εἶχε were τίς ἣν φύσιν;
ἥβη is used not only of early manhood
but of youthful vigour in more advanced
age. Od. 16. 174. For this idea cp.
Aesch. S. c. Τ. 11, 12, καὶ τὸν ἔξηβον

'Though grey
Do something mingle with our younger

A brain that nourishes our nerves,
and can
Get goal for goal of youth.'
ἀκμὴν ἥβης is a courteous expression,
softening the abruptness of the inquiry.
742. The white locks were just beginning
to grow.' χνοάζω is usually applied
to the first appearance of the beard
in youth; here, to the first sprinkling of
grey, as a sign of advancing age. Cp.
Hom. Od. 6. 226, where the sprinkling of
salt on the hair of Ulysses from the sea
spray is called χνοῦς, -ἐκ κεφαλῆς δ᾽ ἔσ-
μηχεν ἁλὸς χνόον ἀτρυγέτοιο. And for
λευκανθές, which is proleptic = ὥστε
λευκανθὲς εἶναι, cp. Hdt. 8. 27, where
λευκανθίζειν is used of men who have
been whitened with chalk.
744. The natural answer of Jocasta is
at the same time an obscure intimation
of the likeness of the father to the son.

seeming to Jocasta to arise simply from

The interpretation of the Scholiast

is equally consistent with of and ὥς γ'.
The latter, however, is nearer to the MSS.,
and equally if not more suited to express
the true meaning. Jocasta implies that
his deserts towards her exceeded those of
common service; thus unconsciously recalling
the peculiar trust she had once
reposed in him. Cp. 1. 1173, and see
Arist. Poet. 1454. The readings ὃ δ'
ἀνήρ, ὅδε γ᾽ ἀνήρ, also point to this: i.e.
(1) ὥσγ', (2) ὅσγ', (3) ὅγ᾽, (4) ὅδ᾽, (5)

met (τριπλῆς, κ.τ.λ.), is extremely natural,
after the general description in
798-799. Oedipus dwells expressly on
each of the circumstances which he
identifies, and it is not likely that he
would omit that which first awakened
his suspicion. Lastly, the omission of
the line produces an asyndeton, which
may be paralleled perhaps from Homer,
but hardly from Attic Greek. To say
that the verse was invented to fill up a
lacuna is an improbable assumption.
The hand (C².), which has supplied
several lines omitted by the first hand of

because he is leading the horses along
the hilly road. After striking him,
Oedipus passes on by the chariot, and
only then comes within the reach of
Laius' goad. It is not clear from the
description whether the herald and the
driver are the same or different. As
there were five in all, and amongst
these were probably the customary δύο
ἀμφίπολοι (one of whom was the οἰκεύς),

were different. And it is improbable

863 foll. As in the first stasimon of
the Oedipus Coloneus, the second of the
Trachiniae, and the first of the Antigone,
the chorus in a pause of the action pour
forth a strain, the interest of which,
though in harmony with feelings suggested
by the dramatic situation, is
almost wholly lyrical. The second antistrophe
returns to the circumstances of
the drama, but in the earlier stanzas the
thought of the impiety of the King and
Queen is lost in the reflections which it
has awakened. This is in so far dramatically
appropriate, as the chorus
could not openly express their censure.
And while a momentary rest is thus
interposed before the chief περιπέτεια,
Ist str. and antistr.
the love of purity and abhorrence of
unholiness which are here expressed
suggest the leading motive' of the
whole tragedy. See Introduction. This
ode is composed of iambic, trochaic,
and dactylic measures, of which the iambic
and dactylic predominate in the
first strophe and antistrophe, and the
trochaic in the second. The stateliness
of the movement in the first strophe and
antistrophe is shown by the prevalence
of the heavy trochee and epitritus
(------), and generally
by the frequency of long syllables.
This effect is, however, lightened in the
fourth and fifth lines by the resolution of
a long syllable in the opening dipodia

2nd stasimon. 'May I never break
the sanctity of the unwritten laws! Heaven-born,
they live and move on high,
and are not made by man, nor shall they
ever sleep or be forgotten. In them is a
Divine power which grows not old.
How dangerous is pride; which heaves
men high and dashes them below, to
depths in which no foot may stir. Not
so the noble ardour for the city's weal,
which may God, who protects me, still
uphold! But may an evil fate overtake
the proud impious one, who tramples
on justice and profanes holy things.
How can he escape from vengeance?
For if actions like his are honourable,
what means my service in the dance?
No longer will I worship unless the
oracles be even now justified in the
sight of men. But, O Zeus, thy power
fails not; let thine eye behold the contempt
which they are pouring on things
Divine. For they heed not the oracles
of Laius, and pay no honour to Apollo.'
863 foll. May I ever keep a holy
purity, in all words and acts for which
there are laws established on high, children
of the sky, of whom Olympus is the
only sire.' The participle φέροντι,
where the infinitive might be expected,
gives the notion of simultaneousness :
;
May my lot be with me in keeping,'
i.e. May it ever be my lot to keep. Cp.
О. С. 648, Thuc. 3. 44, ξυμφέρον
ἔσεσθαι.. προθεῖσι. See E. on L. § 36. p.
63. For ei, which expresses a strong wish,
cp. Eur. Hec. 836, εἴ μοι γένοιτο φθόγγος,
κ.τ.λ. The use occurs in Homer, Il. 24.
74, ἀλλ᾽ εἴ τις καλέσειε θεῶν Θέτιν
ἆσσον ἐμεῖο.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="864">
<p><lem>εὔσεπτον ἁγνείαν</lem>
‘A reverential
purity.' For the exact meaning of the


verbal adj. here, see E. on L. § 53, p. 98.</p>
<p><lem>λόγων ἔργων τε</lem> Genitive of respect.
</p></div>

<div type="commline" n="865">
<p><lem>ὧν</lem>  There is a slight inexactness
of language in the article (τὰν), which
marks the antecedent, being placed (by
a sort of hypallage) with the governing
noun ἁγνείαν, instead of with the genitive
λόγων. This is hardly felt, because
the ideas of the 'purity' and the 'acts
and words' are coextensive.</p>

<p><lem>πρόκεινται</lem> «Have been set forth' or
ordained; the usual word for the promulgation
of a law, e.g. Ant. 36, φόνος πρό-
κειται δημόλευστος. Here almost = εἰσίν.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="866">

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="866-867"><p> 'Created in, and pervading, the
highest heaven, i. e. (1) They are from

ἀθέμιστον· | ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν πάντων νόμιμον

171, αἰθρηγενέος Βορέαο. The accusative
with διά (cp. Aesch. Suppl. 15) is probably
used because the idea is not that
of passing through, but of pervading or
permeating. Their mother-element is
also the sphere of their life. Ether is the
region, Olympus the cause of their birth;
and in contrasting these, Sophocles
follows Homer in making αἰθήρ feminine.
Olympus, the seat of the Gods, is
in Sophocles a sort of unseen Heaven;
and has almost lost the association of
place. Aj. 1389, Ant. 609, O. С. 1655,
Fr. 490.
868. 'Nor was man's mortal nature
operative in their birth.'

a new thought after a previous

κατακοιμάσῃ in L, the absence of the
Doricism in μήν (but cp. θνητή supr.),
and the correspondence of μήποτε in
880, are certainly in favour of μήποτε
which Elmsley introduced, and which
is found in Par. E., though with κατα-

verses, they may be rendered: 'Having
mounted the topmost height she rushes

applied metaphorically to the Spirit of
Necessity in the sense of 'stern,' 'inexorable,'
in Eur. Alc. 982, οὐδέ τις ἀπο-
τόμου λήματός ἐστιν αἰδώς. Here Pride
is imagined falling from her pinnacle on
rugged broken ground, where she is left
helpless to 'stumble on dark mountains.

the loss of one long or two short syllables.

passage is printed as it is written in L.
If we are contented with adopting
θυμοῦ, the meaning will be, <gloss>Who in
such courses can go on to avert the
darts of wrath and ward them from
his soul?</gloss> i. e. What tyrant can avoid
becoming an object of anger? Or, according
to some interpreters, <gloss>Who,
where such things are done, can avoid
being angry?</gloss> But neither meaning is
satisfactory, and the epexegesis, 4. a., is
tame and awkward. ἔρξεται may have
crept in from above. Either here or in
infra 1. 906 there must be some corruption
of the text, as the words θυμοῦ
βέλη have nothing corresponding to
them in the antistrophe, unless the interlinear
gloss παλαιά is supposed to be
a corruption of παλαίφατα, or some such
word. Hermann, in suggesting to omit
ἔρξεται and read θεῶν for θυμῶι (i. e.
θῶμ for θιμῶι), supposing the line φθί-
νοντα γὰρ Λαΐου to be complete, gave an
impossible emphasis to ἀνήρ. <gloss>Who in
such a course is man enough to ward
from his soul the darts of Heaven?</gloss>
Two modifications of this have been
suggested, (1) reading ἀμύνοι for ἀμύ-
νειν (cp. Ant. 635, τίς.. κατάσχοι);
Who, in following such a course, can
continue to ward off the arrows of the
Gods?' (2) Supposing the metre to be
as in the text, with Λαΐου παλαίφατα in
the antistrophe, τίς ἔτι ποτ᾽ ἐν τοῖσδ᾽
ἀνὴρ θυμῷ βάλοι θεῶν βέληψυχᾶς ἀμύνειν;
Who then can imagine how to ward
from his soul the weapons of the Gods?'
The former (1) is preferable.
903.
895-896. For if honour attend such
actions, what need have I to lead the
sacred dance?' If the righteous are as
the wicked,' then, as the Athenians
judged in the time of the plague, it is
ἐν ὁμοίῳ καὶ σέβειν καὶ μή (Thuc. 2. 53).
This thought changes the mood of the
chorus, who for the moment catch the
infection of doubt (as previously they
doubted Teiresias), here as elsewhere
reflecting opposite and conflicting tendencies.
They soon, however, renew
the strain of piety (899, cp. 480), and
appeal to the supreme power of Zeus.
The allusion to their religious function
in the worship of Dionysus is in keeping
with the lyric character of the ode.

911, foll. A way has been prepared
by which the truth shall be revealed
when it seems furthest from the thoughts
of the king and queen. The messenger
who brings from Corinth the welcome
news of the death of Polybus is the
means of unlocking the secret which
the herdsman who has been sent for
would else have buried in silence. Each
knows a part of the mystery, and their
meeting brings the whole to light. Jocasta
still keeps her confidence, but cannot
be unaffected by the mood of Oedipus,
who is shaken by every hint of
fear. She is preparing to supplicate the
gods, not for herself but for her husband
and the state, when the news
arrives, which seems at first to remove
all cause of apprehension.</p>

But Oedipus need not be supposed to

And the same train of thought which

This correction, which
Elmsley made from conjecture, is found
in Flor. Γ. δέ may express the opposition
between the insignificant station
of the ποιμήν and his importance to
Oedipus. The reading of L. and most
MSS. σοῦ γ'.. σωτήρ γε was, however,
approved by Hermann, who quotes
Heindorf on Plat. Euthyd. 277 A. Cp.
also O. C. 387, 977, 1278, 1409.
1031. Oedipus is touched with pity
for his former self. Cp. Shak. Temp.
1. 2, 'Miranda. Alack, for pity ! | I, not
remembering how I cried out then, |
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint, |
That wrings mine eyes to 't.' The question
is suggested to Oedipus by the word
σωτήρ; i. e. ‘From what pain that I
was suffering in my misfortunes did you
rescue me?' but is introduced by the
poet, as the Scholiast properly observes,
in order to lead to the mention of the
personal mark (compare the scar of
Ulysses in the Odyssey) by which the
conviction of the truth is brought home
to Jocasta. In his eagerness to 'delve
to the root' the mystery of his birth,
Oedipus is wholly unconscious of the
effect which the successive answers have
ἀλλὰ ποιμὴν Α.

upon the mind of the queen-the horror
of whose discovery is the chief interest
of this part of the play, and who may
be supposed to remain immoveable until
her outbreak in 1. 1056. The same
explanation applies to 1. 1037, which
adds poignancy to the stroke.

1053. The chorus point to Jocasta,
with what effect on her and the spectator
may be imagined. But they have
as yet no suspicion of the truth. merely
conjecturing that Jocasta must know the
history of the servant of Laius, and that
he who is now over the flock (761) may
have been the shepherd of former time.

Oedipus' uncertainty about the identity

now sending for, and of whom he (the

to be hardly the meaning required
by the context, for the chorus has only
expressed their belief that he is the
same man, and has appealed to Jocasta
to confirm this. A slight alteration, not
altogether without MS. authority, gives
τόνδ' οὗτος λέγει; as in the text.

by the difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory

It was adopted by Porson from the Trin.
MS. and is confirmed by three others
(including Ven. 617 pr.) 'Three entire
seasons of six months extending from
spring to the rising of Arcturus.' It has
been proposed (by E. A. J. Ahrens in
Philologus of 1876) to explain the Laurentian
reading thus: τρεῖς ὅλους
ἐμμήνους χρόνους, 'three full months,
being the time from spring to the rising
of Arcturus:' and it is urged in favour

of this that spring is late in visiting
the Boeotian Highlands. But the awkwardness
of the parenthesis, coming
between the numeral and the noun, and
the unmeaning pleonasm, are fatal objections
to this way of taking the words.
The division of the year κατὰ θέρος καὶ
χειμώνα, into equal periods of six months,
is also more probable. And the imperfect
ἤλαυνον shows that the shepherd is
speaking of what he did not once but
habitually.

The familiar language
of one servant addressing another.
1146. The οἰκέτης knew that he had
been entrusted with the exposure of the
child of Laius, and instead of executing
his commission had given the infant
to a herdsman from Corinth. - He knew
also that Oedipus was the murderer of
Laius-Faithful to Jocasta, he had
hitherto kept both secrets; and this had
occasioned his request to be allowed to
remove as far as possible from the city.
But until this moment the truth has
never flashed upon his mind that the
child of Jocasta and Laius is the husband
of the one and the murderer of the
other. The abruptness of the exclamation
indicates the surprise, which now
breaks upon his mind.

occurs only here in Sophocles, and
in Plato also only once, in the mockheroic

εἶεν, ὦ φέριστε, Well, valiant sir!' The
herdsman has been in the habit of thinking
of Oedipus as the terrible stranger
who had slain Laius, and had subsequently
become the master of his household
as well as ruler of Thebes. A new
horror is now forced upon him; and in
his fear and confusion, being threatened
with immediate violence, he seeks to
soothe Oedipus with flattering terms.
His reserve is intended to contrast with
the familiarity of the other messenger.

But now what woe is like to his;
plunged by reverse of fortune in cruel
misery? O glorious Oedipus! how art
thou sunk into an abyss of infamy, too
long concealed. Time that sees all hath
found thee. And I, unblest in knowing
thee, must weep thy fall. Yet thou wast
he that gave me respite and repose.'
The rhythms of this ode are less elaborate
than those of the three former, and
convey a more direct utterance of feeling.

clear from this, as Schndw. supposed,
that the Scholiast read τὸν σόν. For
he may have taken τὸ σόν substantively

τὸν σόν, although it requires παράδειγμα

for which the phrase τεκνοῦντα καὶ τεκ-
νούμενον is substituted. As infr. 1403 ff.,
the concrete is intended under the abstract
noun. When the marriage is
spoken of, Jocasta is thought of. The
expression is unusual, and yet γεννῶντα
τὸν αὐτὸν γάμον ὃν ἐγεννήθης might be
said even in prose. Cp. supr. 1210.
Otherwise γάμον may be taken as accusative
in regimen, and the participles
either (2) as agreeing with σε
and added in further explanation of
γάμον: 'Condemns the unholy marriage,
condemns thee who art at once
sire and son:' or (3), the participles
agreeing with γάμον, <gloss>Condemns the

still, as far as memory serves me, you
shall learn what befel that unhappy
lady.' The meaning is, You cannot feel
the pain of the event as we did, who
saw what passed.'
In the description which follows, Jocasta
is seen first passing through the
hall or peristyle to the inner chamber,
which she enters and closes the doors
after her. Then in cries which resound
through the hall (while she remains
unseen of any one), she calls the spirit
of Laius to witness the horrors consequent
on their nuptial. The household
would have followed her, but their
attention is arrested by the entrance of
Oedipus: who ranges through the hall
with loud cries, calling for a weapon,
and for the mother-wife. The sound of
his approach precipitates the fatal purpose
of the queen, who hangs herself in
the chamber. Suddenly Oedipus bethinks
him that she is there, and with
a single effort, he bursts open the bolted
doors. He undoes the noose by which she
is hanging, and when she is fallen dead,
he pulls the buckles from her garments
and dashes the points into his eyes.

The Laur.
MS. reads πλεκταῖσ᾽ ἐώραις ἐμπεπληγ-
μένην ὁ δὲ | ὅπωσδ', in which the form
ἐώραις and the meaning of ἐμπεπληγ-
μένην are doubtful, and the second dé in
ὅπως δ' is manifestly wrong. Better
with MM² πλεκταῖσιν αἰώραισιν ἐμπεπ-
λεγμένην, and either ὁ δε omitted, or
the words ὁ δὲ ὅπως δ᾽ ὁρᾷ νιν corrected
into ὁ δ᾽ ὡς ὁρᾷ νιν. The tautology of
πλεκταῖσιν αἰώραισιν ἐμπεπλεγμένην is
not unlike Sophocles (Essay
L. § 44.
p. 83) and ἐμπεπληγμένην, which is the
reading of LE Ven. 617 pr. Vat. 1363,
Vat. be. K., although more expressive of
the violence of the act, 'where she had
been dashed into the noose,' seems hardly
appropriate as a description not of Jocasta
hanging herself, but of the dead
body already hanging. But for ἐμπλήσσω
in this connection, cp. Od. 22. 468 foll.
ὡς δ᾽ ὅταν ἢ κίχλαι τανυσίπτεροι ἠὲ πέ-
λειαι | ἕρκει ἐνιπλήξωσι: and see Hesych.
ἐμπλῆξαι· ἐμπεσεῖν : and for the tense,
11. 16. 660, ἐπεὶ βασιλῆα ἴδον βεβλαμ-
μένον ἦτορ. ὁ δέ, with a pause following
as well as preceding, cp. supr. 1252,
makes a less suitable rhythm than the
'end-stopt' line. The gloss in Trin.

was terrible to see.' Triclinius read γ'.
1268. foll. For when he had plucked
away from her person the clasps of gold
with which her robes were fastened, he
lifted them and smote his eye-balls to the
root, saying aloud, "That they should
not see the evils of which he was the
victim, and the cause, but in darkness
henceforth should look upon those whom
he ought never to have seen, and fail to
know those whom he had desired to
know."' Herm.'s conjecture, ὄψαιντο,
'because they had not seen him,' derives
considerable plausibility (notwithstanding
the doubtfulness of the form) from
ἔπασχεν and ἔδρα. But these imperfects,
as well as ἔδει and ἔχρηζεν, are to be explained
by the implied reference to the
past, when his eyes had seen his father in
the triple way and his mother in Thebes,
whom it would have been better for him
never to have seen, and had failed to recognize
them, whom he had so longed
to know, when the recognition might
have saved all. With sharp pathos he
now says that in the future his eyes
shall not do as in the past. They shall
indeed look on those it were best not
to have seen (his children, the citizens,
his father and mother in Hades, 1371
foll.), but without having sight, and not
know those whom he once desired to
know (with a double reference to his
desire to see his parents and the natural

of κακά having led to the omission of

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1297-1311"><p> The form of the paroemiac
1311 shows that these anapaests
are of the freer kind, which are admitted
in laments, and are thought to have been
sung to Lydian music (Aesch. Persae,
938). Compare lines 983 ff. of the
Trachiniae, where Heracles awakes in
agony, on being brought in. In both
places the rhythm suits a faltering,
interrupted movement. This tends to
justify the scansion of 1303, φευ δυστᾶvõs,
where a pause may be supposed;
and the resolution of the arsis in διαπέ-
ταται in 1310, which is suited to express
α'. 1313-1320=1321-1328.

κέκλιται.) Also the two successive
catalectic verses 1310, 11; cp. El. 86-
89. The commos which follows is arranged
in two strophes and antistrophes,
presenting a highly wrought example of
that alternation of dochmiacs and senarii,
which is often employed in the
μέλη ἀπὸ σκήνης. The dochmiacs express
agitation, to which the senarius
adds a cadence of regret. The Chorus
speak in senarii, except in 1336=1356,
which is iambic dimeter. The long
syllables of the dochmiacs are frequently
resolved. See esp. 11. 1314, 1322, 1340,
1345, 1365. In 1332, 1352, a spondee
is added at the end of the senarius,
giving the effect of a prolonged wailing
note. Cp. 1316, 1324.

The short syllable
of δύστανός, has been thought to
indicate some fault in the text, and the
words may have crept in from 1: 1307:
Lut see the note on the metre on p. 241.
1308. The words φεῦ φεῦ in the MS.
reading interfere with the metre, and
are probably a gloss on alaῖ.
1309, 10. Which way is my voice
dispersed abroad?' The words express
the first bewilderment of one suddenly
blind, hearing his own voice but seeing
no one.
1310 is a paroemiac with a resolution
of the second arsis. Fr. Bellermann conj.

it must have caesura of some kind.

ζῶντε is the

my death in that place, which they
in their life-time appointed for my
destined tomb.' ζώντε is added to
intimate that the intentions which they
had in life will be fulfilled after their
death; κύριον shows that their appointment
was justified by the event
and ratified by fate. The correction
ζῶντι, which Brunck introduced from
the conjecture of Toup, brings in the
notion of a 'living grave' where it
is not required. Ant. 888, ζῶσα τυμ-
βεύειν, is not parallel. ζῶντι would
rather weaken the transition in what

Dindorf's
correction of this line, by substituting
lâ for deí, while retaining τοῦ, is
objectionable on many grounds: (1)
The crasis of da, the third singular indicative
or subjunctive, is not sufficiently
supported in a conjectural reading by
the single instance in Homer, Il. 5. 256,
τρεῖν μ᾽ οὐκ ἐᾷ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη: (2) καιρός
(sc. ἐστιν) is a common idiom, and is
good sense, while οὗ καιρὸς ἐᾷ is neither:
(3) the insertion of the article is a
more likely error than the corruption of
a verb. Meineke's οὗ καιρὸς ή ζην is
better. But the article τοῦ has no special
force, and may have come either from a
gloss or from immediately below; and
the emphatic del suits well with the
feeling of Oedipus, who is thinking of
the unhappy circumstances of his own
life. The pause at the middle of the
line is not frequent. but there are several
examples of such a division, after a strong
monosyllable like ζῆν, in the present play.
See esp. 11. 12, 110, 1066, 1155.

1526. The unintelligible reading of
this line, which appears in most MSS,
†ὅστις οὐ ζήλῳ πολιτῶν καὶ τύχαις
ἐπιβλέπων†, has been changed to ov
τις οὐ ζηλῶν πολιτῶν καὶ τύχαις ἐπι-
βλέπων = · Whom which of the citizens
did not envy, and gaze on his fortunes?'
and to ὃν τις οὐ ζήλῳ πολιτῶν τῆς τύχης
ἐπέβλεπεν; Another solution of the
difficulty is to suppose that a line following
this one has been lost. Who
did not' (after the manner of tyrants)
[maintain his power] 'by envy of the
citizens and by keeping an eye upon
their fortunes; i. e. Oedipus was a wise
and popular ruler, not like Thrasybulus
or Periander, who cut off the tallest
heads of grain. Cp Pind. Pyth. 3. 71,
πραὺς ἀστοῖς, οὐ φθονέων ἀγαθοῖς. But
the transition from the dative to the
participle is harsh; and ζῆλοs is not
φθόνος. The reading of VM, ἐν for
οὐ, and the gloss ἐπαιρόμενοs in ME,
suggest a different line of conjecture, viz.
that some other verb is concealed in
ἐπιβλέπων. ἐπιφλέγων would harmonize
well with κλύδωνα in the following
line, both together suggesting an image
of brightness quenched. Cp. Aesch. S.
c. Τ. 772, τίν᾿ ἀνδρῶν γὰρ τοσόνδ᾽ ἐθαύ-
μασαν θεοὶ καὶ ξυνέστιοι πόλεος, κ τ.λ.:
Ib. 758, κακῶν δ᾽ ὥσπερ θάλασσα κῦμ᾿
ἄγει: Pind. P. 11. 45, δύξ᾽ ἐπιφλέγει.
The Naples MS. No. 291 (II. F. 34),
(quoted by Elmsley as Farn.'), has
τ/ἐπιβλέπων. There still remains the awk-

wardness of ὅστις with the participle.
The emendation above attempted removes
this: but is no doubt only one
of several possible expedients. IP may
have been lost after ἀνήρ (ΗΡΠΡ); and
the remaining letters of πρῶτος, ΟΤΟΣ,
might then be changed to ὅστις; cp.
supr. 478 (ὁτ.-ώστ.), Ο. C. 775 (τισ
τοσ). For ζῆλος πολιτῶν as equivalent
τo εὐδαιμονία, cp. esp. Aj. 503, οίας λα-
τρείας ἀνθ᾽ ὅσου ζήλου τρέφει: Thuc. 2.
64, ὅστις δ᾽ ἐπὶ μεγίστοις τὸ ἐπίφθονον
λαμβάνει, ὀρθῶς βουλεύεται: Pind. 1. 85,

1528. The order is ὥστε (τινα), έπι-
σκοποῦντα ἐκείνην τὴν τελευταίαν ἡμέ-
ραν ἰδεῖν, ὀλβίζειν μηδένα ὄντα θνητόν.
So that one waits to see that final day,
not calling any mortal happy, before he
have completed the term of his life,
without any sorrow.' Cp Pind. Nem.
ΙΙ. 10, τέλος δωδεκάμηνον περάσαι σὺν
ἀτρώτῳ κραδίᾳ. The lighter trochaic
rhythm, here (1515 foll.) preparing for
and hastening the exit of the chief
actor, affords relief to the mind of the
spectator after the long strain of excited
feeling. The comparative tameness of
the concluding lines (wrongly assigned
to Oed. by the Schol., who was thinking
of the Phoenissae) is in accordance with
this. The lines in the Phoenissae read
like an imitation of this passage, which,
although beneath the general style of
Sophocles, is not inferior in merit to the
concluding words of the chorus in the
other plays.

In the Oedipus Tyrannus the action of Greek Tragedy attained its
most perfect concentration and unity. In the Antigone and Electra
the approach to this is very strongly marked: in the Ajax and Trachiniae
less strongly. These five excel all other tragedies in severity.
They represent a type of dramatic art that is peculiar to Sophocles.
In each of them he has selected a supreme moment which he has
treated with an exclusive intensity. The great dramas of Aeschylus,
whether they were represented in connected trilogies or not, are
fragmentary when taken singly, and their parts are less highly
finished: while in the richly varied theatre of Euripides the attention
is seldom so enchained by the principal action of any piece as not

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
to allow room for minor distractions; for subsidiary situations, and
general reflections on life. Such works as the Antigone and Oedipus
Tyrannus were perhaps only possible in the age of Pericles, and the
immediately succeeding years. The political and social changes of
the next generation led inevitably to an alteration in the tone of
Tragedy.
The Philoctetes and the Oedipus Coloneus, which are affirmed
by constant tradition to have been amongst the latest works of Sophocles,
have certainly some common features in which they differ from
his other extant plays, and they have less of this severe and concentrated
character.
1. They dwell more on the external means of producing pity
and fear, and appeal more obviously to the senses of sight and
hearing. In modern language, they are more melodramatic, and
less tragical. The entrance of the chief person in each following
that of the chorus produces a striking visual impression¹. The lameness
and neglected aspect of Philoctetes, the blindness, the soiled
raiment, and the beggar's scrip of Oedipus, are kept vividly prominent
throughout. The withdrawal of Oedipus from the sacred ground,
his hiding in the grove, the threatening movements of the chorus,
the intercession of Antigone, her subsequent capture on the stage, the
attempt of Creon in person to drag Oedipus away by force, the blind
man's gestures when his daughters are restored (1099 ff.), the clinging
of the sisters to Polynices, and afterwards to their father (1544), are
spectacular incidents with which may be compared the kneeling of
Philoctetes (1. 485), the evident signs of his agony when overcome by
pain, his falling asleep upon the stage, and the passage between the
chorus and Neoptolemus which follows; all the incidents in which
the bow is conspicuous; above all, the tableau, where Philoctetes aims
the shaft at Odysseus, and Neoptolemus arrests his arm; the struggle
of Philoctetes with the attendants of Odysseus, who prevent him from
committing suicide, and the last contention between Neoptolemus and
Odysseus, in which both draw their swords, or are about to do so. In
all these cases there is a direct and pointed appeal to the eye.
The inarticulate cries of Philoctetes, which are heard before his
entrance, and again afterwards on the stage, may be compared with
the wild outcry of the chorus at the name of Oedipus, and their loud
summons to Theseus upon the attempt of Creon. The lyrical peculiarities
of both dramas arise partly from the attempt to produce a
thrilling effect at once on eye and ear. Phil. 201-18, 827-64, О. С.
117-253, are unlike anything elsewhere in Sophocles, and can be
paralleled only from Euripides. See especially Orestes, 140-207.
In speaking of the external machinery of these dramas, we must
not forget the thunder and lightning, and the effect of supernatural
darkness, which accompany the peripeteia of the Oedipus Coloneus,
nor the apparition of Heracles, which brings about the catastrophe
1 Cp. Phil. 225, καὶ μή μ᾿ ὄκνῳ | δεί-

οπτον εἰσορῶν ἀτιμάσῃς.

of the Philoctetes, although in this last we may recognize a return to
the earlier manner of the Ajax.
Lastly, both dramas have their appropriate setting of picturesque
natural scenery: the uninhabited promontory, with its rocks, woods,
springs, wild beasts and birds; the surpassing beauties of Colonus.
Although no drama of Sophocles is without allusions to external
nature, the tents on the damp, green Troad, amidst the bleating
of the flocks, contrasted with bright, rocky Salamis (Aj.), the brook
of Dirke reflecting the sunrise, the bare rising ground above the
orchards (Ant.), the vale of Argolis (El.), the wild pastures of
Citheron, the thicket by the triple way (O. T.), the high wold of
Oeta, the Cenean promontory, the warm springs of Thermopylae, the
Artemis-haunted Sperchean shore (Trach.), -yet in none of them are
the features of the outward scene so prominent, or so continually
dwelt upon, as in these two. The Trachiniae, which comes nearest
to the last plays in this and other respects, may be regarded as intermediate
between them and the central group, Antigone, Electra,
Oedipus Tyrannus.
2. Also in other ways the Oedipus Coloneus shows a relaxation
of the Sophoclean severity. The action of the Oedipus
Tyrannus yields no place to subordinate interests. The public
calamities of which we hear at the beginning only bring the person
of the hero into a clearer light, and are lost sight of in the consummation
of his fate. But in the Oedipus Coloneus the destiny of
Oedipus, although the central, ever-present object, is by no means
the sole constituent element. The religio loci of Colonus, the glory
of Athens, the enmity of Thebes, are also largely present. All these
are woven, in subordination to the principal motive, into an artistic
whole; but the unity which results is of a different order from the
unity of the Oedipus Tyrannus or the Antigone. The interest of the
Ajax was doubtless largely reinforced by national pride ¹. The hero
of Aegina and Salamis was associated with glorious memories, and
every Athenian was interested in the vindication of his heroic virtue.
But the epithet κλεινή attached to Salamis, and the single mention of
Athens by the hero in his last speech, are the only direct indications
of this feeling. For parallels to this aspect of the Oedipus Coloneus
we must again have recourse to Euripides². The subject of the
Philoctetes is not national, although Neoptolemus, like Ajax, is an
Aeacid: but a cognate element of subordinate interest may be found
in the allusions to persons and events at Troy. (Phil. 410-460.)
3. The differences here pointed out may be partly accounted for
by the fact that the Philoctetes and Oedipus Coloneus are not
tragedies ending in a disaster, but dramas of reconciliation, in which
there is a change from evil to good fortune, a long struggle of some
kind being presupposed. Such dramas are necessarily episodical,
because the fable does not of itself supply a natural culmination of

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
dramatic interest ¹. The central motive, being of a feebler kind, is
more apt to be reinforced from without. And some of the preceding
remarks might be applied to the Eumenides of Aeschylus, in which
the fate of the hero is bound up with the religio loci and with the
pride of Athens in her Areopagus. It is true also that the general
theme of the final vindication of a noble spirit has been anticipated in
the concluding portion of the Ajax. But the Eumenides was probably
one of a trilogy, and in any case amongst the last plays of
Aeschylus: and the peculiarities in question are not found in the
Ajax. The fact that they are found in the Oedipus Coloneus and
Philoctetes, as in no other of the seven plays, gives probability to the
tradition which assigns them to a distinct period.
4. And this probability is greatly strengthened when it is further
observed that in these two plays a certain meditative inwardness
begins to take the place of dramatic energy. The intensity of the
action in the Oedipus Tyrannus, while dispensing with external adjuncts,
also leaves less room for quiet contemplation. The emotions
that are aroused are not unaccompanied with deep thoughts: but these
are flashed upon the mind, not brooded over. Whereas the spectator
who had before him the blind Oedipus, or the lame Philoctetes,
through five long scenes, had time to think about the hero's wrongs, and
to reflect on the ethical and religious aspects of the situation. While
the catastrophe of both dramas is produced by external means, (the
'dreadful summoner' in the Oedipus Coloneus, the apparition of Heracles
in the Philoctetes), - and not developed from the action itself, as
in the Antigone, Electra, and Oedipus Tyrannus, -the real peripeteia
or culmination of interest in both is of an inward nature, turning
upon mental conditions. There is abundance of sustained interest, but
that which keeps the spectator in suspense is not the imminence of
some fatal act or discovery, but the resolution of such questions as
these, Will the Coloniatae, will Theseus, acknowledge the essential
innocence of Oedipus notwithstanding his reputed crimes: will they
prove their nobility by protecting him, and having once undertaken
his defence, will they continue true? We know that on this depends
at once the final peace of Oedipus and the glory of Athens: but
the problem has an interest apart from consequences. Again, will
ambition or faithfulness win the final mastery in the breast of
Neoptolemus? This inward problem divides our interest with the
contemplation of the obdurate resentment of the frank-hearted Philoctetes.
Both together throw into the shade the more practical question,
which the θεὸς ἀπὸ μηχανῆς comes in to solve, Will Philoctetes return to
Troy?
This contemplative tendency may be regarded as indicative of
Sophocles' later manner for two chief reasons, both as coincident with
the growth of ethical reflection at Athens towards the end of the fifth
century в. с., і. e. during the last decade of the life of Socrates, and as
evincing that εὐκολία, or mellowness of spirit, which the poet's contemporaries
observed especially in his later years.

INTRODUCTION.

5. And here there occurs a remarkable parallel between the most
perfect of ancient and the greatest of modern tragic poets. The words
in which a recent writer has characterized the last group of Shakspeare's
dramas might be applied with little modification to the
Oedipus Coloneus. 'From the tragic passion which reached its
climax' (shall we say in the Oedipus Tyrannus?) 'we pass suddenly
to beauty and serenity: from the plays concerned with the violent
breaking of human bonds, to a group of plays which are all concerned
with the knitting together of human bonds, the reunion of
parted kindred,' - ' the atonement for wrong.'-' In these plays there
are two sets of dramatis personae: the great sufferers, aged and experienced,'-'and
the young and beautiful children in the brightness
of the morning of life.'-' There is a romantic element about these
plays. In all there is the same romantic element of lost children recovered
by those to whom they are dear.'-' In all there is a beautiful
romantic background of sea or mountain' (of grove or island) 1.
The same writer reminds us that the Tempest has been supposed to
reflect Shakspeare's personal feeling: just as in parts of the Oedipus
Coloneus the poet gives indirect expression to his love of home,
and to his consciousness of the burden of age (ll. 62, 3, 668 ff.,
1556 ff.).
The only important words omitted in the foregoing extract have
reference to the forgiveness of injuries. This Christian grace is wholly
absent both from Oedipus and Philoctetes. They are as great in their
resentment as in their wrongs. Oedipus is reconciled to the Erinyes:
he has peace with the gods, and goodwill for the Athenian 'men of goodwill,'
but like Ajax he is inexorable towards his persecutors, and leaves
a curse behind him as well as a blessing.
It is this darker side of the Oedipus Coloneus that has often suggested
another Shakspearian parallel, that of King Lear. And certainly
there is no personage in Shakspeare whom the aged Oedipus more
nearly resembles. He has the same consciousness of being 'more
sinned against than sinning:' the same fond clinging to parental and
kingly honours: the same calamity in being driven from home and
kindred by his offspring: the same vehemence in cursing them; and
he finds in Antigone the same comfort which Lear finds in Cordelia.
But he has more true dignity than Lear ever had, and he knows well
throughout the differing qualities of his children. He is assured that
the hard life which his daughters have lived has been compensated
by his affection for them.
6. Even when descending occasionally from the summit of tragedy,
and expatiating in milder regions, Sophocles still remains the supreme
artist. The Coloneus is different in kind from the Tyrannus, but it
is not less wonderful. The author of the first Greek argument is
perfectly justified in saying: τὸ δὲ δρᾶμα τῶν θαυμαστῶν.
From first to last the mind dwells with unbroken sympathy on the
person of Oedipus, who from the moment when he appears to the
chorus never leaves the stage, until the time arrives for his mysterious

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
departure. And when he is no more seen, attention is still riveted on
him by the solemn description of his passing away.
This central interest is enhanced by various shades of contrast, in
which this drama is unusually rich, some of the gradations being peculiarly
soft and gentle. Old age and childhood, religion and superstition,
horror and pity, royal courtesy and royal sorrow, peace and
contention, the blessing and the curse, all pass before us in impressive
harmony.
We see the effect produced by the person of Oedipus on an ordinary
Athenian, and again on the rustic villagers, who shudder when
they hear his name: we see them calmed and partly reconciled by
the fearless affectionate pleading of the girl Antigone. The arrival of
Ismene, while furthering the action, presents us with a minor contrast
between the sisters, both faithful, one heroic in her faithfulness. The
princely nobleness of Theseus gives assurance of peace and victory,
and the praises of Colonus are sung. The contention with Creon,
whom we are made to hate, and the curse on Polynices, whom we pity
while condemning him, only delay the rest which they cannot destroy.
The gloom attending the departure of Polynices, and the contrast between
the acceptance of Oedipus and the rejection of one who 'found
no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully,' makes a profoundly
solemn impression on the mind of the chorus. Yet we foresee
that even the doom of Polynices will be ultimately softened by
the far-reaching affection of Antigone. The 'natural tears' of the two
children do not break the tranquil spell for the Athenian spectator,-in
whose land 'the kindness of the dead' has been laid up for evermore¹.
THE PLOT (ἡ σύστασις τῶν πραγμάτων).
Oedipus had not long remained in Thebes after the day of horror.
Creon, who had hesitated to cast him forth when he himself desired
it, had afterwards yielded to the solicitation of the citizens, who were
bent on 'driving out the pollution.' The sons made no resistance, and
the blind and feeble king was forced to wander forth alone. After a time,
Antigone, as she grewolder and felt the first motions of her heroic nature,
1 The fact mentioned in the second ὑπό-
θεσις, that the Oedipus Coloneus was exhibited
by the younger Sophocles in the
archonship of Micon, four years after the
author's death, may be accepted as being
probably taken from the διδασκαλίαι, without
admitting the assumption that it was
then produced for the first time. But the
opinion, that the drama was written in old
age, seems to have been universally received
in antiquity. (Cic. de Senectute,
c. 7; Plutarch de Rep. ab Sene gerenda,
p. 785 a.) And although the story 'that
Sophocles, when accused of dotage by his
sons, convinced his judges by reading the
first stasimon of this play, which he was
then composing,' is almost certainly apocryphal
(notwithstanding Ar. Rhet. 3. 15),
and as Hermann (1841) has shown, is
probably based on a fancy of Aristophanes',
yet it is traced to the first century
B.C., and presupposes the general
belief that this drama was a late work
of Sophocles. But even were this story
credited, and the statement of the second
ὑπόθεσις accepted without reserve, it would
not be necessary to believe that this immortal
work was composed at the age of
90. Political causes may have delayed its
appearance. See below, p. 275.

followed her father into the wilds, and led him up and down to beg a
scanty subsistence from village to village. Once only they had a
visit from Ismene, who came secretly to tell them of an oracle which
the Thebans had received, affecting her father's destiny. Thus time
elapsed, and Oedipus was now wayworn and old, when led by knowledge
of the oracles, and also drawn by some mysterious guidance, he
came into the plain of Attica. (εἴσοδος) -At this moment he appears
on the stage. He is changed alike from the pride of his former
power, and from the fury of his despair. He is dignified by the consciousness
of a grief unlike other men, and of a sacred mission. As
a sign of their approaching some city, they have met several wayfarers,
and each one has told them that they are drawing near to Athens.
At last Oedipus, still prompted by the inward monitor, desires to rest,
('by some sacred precinct if so be'), and the next person who comes
near (an Athenian from the neighbourhood) informs him that he
is violating the sacred ground of the Eumenides. He accepts the
omen. In the oracle which had first pointed to his calamities, it had
been contained that he should end his life in such a spot, and in doing
so, bless the country that received him and be revenged upon his
enemies. From this moment he is fully conscious of the Divine
favour, and waits patiently, though not without anxiety, for the miraculous
consummation. His peace is assured, but not yet attained.
He has no fear of the Erinyes: they have done their worst, and are
now really to him the 'kind goddesses,' 'sweet daughters of old Night'
(1. 106). He knows that they will receive him, and not cast him out.
This means, not merely that he is longing for the repose of death;
but that by an inward enlightenment, following upon his sufferings,
his noble nature is purified and calmed, and he looks onwards with a
good hope that is yet full of awe (1-110).
(πάροδος καὶ μέλη ἀπὸ σκηνῆς-ῥήσεις)-But his knowledge is not
shared by the rustic guardians of the sacred grove, in whose persons
the narrowness of local superstition is contrasted with the larger
spirit of piety which the poet upholds. These men are summoned
by the informant of Oedipus, who, at their request, bears the news
to Theseus. They insist on all minutest ceremonies of the shrine
of which they are the protectors, but know little of the inward
meaning of any of them. They are filled with horror at the idea
of one having encroached upon their holy place, and they shrink
at the very sight of the offender. But when they see that he is
ragged, old, and blind, though their wonder is even more excited,
they begin to pity him, until, in reply to their interrogations, he
gives his name. The unhappy Oedipus, indeed! Nay, rather, to
their apprehension, the polluted wretch, whose presence within their
borders is sure to bring calamity. Antigone appeals to them to
show mercy to the unfortunate; and Oedipus tells them that they
are mistaken, if in rejecting the suppliant they think to do honour
to the Gods. The guardians of the ground, though superstitious, are
not inhumane; and they are impressed by the solemn words of the
old stranger. When he declares that he is come to bless Athens,
they are so far pacified as to wait until Theseus, who has taken the

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
scattered villages under his supreme authority (cp. Thuc. 2. 15), has
been sent for to resolve the doubt (111-302).
(First ἐπεισόδιον) - Ismene comes, and reports the impending struggle
between the brothers at Thebes, adding that Creon is on his
way with a commission to take Oedipus home, since Phoebus has
declared that victory will be with those who have him on their side.
But though the Thebans desire to get him into their power, yet because
of his past calamities they will not receive him, nor give him
burial in their land.
Oedipus is thus confirmed in his presage, and in his resolution to
remain at Colonus. He pronounces the curse upon his sons, and
declares more openly than before that his advent is a blessing to
Athens and a calamity to Thebes (313-460).
The chorus, on whom this scene has made some impression,
although their scruples are by no means overcome, advise Oedipus
to make atonement at the shrine of the Erinyes, with the usual ceremonies,
which they carefully describe. Ismene goes to perform these:
and, in the interval that still remains before the coming of Theseus,
Oedipus answers the importunate questions of the chorus by again
pleading the unconsciousness and therefore the innocence of his past
actions (κομμός) (461-548).
(Second ἐπεισόδιον)-Theseus arrives, and in a few gracious words
expresses the true sympathy of one who has had experience of
adversity. Oedipus does not disdain this courtesy of a princely nature,
but, instead of asking for assistance, gives himself to Athens. The day
is coming when all will not go so smoothly between Athens and Thebes,
and when the grave of Oedipus will be the pledge of victory. He only
claims protection from the attempt of Creon. Theseus accepts the
boon with the same noble confidence with which he had at first offered
help, and in modest words assures Oedipus of his protection (549-
647).
(First στάσιμον) - The peacefulness of the situation is for the present
restored, and the chorus at last give the Stranger an unreserved welcome
to Colonus and Athens, exalting in their song the beauties of
their rural district and the divine privileges which are there treasured
for the great city (668-719).
(Third ἐπεισόδιον) -The arrival of Creon again disturbs the tranquillity
of the scene. Although he has already intercepted Ismene when
about her offering, he at first affects to use persuasion, and would
make it appear that Oedipus is perverse in refusing to return home.
This draws a torrent of invective from the old man, who exposes the
duplicity of the Thebans. (κομματικά) - After some altercation, Creon
avows the capture of Ismene, and, resorting to open violence, gives a
sign to his attendants, who carry off Antigone. He is himself laying
hands on the person of Oedipus, when the shouting of the inhabitants
brings Theseus to the spot (720-886).
The prince had not gone far, but with a religious feeling apparently
prompted by the Stranger's advent, had been sacrificing at the neighbouring
altar of Poseidon. He sends word to those attending
the sacrifice, to set out instantly in pursuit of the servants of Creon,
<pb n="263"/>

who were carrying off the maidens, and indignantly expostulates with
Creon for the violence of his acts. Creon asserts, in his defence, that
he was provoked by the bitter words of Oedipus, and adds with a
sneer, that he had not thought the great Athens, whose court of
Areopagus had 'purged the gentle weal,' would have given protection
to an incestuous parricide. To this Oedipus replies in a passionate
outburst, in which much of his early impetuosity is recalled, that his
crimes were involuntary, and that he is innocent. In order to make
his innocence appear complete, the murder of his father, which in the
Oedipus Tyrannus is represented as perpetrated in anger, is here
spoken of as having been done in self-defence. Theseus, who loves
deeds more than words, simply bids Creon lead to where the maidens
are (887-1043).
(Second στάσιμον) -Oedipus is now left alone upon the stage, and
the chorus console him with an imaginary description of the victorious
pursuit and rescue of the captive maidens (1044-1095).
(Fourth ἐπεισόδιον) - No sooner is the strain ended than, to the joy of
Oedipus, Theseus returns with Antigone and Ismene.
But the father's gratitude is immediately put to a severe test.
Theseus has been told that there is a suppliant at the altar of
Poseidon: and by the description given of him, Oedipus knows the
suppliant to be Polynices.
He reluctantly yields to the petition of Theseus and Antigone,
that the son may be allowed to speak with his father.
On this Theseus goes forth, and the chorus (in the third στάσιμον)
mourn over the incessant vexations to which the old age of Oedipus
is exposed (1096-1248).
(Fifth ἐπεισόδιον) -Polynices comes and begs with tears that his
father would cease from his anger against him, and take his part. But
Oedipus, who had refused to strengthen the Theban side, is no less obdurate
to the prayer of his eldest son, and calls the justice of Heaven
to witness the curses he invokes on both his sons alike for their
unfilial conduct. Antigone tenderly beseeches her brother to desist
from his fatal attempt: but he goes onward to his doom, and
only asks for her kind offices in his burial. (Compare the Antigone.)
(1249-1446.)
The hour is now come. The destiny of Oedipus is full. The
promised sign of thunder is heard; the scene is darkened; the storm
rages. (κομματικά) -Theseus is again summoned, and when he arrives,
Oedipus renews his solemn promise, and bids the king follow, while
he himself leads the way, no longer taking the hand of any one, to his
last resting-place (1447-1555).
(Fourth στάσιμον ἀγγελου ῥῆσις) -The chorus send after him a
few words of prayer: and soon one of the attendants returns and
makes an impressive report of the marvellous but peaceful end (1556-
1666).
(κομμός, ἔξοδος) -The passionate lament of the daughters, who ask
in vain to see their father's grave, is soothed by Theseus on his
return. He promises to send them home to Thebes, and the drama
closes (1667-1779).

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
Of the main situation in the Oedipus Coloneus there is no clear trace
in the earlier literature, except the lines quoted at the beginning of this
Introduction from the Phoenissae of Euripides. Unless we set aside
the received date of either play, and assume an imitation of the elder
by the younger poet here as in Phoen. 1758 ff., the grave of Oedipus
must have been the subject of a legend known to them both, in which
the blind hero was led to Colonus by Antigone in consequence of an
oracle. If Euripides followed the traditional story, as in such an
incidental allusion is most likely, Sophocles has here, as elsewhere,
deepened his composition by interposing an indefinite time, viz. between
Oedipus' departure from Thebes and his arrival in Attica. So
in the Oedipus Tyrannus, whereas others had supposed the discovery
to take place in the very year of the fatal union with Jocasta',
Sophocles (or Aeschylus before him) imagines a long interval of
prosperity 2; and in the Trachiniae he puts many years between the
marriage of Heracles to Deianira and his death, which others had
described as following immediately on that events. In the present
instance his invention of a long period of wandering, during which
Oedipus and Creon had become old men, was favoured by the many
monuments of Oedipus that were associated with the cultus of the
Eumenides or of Demeter in various parts of the borderland between
Boeotia and Attica, in all of which Oedipus may be imagined to have
sojourned from time to time.
While bringing on the stage a new fable, Sophocles by no means
parts company with tradition: and in all that relates to the attempt
of Polynices and Adrastus, and the curse of Oedipus, he probably
had in his mind the Thebais of Arctinus, the Oedipodea of Cinaethon,
and other popular authorities, from which he selected what he
found suitable, altering where he chose, and rigorously rejecting
all that he found irrelevant. But the Cyclic poetry has perished,
and we are only able to distinguish two particulars in which he has
recast the heroic legend.
Polynices, whom Euripides, apparently in accordance with the
common tradition, represents as the younger brother, is here made
the elder. This has the double effect of making the usurpation of
Eteocles less excusable, and so increasing the guilt of the Theban
party, and of heightening the interest of the spectators in Polynices,
who, whatever his previous conduct may have been, has now been
wronged. It may also be observed that the curse of Oedipus is more
impressive when uttered upon his firstborn son, who, however pitiable
now, was originally most bound to protect his father.
1 Od. 11. 274, γῆμεν· ἄφαρ δ᾽ ἀνά-
πυστα θεοὶ θέσαν. Oedipus was commonly
said to have died at Thebes, as in
11. 23. 679, δεδουπότος Οἰδιπόδαο.

3 Schndw., Introd. to Trachiniae.
K. O. Müller on Aesch. Eum. §§ 81-
3. Schndw., Die Sage von Ödipus.
The intention attributed to the Thebans
in l. 404 was similarly favoured by the
legend mentioned by the Schol. on 1. 91.
The lines in which Polynices describes
his comrades have a distinctly Epic tone.
7
This is confirmed by the remark of the
Scholiast, who on such a point is especially
trustworthy: τὸ χ παράκειται, ὅτι πρεσ-
βύτερον φησὶ τὸν Πολυνείκη. Schol. 1.375.
Polynices is the one who provokes the
curse in the passage from a Thebais quoted
by Athenaeus, 11, 465 F.
<pb n="265"/>
INTRODUCTION.
269
The other change is in the place given to the curse of Oedipus,
which, though still in part referrible to the irascibility of age, is more
immediately connected with the unfilial behaviour of his sons, and
with the Divine Nemesis, which is denounced against the whole people
of Thebes, for having unrighteously condemned the guiltless. Besides
this ethical motive there is a dramatic reason for bringing Polynices
before his father at the last. The horror which the scene leaves on
the spectator prepares him to be rightly impressed by what succeeds.
The peal of thunder following so soon upon the curse must have made
the flesh creep. And the description of the calm end of Oedipus
coming after this must have brought with it a sense of consolation
mingled with awe. It is curious that the poet in so far returns to the
original story as to represent the curses which he puts into the mouth
of Oedipus as repetitions of a curse which had been pronounced by
him at an earlier time (1. 1375).
THE PERSONS (τὰ ἤθη).
There is considerable variety of character in the Oedipus Coloneus:
and although there is comparatively little action, each of the persons
lives and breathes as a real human being. We enter perfectly into the
situation and motives of each individually, while they affect us also in
their relations to the central figure. There are some subtle traits; such
as the mingled tact and boldness of the child Antigone in interceding
with the elders for her father, and with her father for Polynices;
the degree of querulousness, not amounting to any loss of
dignity, that marks the old age of Oedipus; the natural pity that
tempers the fanaticism of the chorus; also the contrast between their
sacred horror, and the matter-of-fact piety of the ξένος. The character
of Theseus is that of a true prince, generous and considerate to the
unfortunate, irresistibly commanding, by the force of simple justice, to
his subjects and his enemies. His noble love of action in preference
to words assists the progress of the drama at the points where it
is most in danger of flagging. The person of Oedipus is at once
profoundly sacred and intensely human. The deep solemnity that
breathes throughout the play arises greatly from his consciousness
of a destiny unlike that of other men. Yet the poet does not shrink
from representing in him the feebleness and caution of old age (113
ff., 174 ff.), together with an irascible spirit in which the impetuosity
of the first Oedipus is still perceptible (761 ff. etc.). His royal dignity
peers through his discoloured raiment (75,6). He bears with him.
a softened memory of his misfortunes (1130 ff.). But above all, his
affection for his daughters shines forth most brightly when he is about
to leave them (1610 ff.). This union of tenderness with vindictiveness,
of which Electra is also a signal example, belongs essentially to
the sentiment of the ancient world. Lastly, it is remarkable that while
Polynices is utterly condemned, his person engages the interest of the
spectator, and does not forfeit the sympathy of the poet, who, like
Dante, can feel tenderly without softening judgment.

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
THE STYLE (λέξις).
The language of the Oedipus Coloneus is distinguished, (1) by an
ornate fulness and expansiveness, and also (2) by extreme reflectiveness
and refinement. The latter remark (2) applies chiefly to the lyrical
portions, which are separated in style from the iambic ῥήσεις more
than elsewhere in Sophocles, the dialogue in the more level passages
being characterized by the same vernacular ease as in the Philoctetes.
See esp. 11. 720-760, 896-959. But what is true in this respect
of the lyric measures is still applicable, though in a less degree, to
the senarii.
(a.) We observe especially the frequency of compound words for
simple: e.g. l. 17, πυκνόπτεροι, (where the Scholiast observes ἐκράτησε
δὲ μεγάλως τῇ φράσει, ὥστε μέλισσαν αὐτὸν ἐκάλεσαν οἱ κωμικοί), 57, χαλκό-
πους, 482, μελάμφυλλος little more than μέλαινα, 540, ταλακάρδιος =
τάλας, 900, δίστομος, 1055, δίστολος, 1081, ταχύρρωστος.
(6.) The rarer or less obvious expression is constantly preferred :
1. 139, τὸ φατιζόμενον, ΙΟΙ, ἀσκέπαρνος = ἄξεστος, 150, 1, ἀλαῶν ὀμμάτων . .
φυτάλμιος, 25, ἔμπορος = ὁδοίπορος, 482, μελίσσης = μέλιτος, 248, νεύσατε,
550, ὄμφην (1348, ὄμφης), 691, στερνούχου, 717, ἐκατομπόδων, 884, γᾶς
πρόμοι, 1055, ἐγρεμάχαν, 1062, ῥιμφαρμάτοις . . ἁμίλλαις, 1092, ὀπαδόν,
1156, ἔμπολιν, 1212, σκαιοσύναν φυλάσσων, 1220, ἰσοτέλεστος, 1235,
ἐπιλέλογχε, 1243, κυματοαγεῖς, 1260, ὀμματοστερεῖ, 1477, διαπρύσιος, 1495,
ἑστίαν ἁγίζων, (for θύων ἐπὶ βωμῷ), 1655, πυμάτῳ (also 1235), 1762, ξυνά.
The tendency to periphrasis and the use of Epic Greek may be
recognized in several of the above instances. The love of amplification
appears also in ornamental epithets and twofold expressions
such as μήθ' οὗ κέκευθε μήτ᾽ ἐν οἷς κεῖται τόποις (1522).
The poet's peculiarities have become more pronounced, and also
the ultra-refinement of the period has influenced the diction,-without,
however, injuring its beauty.
(c) In like manner, the influence of the Sophistic tendency is perceptible
in many of the ῥήσεις. A modern reader is apt to feel that the
contentions between Oedipus and Creon and the scenes with Polynices
are too long, and that this takes something from the main impression.
As in the latter part of the Ajax, there is a rhetorical prolixity that
seems to us inconsistent with ideal poetry. But while Sophocles at his
highest and best subdues this tendency into just conformity with his
tragic motive, it is everywhere present in him, and the indulgence of
it must have been extremely popular. As in the word-contest of
Teucer and Menelaus the Athenians saw an image of the debates
in the ecclesia, so in the pleadings of Oedipus they would find an
echo of the forensic oratory, and of the ethical disputations of which
they had now grown fond. The ἀδολεσχία of the period is reflected
here 1.
The prevailing metre of the lyrical portion is logaoedic, -chiefly
1 Γνώμαι occur at 11. 115, 171, 185,
229, 246, 277, 309, 339, 488, 508, 548,
607, 613, 658, 755, 776, 954, 1032,
1116, 1135, 1187, 1192, 1197, 1201,
1212 ff., 1267, 1281, 1381, 1451, 1484,
1534, 1536, 1565, 1615, 1697, 1751.
Many of these moral sayings are put into
the mouths of the two children.

glyconic. The structure of the four stasima is extremely regular. (In
the second the glyconics are mixed with trochees and in the third with
iambi. The second strophe and antistrophe of the first stasimon are
choriambic.) At the same time, both in the stasima, and still more in the
μέλη ἀπὸ σκηνῆς, the metre is studiously varied, above all in the remarkable
'commatic parodos,' where it is to be observed that the anapaests
which accompany changes of position are of the freer kind. The
changes of rhythm in 212 foll. are especially noticeable. The dactyloiambic
movement which ends this passage, ll. 228-254, is recalled
in the opening of the final commos, ll. 1674-6, 1700-2, which as it proceeds,
however, becomes chiefly iambic. There are many places in which
the reading has been questioned on the ground of metre, and it is
sometimes hard to decide between the possibility of corruption and
that of experiments in rhythm. In particular it admits of discussion
whether in this play and the Philoctetes Sophocles allows 'polyschematism'
in logaoedic lines, as Euripides has occasionally done, and
also whether in some places the correspondence of long (or 'irrational')
syllables to short ones may not be justified by a retardation of rhythm
such as may be clearly traced in the iambic trimeters of the commos
in O. T. 1312-1366. See the note* on p. 241. This may be assumed
with more confidence with respect to dochmiacs than to glyconics,
as recitative (παρακαταλογή) admits of more licence than choral song.
See notes on 11. 198, 522, 1069, 1560, 1561, 1568, 1570.
The senarii of the dialogue have an easy and regular flow, rising in
some places to a grandeur which recalls the Oedipus Tyrannus, (see
esp. 11. 969-99, 1360-96), but for the most part running on with an
even tenour, not swelling into waves. There is an increase in the
variety of pauses and the number of 'light endings,' though this is less
marked than in the Philoctetes, and a corresponding increase in the
number of lines that are divided between different persons¹. The
rhythm of ll. 1169, 1414, is unlike anything elsewhere in Sophocles, and
the division of the trisyllabic foot in ll. 26, 823, 1008, is noticeable.
1 In Aj. 591-5, 981-6, such division
occurs only at the caesura, and except in
986 at the penthemimeral caesura. In the
Electra there is an increase in the number
of such lines, and the hepthemimeral division
is more frequent. One line is thus

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
THE SENTIMENT (διάνοια).
1. Religious and moral. It is perceived at once that the Oedipus
Coloneus is full of religious feeling; and in this we may distinguish
two pervading elements, which, though for a moment they seem to
jar, are held in harmonious combination by the poet's skill-the
religio loci, and the inward religious sentiment of peace.
There breathes throughout the most affectionate reverence for
Colonus; for the numen of Poseidon, who inhabits there, of Prometheus,
of the Erinyes; for the mystery of the brazen threshold, the
groves of the Academy, the neighbouring hill of Demeter; together with
a proud and tender fondness for the natural beauties of the region.
All these, however, with their manifold associations, are but the apt
setting of the chief jewel, -the holy calmness of spirit with which
Oedipus goes to his mysterious doom. In vain would the guardians
of the local rites warn him from the inviolable ground. His inward
consciousness has sealed his acceptance, and in his blindness he has
a light from heaven. He knows that the divine powers do not
ratify the narrow judgments of their ministers, who, in paying honour
to the gods, dishonour them. One soul may prevail with them in
place of thousands if it approach them with a pure intent. He feels
assured of final peace before any outward sign has befallen, by an
intimation which, though not conveyed through the senses, he recognizes
as coming to him from the dread powers. The external
ceremony of purification is performed for him by another, and though
he acknowledges the importance of the form of prayer, he permits
it to be offered for him more for the satisfaction of others, than
because he feels it to be necessary to his own security. His every
word betrays the consciousness that he is now a sacred person,
chosen by Fate for the punishment of his enemies and the protection
of Athens, and that this sacredness is in some way connected with
the sorrow by which he has expiated an involuntary crime. He
has throughout been pure from all taint of guilt, which can only
attach to those who have knowingly done wrong; although his
misery is such as outwardly to put a gulf between him and Theseus.
The guilt is on the head of those who, under pretence of 'driving out
pollution' from their state, have wronged the innocent, and on that
of the unnatural sons, who put forth no hand to save their father.
Here are contained, though still chiefly in the form of feeling, several
ethical principles belonging to the latest stage of reflection in Greece,
and some which find their full expression only in the New Testament.
That mercy is better than sacrifice, and is weightier than the
tithing of anise, mint, and cummin; that involuntary actions are properly
exempt from blame; that the intention is everything in a religious
service; that the height of impiety is cruelty done in the name
of the Gods:- these are so many ways of expressing the inwardness
and the moral nature of religion.
A modern reader is apt to inquire how the consciousness which is
thus expressed was reconcilable with the sincere acceptance of poly-

theism, with the minute observance of a traditional ritual, and with
the belief in omens and signs from heaven. But a moment's reflection
shows that, while philosophy separates, and that only gradually
and in part, between true ideas and the forms of the imagination, it is
of the essence of poetry to combine them. And in dramatic poetry,
the thoughts which lie deepest in the poet's heart, and towards which
he is more or less consciously working, can only appear (though they
are the true light of all his seeing) in so far as they are conducive to
the most effective development of his subject. The plastic art of
Sophocles is nowhere more evident than in the harmony which he
has produced between the external and internal religious elements in
this tragedy. This will become more evident if we consider (a) the
traditional framework and (b) the ethical motive of the composition.
a. The Oedipus Coloneus supplies a good illustration of the separateness
of each Grecian cultus¹. The poet (for whatever reason) holds
firmly to his design of honouring the sacred things of his own deme
exclusively. There was a 'grave of Oedipus' in the temple of the
Eumenides on the Areopagus, as elsewhere in Greece 2. But although
the spectators are seated under the Acropolis, and the Areopagus
is mentioned, there is no thought of any shrine of the Furies
but in the grove at Colonus, or of any monument of Oedipus elsewhere.
In like manner, if Athena is mentioned, it is Ἀθήνη ἱππία (1. 1070,
cp. Paus. 1. 30), if Poseidon, it is as the tamer of the steed, if the
olive is celebrated, it is not the plant in the Acropolis, but the μορίαι
in the Academy. At the same time, the holy things of Colonus were
in great part a repetition of those of the Acropolis, and in celebrating
them the poet indirectly appeals to universal Athenian sentiment³.
The temples of the Furies, or Dirae, and also those of Demeter
(Schol. on O. C. 1. 91) in various parts of Greece, appear to have had
amongst their sacred things a monument of Oedipus, who, like Adrastus,
was the impersonation of atonement for unwitting crime, and
whose name was therefore associated in the popular belief with sacrifices
or peace-offerings for homicide. As one who above all others
had stood in need of propitiation, and had found it from the dreadful
deities, his memory was cherished by those who came to seek a similar
boon. The worshippers figured to themselves that Oedipus or
Adrastus had been accepted, and hence conceived the hope that they
themselves might be cleansed from their sin. The craving for atonement,
to which the worship of the Eumenides was due, thus found a
passing satisfaction. That such a tendency was growing about this
time in Greece we have evidence in its emphatic condemnation by
Plato, who may have included Oedipus and Adrastus, and perhaps
Orestes, among the λύσιοι θεοί (Rep. 2. 366 A, cp. Legg. 10. 906 C).

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
Another proof of the widely-extended cultus of Oedipus is the mention
in Herodotus (4. 149) of a temple at Thera, dedicated by
Aegidae from Sparta (originally a Cadmean family) to the Erinyes of
Oedipus and Laius. This worship, with various modifications of the
legend, which were peculiar to each neighbourhood, probably existed
in several parts of Boeotia and Attica-as, for instance, at the place
called Potniades in the Citheron country. At Colonus it seems to
have been associated with the traditional reverence for one or more
sacred spots, which in some mysterious way were thought to have
communication with Hades, and also, together with the sacred
olive-trees, to be the Palladium of the city's freedom. The possession
of the grave of Oedipus, or rather, according to Sophocles,
of the place where he passed from the upper air, was said to make
Athens secure against Theban invasion. Compare the importance of
the bones of Orestes in the early struggles between Sparta and Tegea,
and of the grave of Eurystheus in Eur. Heracl. 1026 ff. This,
however, was only one of the local sanctities of the Coloniate
district. The land was full of divine presences having two chief
aspects, first as Gods of Sea and Fire and Earth and of the underworld,
and secondly as patrons of the Horsemen; the hero-knight
Colonus being claimed as the eponymus of the deme. The whole
region, even to the 'hollow pear-tree and the stone tomb,' was
loved by Sophocles as his early home, and was inseparably connected
in his mind with the glory and prosperity of Athens. See
below, p. 277.
The poet had therefore a peculiar satisfaction in taking the Passing of
Oedipus as a subject for dramatic treatment. And having made this
selection, he was naturally disposed to connect this Attic fable with
his own former handling of the Theban legend.
b. Here a new motive enters into his design, and it becomes important
to remember that the work belongs to a late phase of the
Greek drama. The limits of the tragic art had long been prescribed
by the idea of Fate, which Sophocles had already interpreted
as an inscrutable Divine Will. Tragedy had darkly mirrored forth
'the wonder and the mystery' of human life. But in the act of
doing so she had stirred such questionings as these. 'Is man then
the sport of a capricious power, which deceives and ruins him without
his fault? Are we to the Gods "as flies to wanton boys?" And do
you tell us that the Gods are just? What justice is there in taking
revenge for an unconscious wrong? Is a princely and loyal nature
like that of Oedipus to be afflicted without end for his father's
disobedience, even if his rash impetuosity, by those who
"potent with such spirits," has been made the means of plunging him
into an abyss of horrors? If human goodness is indeed divine,
why are good men afflicted ? Why are innocent men allowed
to fall into error? If justice calls for expiation, does not a higher
justice require that the "demand of a good conscience" shall be
satisfied?'

Sophocles, who reflects even the latest feeling of his age, was fully
conscious of these difficulties, which he expresses through the person

of Philoctetes (Phil. 11. 450, 1, ποῦ χρὴ τίθεσθαι ταῦτα, ποῦ δ᾽ αἰνεῖν, ὅταν
τὰ θεῖ ἐπαινῶν τοὺς θεοὺς εὕρω κακούς;)-and in thinking over the legend
of his native deme, which was known to comparatively few, he seemed
to himself to have found a partial solution of them. Oedipus, who
is the type of tragic suffering, is also the type of consolation. The
Gods do not contend for ever with those whom they rebuke and
chasten: they will not reject the plea of ignorance: they distinguish
voluntary from involuntary crime: they will accept the atonement of a
pure soul though from a faltering hand. And, while they cannot, or
will not, undo the consequences even of an unwitting action, they will
yet turn the evil into good, and cause a great sorrow to be a great possession.
The oppressed and afflicted man, to whom death appears the
only refuge, shall find peace at last, honoured by the Gods, sought out
and reverenced by the noblest men, blessed in himself, and a source
of lasting benediction to others. Such at least had been the end of
Oedipus, and by such thoughts the poet's treatment of the fable is
modified.
2. Historical and political associations¹. Although the value of a
great ideal poem can be but slightly affected by the consideration of
outward events, the question which has been already touched in
p. 261, whether, besides the religious motive, this drama has not also
a political side, is pressed on us by the nature of the subject.
(a) Historical circumstances. The Oedipus Coloneus evidently
conveys, more directly than the Ajax, an expression of Athenian
patriotism, and in this respect is very closely akin to the Supplices
and Heracleidae of Euripides. These three plays (with the doubtful
addition of Eur. H. F.) may be said, in point of subject, to form a
separate group, apart from all other tragedies composed in the second
half of the fifth century B.c. They agree in glorifying Athens as the
home of equity, the universal refuge for the oppressed: they are concerned
with her relations towards Thebes and Argos. Theseus in O. C.
and Suppl., his son Demophon in Heracl. are representatives of the same
spirit of piety and mercy. In the Supplices there is a threatened contention
between Athens under Theseus and Thebes under Creon.
In the Heracleidae the grave of Eurystheus is represented as giving
Athens the assurance of victory. Certain minute coincidences make
it not improbable that two at least of the three plays were produced
about the same time 2, which, if we are right in assuming the Oedipus
experience of a time of contention.
1 Ideal poetry may often be coloured
by actual circumstances and events, and
it is antecedently probable that an Athenian
drama, in which the chief persons are Athenian
and Theban, should bear some trace
of the hostile relation of Thebes to Athens:
although it does not follow that the
dramatist, whose scene is laid in the heroic
age, must make pointed allusions to particular
incidents of the war. When Milton
speaks of Necessity the tyrant's plea,' or
Close ambition varnished o'er with zeal,'
he is not alluding to particular acts or
persons, and yet he is clearly reflecting the

indicates profound mistrust. Cp. Thuc.

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
Coloneus to be a late play of Sophocles, must have been during the
later years of the Peloponnesian War. And certainly there was no
time in which Athens was more absorbed in her own destiny, or
stood in more need of consolation: none in which her relations to
other states in Greece, and the confidence reposed in her by her
allies, were more naturally causes of anxiety¹; none consequently in
which the spectator of tragedy was more likely to feel respecting the
subjects of these three dramas, τὸν πάντα ὅμιλον καὶ ἀστῶν καὶ ξένων
ξύμφορον εἶναι αὐτῶν ἐπακοῦσαι (Thuc. 2. 36). In Eur. Suppl. the reflection
of contemporary feeling about the conduct of Argos may
be distinctly traced. See esp. 11. 1185, 6.
That Athens was at war with Thebes when the O. C. was written
might be inferred, even if history did not make it certain, from the
hope of conquest over the Cadmeans which is assured to the
possessors of Oedipus' grave. But the passages in which they
are represented as at peace together are such as to suggest that
a strong hope of ultimate friendship must have been entertained.
Theseus cannot imagine how bitterness should ever come in between
them. He says that the hearth of warlike friendship ever
subsists between Athens and the Cadmeans. Not Thebes, but men
of Thebes who are unworthy of her virtuous training are regarded
by him as really in fault (ll. 919, 20). The poet carries back his
audience to a time when it was not the wont of Thebes to nurture
unrighteous men. This is certainly a noble way of speaking, and also
of hearing, about an enemy. Does it arise simply from the ideal point
of view, or is it prompted by some oligarchical sympathy (see below),
or by the desire to strengthen the pro-Athenian party at Thebes?
However this may be, Sophocles has not forgotten his own maxim,
that a foe is to be hated as if he were one day to be a friend. He
may have seen the policy of representing Thebes as only temporarily
misled by her present rulers. Or it may have been inconsistent with
his sacerdotal feeling to speak ill of the city and home of Dionysus³.
(b) Political affinities. Here we touch on ground that is very
uncertain, and not very important. But it is difficult not to connect
the probability that the Oedipus Coloneus was amongst the later plays
of Sophocles, with the fact that the open ground of Colonus was
chosen by the authors of the revolution of the 400 for the place of
are curious, if the truce with Sparta was
formally unbroken. The Heraclidae has
some minute coincidences with the Philoctetes.
Cp. Heracl. 338, 510, 903 (read τοῦ
δ' ἀφέσθαι), 965, with Phil. 156, 451.1304,
1442. Like Soph. O. C. and Ar. Thesm.,
this play bears evidence of the growing
worship of Demeter.
1 Cp. Aristoph. Αν. 880, Χίοισιν ἥσθην
πανταχοῦ προσκειμένοις.
2 It has hardly been enough considered,
what influence religious persons (including
the dramatic poets) may have exercised
in counteracting the isolating tendency of
the passion for autonomy in the several
states of Hellas. The worship of Zeus,
Apollo, Athena, Hera, Poseidon, etc., was
all-pervading, and although Dionysus was
a late comer, yet the people assembled at
his festival were drawn together by powerful
constraining bonds. In treaties it was
before all else provided that the common
ceremonies shall be securely and properly
observed. See esp. Thuc. 5. 18. § 1, περὶ
μὲν τῶν ἱερῶν τῶν κοινῶν... Cp. Ar. Av.

the assembly that was to ratify the appointment of the new council¹.
The formalities with which that assembly was constituted must have
included some acknowledgment of the sanctities of Colonus; probably
an offering to the same Poseidon Hippius to whom Theseus
sacrifices in this play. Was there any predisposing cause for this
remarkable choice of a place for that assembly? The meeting of the
democratic reaction was held in the Munychian theatre, in the midst
of the sailor population. Was the Colonus Hippius in some special
sense the Knights' Quarter*? If so, we can understand why the
poet's celebration of his birth-place should find acceptance with an
important section of his countrymen: who at one moment may have
even desired to nationalize the worship of their patrician 'Mons Sacer.'
(c) It has been common to remark that in the Oedipus Coloneus
Sophocles has given expression to his love of home. But the motive
of a dramatic writing can never be accounted for without considering
the temper of the audience. This taken in connexion with the preceding
observations may permit us to entertain the hypothesis that
the play was prepared for the Great Dionysia of B.C. 411. And although
the following passages may have been written entirely without reference
to passing events, yet, on the above supposition, they would be
peculiarly effective.
(a) 1. 27. The holiest place at Colonus is the stay of Athens.
(3) 11. 66, 7. The people have no voice, but obey the King, who
rules, <ref>l. 68</ref>, not in word only but in power.

the madness of the citizens.

Miletus, Rhodes.
(€) 11. 947 ff. The praise of the Areopagus.
(Γ΄) 11. 811, 2. μηδέ με | φύλασσ᾽ ἐφορμῶν. The years 412-10 в.С.,
when the whole of the Peloponnesian fleet had been liberated by the
Athenian failure at Syracuse, was preeminently a time of naval
blockades.
(5') 11. 1032, 3. μηδὲ τήνδε τὴν πόλιν, κ.τ.λ., as interpreted by the
enemies of Alcibiades, including the Eumolpidae. Cp. Ar. Thesm.

(η) 11. 1593, 4. The compact with Pirithous never to be broken:
i. e. the firm alliance of the Thessalian horsemen. Cp. Thuc. 8. 3.
(d) The author of the second Greek argument has preserved a
singular tradition, according to which the Oedipus Coloneus was
produced in the spring of 401 B.C., four years after the death of
Sophocles. Now, suppose for a moment that the play was first
performed at the Great Dionysia of B.C. 411, when the appointment

possessed a formidable cavalry, had a peculiar
significance for the Athenian Ἱππεῖς.

of the new council was an accomplished fact¹: one can easily understand
that after their deposition it would not be performed a second
time: Colonus had strange associations for the unwilling members of
the silent ecclesia: but in the years after the amnesty, a time of which,
as Grote remarks, the political history is extremely obscure, the suppressed
drama, having no associations with the reign of the thirty,
might be successfully revived.
(e) To sum up what is to be said on this doubtful point :-
(1) It appears improbable that the Oedipus Coloneus should be
composed between B.C. 411 and 405, the year of the poet's death,
because in the Dionysiac theatre, which was neutral ground 2, it would
be undesirable to remind the people of the scene of the appointment
of the 400.
(2) Yet the Oedipus Coloneus is admitted to be a late work of
Sophocles, and for the reasons adduced on p. 275, may be plausibly
referred to the period following 413 B.C.
(3) If the remarks on pp. 276, 7, have any force, Sophocles in
glorifying Athens through Colonus is in so far supporting those who
believed that the salvation of the state depended on a more 'prudent'
method of administration 3.
(4) It is in agreement with these considerations to suppose that the
play may have been performed in the spring of B.C. 411, at the Great
Dionysia, and revived in B.C. 401, after being suppressed in the
interim.
(5) The lasting significance of the Oedipus Coloneus is wholly
independent of any such transitory associations, which notwithstanding,
as is seen in Dante and Milton, may sometimes lend vividness to
thoughts and feelings of universal range.
3. Historic conceptions. The reference to Xerxes and to Archidamus,
which have been generally recognized in Il. 702, 3, τὸ μέν τις
οὔ, νεαρὸς οὔτε γήρα | σημαίνων ἁλιώσει χερὶ πέρσας, is not out of keeping
with the main design. The events so distantly alluded to had become
historical, and were proudly remembered by every Athenian citizen.
Another point is interesting as throwing some light on the poet's
conception of the ancient condition of 'what is now called Hellas.'
The preface of Thucydides, from which these words are quoted,
is evidence of the activity of speculation on this subject in the
1 The Lenaea of 411 B.c., which preceded
the revolution, is not suggested here,
because the poet is more likely to have
written in the interest of a de facto government
than of a political plot.

later years of the fifth century в.с., and the chapters which he devotes
to this subject, together with the third book of Plato's Laws, are
probably a mere fragment of what in modern language may be called
the literature of the question. And, although historic truth is not the
business of the tragic poet, there are differences in this respect
between Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, which are not wholly
without significance. The picture of King Pelasgus, and the description
of his wide dominion, in the Supplices of Aeschylus,
imply no slight effort of historical imagination, and although the
indications in the Oresteia are too slight to enable us to infer the
poet's conception of the old Argive empire, yet the absence of all
mention of Mycenae and Sparta, and the description of Menelaus by
the Argive chorus in Ag. 619, ας τῆσδε γῆς φίλον κράτος, sufficiently indicate
a point of view distinctly differing from that of Sophocles in the
Ajax, and from the Odyssey 1. Are not the two brothers represented
as holding at Argos a joint power like that of the Heracleid kings of
Sparta in the later history, and as ruling the whole Peloponnese,
while having allies in Phocis and elsewhere in Northern Greece?
Similarly in the Oedipus Coloneus, Sophocles has striven to carry
the spectators back to a time, not only before the institution of
democracy, but before the demes of Attica were firmly united in one
πόλις. The deme Colonus is felt by its own members to be a distinct
community, owning the sovereignty of Theseus, the king of
Athens, which they speak of as their metropolis, but retaining the
custody of their own sacred rites, and regarding the ἄστυ at the Acropolis,
with respect indeed, but still from without; with the friendship
of neighbours rather than with the affection of citizens. Thus the
imagination is stationed at the point of time when according to a
tradition which Thucydides believed, Theseus, by a far-sighted policy
which he had power to enforce, brought under one government the
several districts which had previously had their own magistracies and
councils, and had even been at war with one another*.
RELATION TO EARLIER DRAMAS.
1. The obvious connection between the Oedipus Coloneus and the
Oedipus Tyrannus must not be pressed too closely. There are certain
outward resemblances, which amidst so many striking differences
may be merely accidental, such as the number of lines in the opening
speech of Oedipus (13, the coincidence is remarked by Schndw.),
and the long scene which follows the first stasimon (O. T. 512-862,
О. С. 720-1043), similarly broken by short commatic passages and the
entrance of an additional person (Jocasta, Theseus). The connection
of thought between the two dramas has been already indicated. The
Oedipus Tyrannus maintains the absoluteness of the Eternal Laws,
which crush him who violates them, whether he do so consciously or

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
unconsciously. The Oedipus Coloneus declares that the unwitting
offender, although he suffer, shall find peace at last.
A more doubtful question is, How far has Sophocles cared to observe
consistency in his treatment of the fable? For instance, Creon
refuses to expel Oedipus without again consulting Apollo (O. Τ. 1438).
This refusal is clearly referred to in the Oedipus Coloneus (1. 766):
and we read there of a response received by the Cadmeans, which
was brought secretly to Oedipus by Ismene. If we assume a close
connection between the plays, we should infer that this is the response
obtained by Creon in pursuance of the intention expressed by him in
O. T. 1438, and that Ismene brought it to her father at the moment
when he was being driven forth. But if it pointed to his finding rest in
Attica, it is strange that the Thebans should not have been aroused to
jealousy and have sought to detain him. It is better to consider this
point as being external to both dramas, and the oracle as one having
reference to the ultimate fate of Oedipus; and to suppose it brought
by Ismene to him during the earlier period of his wanderings, after
he had been exiled from Thebes.
That the character of Creon is the same in both dramas will hardly
be maintained. In the Oedipus Tyrannus he is gentle, although cold:
in the Oedipus Coloneus, where he plays the part of 'advocatus diaboli,
he is painted in much darker colours.
The feeling of Oedipus towards his parents in the two plays is
different, but the difference involves no discrepancy. There is no
trace in the Oedipus Coloneus of the remorse expressed in the
Oedipus Tyrannus. Nor is it imagined on the other hand that ties
so violently severed can be renewed. He speaks gently of his mother,
but of Laius, though this point is obscure, he seems to imply more
than once his unreserved condemnation (ll. 271, 1390).
In the aged Oedipus we are more than once reminded of the
grand, passionate impetuosity of the previous impersonation. There
is no effort to maintain exact conformity, and the portraiture is in a
different manner, but in working out his new motive the artist is
manifestly conscious of the impression which his former work has
made. See esp. ll. 765 ff., 969 ff., 1375 ff.
And in the pathetic scene between Antigone and Polynices, who
goes forth under his father's curse, the poet indulges in a distinct
allusion to the legend which he had long since made beautiful. This
is far from being misplaced, however, as it casts a softening light over
what would otherwise be too black a shadow. The girl Antigone, at
once affectionate and fearless, and gifted with strength and wisdom
beyond her years, may well be imagined to grow up afterwards into
the heroic maid: and the more prominent part in the action which is
here given to Ismene, though it makes some compensation for the
way in which she is allowed to disappear in the Antigone, does not
obliterate the contrast of character between the two sisters. But
Creon appears in the Oedipus Coloneus as an old man, although in
the Antigone he is represented as in the meridian of life at a later
period. See esp. Ant. 1023, ταῦτ᾽ οὖν, τέκνον, φρόνησον. Αnd the fable
of this play is not presupposed in the Antigone.

INTRODUCTION.
281
Yet Sophocles admits no such glaring discrepancy between his
treatment of the same fable at different times as Euripides must have
done, if the lines quoted by the Scholiast as from the Oedipus of
Euripides¹ are really hisª.
2. Besides the resemblance of subject already noticed, between
the Oed. Col. and Eur. Suppl. and Heracl., this play presents some
points for comparison with the Eumenides of Aeschylus.
The Eumenides is related to the Areopagus with its Cave of the
Furies (where also there was a grave of Oedipus) much as the Oedipus
Coloneus is to Colonus. What most strikes us in making the
comparison is the different spirit in which the Dreadful Ones are
treated in the two plays. With the bold familiarity of an earlier worship
Aeschylus brings the Erinyes in all their horrors upon the stage. It
is true that after coming to curse they remain to bless-just as their
ministers in Sophocles first bid Oedipus avaunt, and then receive him
kindly. But in the later drama the whole conception of these Powers
is softened and beautified³, and partakes something of the delicate grace
of the region over which they preside. They are still δεινῶπες, ‘of
dread aspect,' but we hear nothing of their trailing robes and their
serpent-hair: they are the 'all-seeing,' as elsewhere in Sophocles: but
a holy silence is observed about their vengeful deeds. It is still more
remarkable that in threatening the Thebans with his ἀλάστωρ Oedipus
makes no pointed reference to the Erinyes whose protection he has
sought, and that he asks their indulgence before launching his curse
at Creon. He does invoke them incidentally in cursing Polynices,
but without naming them, although in the same breath he invokes
by name both Tartarus and the God of Strife. And Polynices, in
naming the Erinyes of Oedipus, makes no allusion to the Eumenides.
Almost everywhere in Sophocles Deity is an impalpable presence withdrawn
from sight, while not on that account less powerfully felt. But
throughout the Oedipus Coloneus there reigns a silent awe, a spirit of
εὐφημία, which, although intensely Greek, is unequalled elsewhere
in Greek literature. The habit professed by the chorus (ll. 129 ff.)
is steadily observed, and not the Erinyes only, but also Demeter and

2 It has been thought an inconsistency
in the Oedipus Coloneus that the sons of
Oedipus should be cursed for obeying the
oracle which said that the possession of
the person of Oedipus was necessary to
the security of their country. But if the
Thebans had understood the real purpose
of the Gods, they would have received
Oedipus and buried him in Theban soil,
notwithstanding his unwitting parricide.
And oracles, especially in connection with
the driving out of pollution, had become
so much a matter of course on both sides
of every political struggle, that Sophocles
and his audience might both pass lightly
over their religious significance. The inconsistency,
if it is one, is of the same
order with the absence of any atonement
for the blood of Laïus, of which
Sophocles does not seem to have felt the
need. The case with respect to this
might have been different had Oedipus
returned to Thebes. O. C. 271, 1390.
3 As in the art of Scopas. Paus. 1. 28.
§ 6.
So in the Colonus of to-day, perhaps
at the very spot where Oedipus is supposed
to disappear, the Holy Virgin is
worshipped as ἡ Ἐλαιοῦσα, which the sacristan
explains to mean not 'the merciful,'
(from ἔλεος), but 'the guardian of
the olive,' ἡ ποιοῦσα τὰς ἐλάας ἀναθῆλαι.

ff.), are mentioned without being named.
MINOR DIFFICULTIES.
It remains to notice several points of detail.
1. Oedipus is told by the Athenian that the place where he rests
is called χθονὸς τῆσδε χαλκόπους ὀδός, 'the indestructible threshold or
basement' of Colonus or of Attica¹. And in the description of his
passing away he is said to pause and put on fresh garments after an
ablution, when he arrived at the steep-down threshold, rooted in earth
with steps or foundations of brass (or with indestructible foundations).
Is the thing meant in either passage the same or different?
It is no doubt possible that they are different. We may either
suppose that two places in the grove where the native rock appeared
were similarly named, or that the whole ground of the Eumenides
was called the threshold of the brazen floor, while a particular spot,
where the path became precipitous, (and there were perhaps brazen
steps), was called the καταρράκτης ὀδός. The Scholiast on 1. 192 assumes
that the platform where Oedipus is allowed to rest is the same
on which he sits at first and that it is literally paved with brass. If
so, this would symbolize the primitive worship of the adamantine,
indestructible basement of rock. Or we may read odós in the second
passage only and ddós in the first, although the context does not
favour this. But if the place called ὀdós in the two passages is
one and the same, it becomes necessary to suppose a change of
scene. And this is not impossible. For it is conceivable that
in the πρόλογοs the scene is laid near the spot where Oedipus is
finally to pass away, on the side of the grove which is furthest from
Athens, and that when Oedipus and Antigone, on seeing the approach
of the chorus, have hidden themselves, the scene is changed to the
entrance of the grove on the side nearest to Athens. In favour of
this supposition it may be remarked (1) that Oedipus in the πρόλογος
occupies ground which it is not permissible to tread, but is afterwards
made to sit where all may (ἵνα πᾶσι νόμος), and it is probable
that on both occasions he occupied the centre of the stage: (2) that
the chorus speak of having wandered all round the grove: cp. Aj. 868,
πᾶ, πᾶ, πᾶ, | πὰ γὰρ οὐκ ἔβαν ἐγώ; 3 In either case the word 'brazen' is
1 Schol. on 1. 27: χαλκόπους ὀδός· ὡς
οὕτω τινὸς καλουμένου τόπου ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ
χαλκόποδος ὁδοῦ, φησὶ δὲ Ἀπολλόδωρος
δι᾿ αὐτοῦ καταβάσιον εἶναι εἰς ῞Αιδου· καὶ
῎Ἴστρος δὲ μνημονεύει τοῦ χαλκοῦ ὀδοῦ,

Βοιωτοὶ δ᾽ ἵπποιο ποτιστείχουσι Κολωνὸν,

Cp. the Epic notion of Hades:-
ἔνθα σιδηρεῖαί τε πύλαι
2 This is assumed by K. O. Müller,
Eum. § 83, but he does not explain the
discrepancy.
$ It may be observed that the πρόλογος
καὶ χάλκεος οὐδός.
in Aj., Ant., El., O. T., Trach., is separable
from the rest of the play, although there is
no change of scene.

INTRODUCTION.

probably used in the sense of ' adamantine,' 'indestructible,' and ὀδός
is rather 'floor' than 'threshold.' The native limestone rock, perhaps
with some rifted appearance not now visible, was associated by primitive
religious feeling at once with the 'strong foundations of the
Earth,' as the symbol of permanence, and with the house of darkness'
to which any opening in it seemed directly to lead. This fancy
may have originally occasioned the conservation of the place, as of
similar places on the Areopagus, and on the northern and eastern
sides of the Acropolis, to the chthonian powers.</p><p>
2. In characterizing the spot where Oedipus was last seen on earth,
the poet makes mention of various objects which seem to have partaken
of the sanctity which especially marked this place; the bowl on
which the compact of Theseus with Pirithous was commemorated;
the hollow pear tree-whose ancient look, familiar to Sophocles, is
transferred by him to the Thesean period:-the stone-tomb, probably
a sarcophagus of unknown origin: and the bit of rock from Thoricus,
ὁ Θορίκιος πέτρος, some survival of primitive worship, perhaps a piece
of Laurian ore, cp. the λίθος τρικάρανος of Schol. on 1. 271.
3. Other minute features of the locality are mentioned. We can
never hope to trace them now that the hill of Colonus, long since
bare of foliage, is become a quarry for road metal. When Oedipus
is still within the sacred precinct the chorus express a fear, lest he
should stumble into the sacred grassy dell, where no voice is ever
heard, but the moist basin gathers pure water, or where water is
mingled with honey. The place of offering beyond the grove, to
which Ismene is directed by a more circuitous path, must have been
near to this-where the sacristan dwelt, and the carefully wrought
vessels for the service were kept.
The Colonus must have been for the most part open ground, else it
could not have been made the meeting-place for the ecclesia which
elected the four hundred. But the grove of the Eumenides, round its
eastern declivity, looking towards the hill which was probably that of
Demeter Euchloüs (a quarter of a mile off), was held peculiarly sacred.
The space in front of this, and at its entrance, at the south-eastern
angle, is the scene of the greater part of the play. The place of offering,
where the ministrant poured libations looking towards the daybreak,
was probably at the eastern end, and at the north-eastern angle
(where is now the shrine of 'Ελαιοῦσα) was the most sacred place,
with the memorial of the descent of Theseus to the underworld, with
the memory of Oedipus' last moments, and the associations which
surrounded these. Close by, and still northward, were the gardengrounds
of the Coloniate deme, watered continually by runnels from
the Cephisus. And almost blending with these westwards were the
groves of Academus, and the Morian olives, scarce less sacred than
the plant in the Acropolis, from which one legend spoke of them as
derived. The knoll was crowned with an altar of Poseidon, worshipped
here as in the Erechtheum as the author of horsemanship.

OEDIPUS COLONEUS.
4. A singularity of the Oedipus Colonus is the requirement of the
occasional presence of a fourth actor, which is further complicated by
the difficulty of distributing the parts amongst three actors without
dividing the part of Theseus amongst all three. It has been observed
that the difficulty occurs entirely in the latter half of the play, in
which Ismene is almost a κωφὸν πρόσωπον, and it has been accordingly
suggested that this part may have been here assumed by a supernumerary
(παρασκήνιον). The part of Ismene having been thus divided,
that of Theseus also has to be divided between the second and third
actors. Thus:-
1. The Protagonist takes the part of Oedipus.
2. The Deuteragonist those of the Stranger, Ismene to 1. 509,
Theseus except in ll. 886-1043, Creon, Polynices, the Messenger.
3. The Tritagonist those of Antigone, and of Theseus in ll. 886-
1043.
4. The Supernumerary, Ismene in the latter part of the play.
This is ingenious. But it is equally possible that four actors were
employed (as in Eur. And.), though in each scene the rule is still observed-ne
quarta loqui persona laboret. And Schneidewin, who is a
good judge of such matters, seems inclined to adopt this conclusion.
STATE OF THE TEXT.
Amongst the seven plays the Coloneus was one of those least frequently
read and copied, although it is evident from the ancient
scholia that it was carefully studied by the learned in Alexandria.
The corrections in Lare comparatively few, and a large proportion
of these and of the marginal readings are by hands which
were intermediate between the copying of the scholia and the recensions
of the 14th century. Little has been added to Elmsley's account
of the existing MSS. Three chief families are distinguishable,
those of L, B, and T, the recension of Triclinius. This last, however,
has but little independent value, as it is founded on a MS. of the
second family. Amongst those which agree most nearly with L,
a minor distinction may be made between A, with which R agrees,
and V³, from which Aldus appears to have printed. In some important
readings Lª is independent of L. Some good readings are
quoted from F, a more recent MS. very closely related to L. Thus
we have
I
L
A
V3
L2
B
F
R
2
Vat.
V2
3
T
Farn.
Only a few lines of this play remain in V; see esp. 1. 1517. Ven.
617 has never been collated. It is of the L family, but corrected by
a disciple of Triclinius.
There are many slight corruptions, and some grave ones, in which
all the MSS. agree. The peculiarities of language and of metre
already noticed make the correction of these unusually difficult.

These
words are best taken generally. The
different names of the Furies illustrate
the truth that 'Different customs are
honoured in different places.' Cp. Pind.
Fr. 200, Ἄλλο δ᾽ ἄλλοισιν νόμισμα.
The Stranger, while insisting on the

customs vary. His gentleness and moderation
contrast with the fanaticism
of the chorus. The name Ἐρινύες is
avoided.

The meaning is much the
same whether we read ὥστε, with the
MSS, or ὡς, which is favoured by
the interpretation of the Scholiast, and
is on the whole more probable. For I
will not depart;' cp. infr. 1528,9. The
reading of the MSS, ὥστε, is only explainable,
if at all, as a confused or
mixed thought; Oedipus expressing in
a single clause his prayer that he may
not be driven away, and his determination
to remain, <gloss>That I may remain in
this land which I will not leave.</gloss> Cp.
Thuc. 3. 34, ὥστε ἦν μηδὲν ἀρεστὸν λέγῃ,
πάλιν αὐτὸν καταστήσειν, where the fut.
inf. arises from a slight confusion of a
similar kind. ὡs is simpler and better:
γε
i e. May they be kind to me, for I mean
to stay.
The vagueness of γῆς τῆσδε has been
objected to. But the meaning of Oedipus
is that he is to rest in the soil
of Attica. Cp. 84, 5, ἕδρας.. τῆσδε γῆς.

φορᾶς ἵν᾽ ἔσταμεν. ξύνθημα (from συν-
τιθέσθαι) is an appointed sign, generally
in speech or writing, and especially
one giving direction at a critical moment.
Oedipus is thinking of the language
of the oracles which he remembers.
Cp. Trach. 157, δέλτον ἐγγεγραμμένην |
ξυνθήματ'. Whether the notion of 'comprising
much in little' belongs to the
word accidentally, or is assisted by some
association from συντιθέναι (Εl. 673, ἐν
βραχεῖ συνθεὶς λέγω), is not easy to determine.
Cp. inf. 586, ἀλλ' ἐν βραχεῖ
δὴ τήνδε μ' ἐξαιτεῖ χάριν. Oedipus
means that in praying the dread goddesses
to receive him to rest finally in
Attica, he is uttering the word which
expresses his condition and destiny.
The broken line has here the effect, not
of hurried excitement, but of intense
solemnity.
47. Indeed I am no less afraid to
raise you up, without the city knowing
of it.' By raising him from sanctuary, the
Stranger would become responsible for
his protection. The conjecture οὐδ᾽ ἐμοί

Poseidon is the guardian deity of the

are called 'Theseidae' in Theseus' time,

mean that this threshold of the land'

of lyrical measures between the
chief actor on the stage and the chorus

more regular in structure, and is rather

to be compared with Aj. 201-262, Aesch.
Prom. 114-192, Eur. Med. 131-212, etc.
As in other places where the part
assigned to the chorus is much broken,
it has been attempted to distribute it
amongst the fifteen choreutae, who are
supposed to speak one at a time. But
although some such arrangement is
probable in itself and confirmed by
the comparison of other passages, such
as Aj. 866-960. El. 823-870, Trach.
871-895, it is impossible to determine
the details of it with any approach to
certainty. For instance whether 11. 117-
137, 149-169, were chanted by ἡμιχόρια,
(the asyndeta giving the effect of doubt
amidst eager search), or divided amongst
several persons, or in what order the
individual members of the chorus took
part, are questions which may be asked
but not answered. Ll. 176, 7, 203-6,
229-36, may be assigned with some
probability to the Coryphaeus. See
Hermann's notes.
It is also uncertain how far an antistrophic
arrangement of the metres is
to be maintained. Thus 11. 117-137
clearly correspond to 11. 149-169. But
the anapaestic movement, 11. 138-148,
is not exactly answered by 11. 170-177:
cp. Eur. Ion 227-9: and, while 11. 178-
181, 184-187, severally correspond
(though in the MSS. not perfectly) to
194-8, 203-6, there is again a want of
correspondence between 11. 182, 3, and
199-202. Although these are not anapaestic
measures, it may be observed
that they accompany movements of Oedipus,
which, if they were to be represented
at all naturally, were necessarily
interrupted and irregular, and while it
is of course possible that some lines
have been lost after 183, it is also conceivable
that there may have been an
interval of silence, or that a pause in the
dialogue may have been filled up with
instrumental music. Cp. infr. 1692 ff.
and note, Phil. 1170 1217. However
this may have been, the correction ἡσυ-
χαίᾳ, which brings 1. 197 into accordance
with 182, is probably right.
The long passage 207-254, which
may be regarded as a double epode, is
even less regular, the rhythm changing
several times with the situation. But
the similarity of 207 ff. to 237 ff., which
led Hermann to arrange this passage
also antistrophically, suggests the idea
of a strain which after being interrupted
is again renewed. And the dactylic measures
of the chorus (229 ff.) are resumed,
though with a difference, in the supplication
of Antigone (241 ff.).
The prevailing metre is logaoedic, with
free anapaestic systems coming between.
But 11. 212-15, where a fresh cause of
agitation arises, are Ionic a minore;
and the passage which follows presents
a curious alternation of single paroemiacs
with
The concluding lines, 229 ff., contain a
series of rapid dactylic measures modified
with an occasional glyconic or
iambic rhythm.
The following lines have been objected
to for metrical reasons as they are
found in the MS. text, 117, 121, 2, 3,
134 or 166, 152, 156, 175, 178, 182, 3,
(or 197-202), 205, 212, 220, 226, 247,
252.
The difficulties will be dealt with as
they occur. But it may be remarked at
the outset that the divergences from an
antistrophic structure which have been
noticed above cannot justify what is in
itself unmetrical. At the same time
the variation between CIK
and cc, c c − (134-166) or between
Icchci and
Aclcclc- (182-197),
the shortening of the diphthong in
ναίει (cp. γεραιός), or admission of an irrational
thesis (117), and the resolution
of the long syllable of an anapaest or
dactyl as in 220, although they may
be rejected on special grounds in particular
places, are not to be absolutely
condemned. Lastly, in dealing with
metrical irregularities in the lyrical part
of plays which like the O. C. and Phil.
belong to the latest period of Greek
tragedy, we are haunted by the doubt
whether the changes in music which
began about this time were not already
accompanied with metrical innovations.
In the presence of manifest corruptions,
like that in 1. 152, we cannot firmly
maintain that it was so; yet the fact
remains that the metrical anomalies in
the text of these two plays greatly exceed
the average of corruptions in Sophocles.

Cp. Ant. 829, ὡς φάτις ἀνδρῶν. Oedipus
and Antigone re-enter from behind, and
after several movements, with irregular
anapaestic accompaniment, he is again
seated in the middle of the proscenium,
on a raised platform. The absence of
the conventional palace-front enables
Oedipus to be seen when at the back
of the stage.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="140-141"><p> The chorus are at first too
horror-stricken at the very sight of the
offender, either to discern his blindness,
or to gather the meaning of his words.
This appears from their language in
149, 50, which is most naturally interpreted
as an exclamation on first
discovering that he is blind. The present
words, as Oedipus perceives, simply
express horror at seeing and hearing
the impious one (ἄνομον). In 1. 143
they pass from horror to curiosity. Only
when he directly calls their attention to
it, do they realize the fact that he is
without sight. Schol. οὔπω ἀκριβῶς
ἑωρακότες αὐτὸν τοῦτό φασιν.

144. <gloss>Not altogether one of highest
fortune, that ye should congratulate him
thereon.</gloss> The genitive is in the first
instance attributive, 'One of high fortune,'
but is to be resumed with εὐδαι-
μονίσαι, which governs the genitive, as
in Plat. Crit. 43 Β, πολλάκις σε εὐδαι-
μόνισα τοῦ τρόπου. εὐδαιμονίσαι is

148. ὥρμουν LA. ὥρμων C³ and
epexegetic infinitive. See Essay on L.

Another interpretation deserves notice.
Not one to congratulate ( = olov
εὐδαιμονίσαι) on his first destiny;' i.e.
The destiny which has been his from
birth: ἣν οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοί, ὅτε μιν
τέκε μητήρ. But to this may be objected,
(1) that the infinitive can hardly
stand except as epexegetic; (2) the emphatic
position of πρώτης; (3) the
gentle irony of the former meaning,
which is better adapted to the situation.
The same objections apply to the conjecture
πρωτῆς, i. q. πεπρωμένης (Vauvillers,
Schndw., Nauck.), which is a
word only found in grammarians, and
gives a poor sense.

The use of the optative
mood with av after a relative, following
an imperative, and conveying an implied
purpose, is analogous to the Epic construction
of such passages as Hom. Il.
8. 289 foll., πρώτῳ τοι μετ' ἐμὲ πρεσβήϊον
ἐν χερὶ θήσω, |... ἠὲ γυναῖχ᾽ ἡ κέν τοι
ὑμὲν λέχος εἰσαναβαίνοι: Theocr. 25.61,
ἐγὼ δὲ τοι ἡγεμονεύσω | αὖλιν ἐς ἡμετέ-
ρην ἵνα κεν τέτμοιμεν ἄνακτα. The use
of av in such places is equivalent to the
use of av with the optative in independent
clauses. The usage, however, is
rare, and has not been generally retained
in later Greek.
Ιη εὐσεβίας ἐπιβαίνοντες there is a
confusion of the literal and metaphorical
sense, like that noticed in ἥκομεν,
1. 12. Partly coming where we may
stand without impiety.' like ἐπίβαινε in
1. 178, and partly 'relying on pious
action,' as in Phil. 1463, δόξης οὔποτε
τῆσδ᾽ ἐπιβάντες, where, as here, there
is a reminiscence of Epic Greek. Od.
23. 13, σαοφροσύνης ἐπέβησαν, etc.

those who had seen the sacred place at

195. The form ἑσθῶ is questionable
in Attic, according to Thom. Mag.
p. 483, and Phryn. p. 269. But the
word ἐκαθέσθην, which was afterwards
in common use, may be supposed to
have had a source in the earlier language.
And the alternative reading
στῶ is less in accordance with what
precedes and follows. For this question,
as implied in οὕτως; has been
already answered, and the rejoinder,
λέχριός γ'. ὀκλάσας. is more natural,
when supposed to give assent to a request
to be allowed to sit. <gloss>Shall I
be seated?</gloss> 'Yes, bending low adown
upon the surface of the stone.'
λέχριος, not 'sideways, but simply
opposed to ὀρθός, and probably connected
by Sophocles with λέχος, i. e. halfrecumbent,
bending; cp. Eur. Med.
1168, where it is used of a person ready
to fall backwards. λέχριος conveys the
general notion of a position other than
upright.
196. ὀκλάσας (der. from κλάω) gives
the more particular notion of bending
the limbs together, as one does
who is on a low seat. Cp. Il. 13. 281,
ἀλλὰ μετοκλάζει καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέρους πό-
δας ίζει :-of the coward in an ambush,
who keeps shifting from one constrained
position to another. The MSS. give
0
λάου, for which form, instead of dãos, the
Schol. quotes the authority of Herodian.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="197">
<p><lem>ἐν *ἡσυχαίᾳ</lem>
If the metre is to
correspond to 1. 182, we must read thus
for ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ. The words are commonly
taken to mean, (1) Adjust thy
step to my quiet tread,-Leaning forward
thine aged body on my loving
hand.' i. e. Antigone presses her foot
against her father's to steady him while
he sits down, and, lest he should fall
forward, supports him with her hand.
But βάσει (which the Schol. interprets
τῇ καθέδρᾳ) may be understood to mean
the stone support for the foot attached
to the seat. (2) Fit thy foot into its
quiet resting-place.' Cp. βήματος in 193.
ἡσυχαίᾳ has then associations from
176-177, as well as from the general
silence and peacefulness surrounding the
grove. The repetition of the same
word in a different sense would be less
felt than if we said in English, Step
on that step.'

ἀφορμηθείς, has been commonly accepted;
but the derivation from ὅρμος gives
more point, and is supported by the
language of Oedipus, supr. 148. (1)
Leaving my land;' (2) 'Driven from
the harbour of my land.'

The pleading glyconic rhythms of
1. 207 ff., which were broken off by the
discovery of Oedipus, are here renewed,
and as they proceed are mingled with a
rapid dactylic strain, which meets the
impetuosity of the chorus in 1. 229 ff.
with corresponding earnestness. This
combined movement has given rise to
some doubt, and, in order to keep the
dactylic verse continuous, some would
read in 247, ἐν ὑμῖν ὡς θεῷ, οι ἐν ὕμμι
γὰρ ὡς θεῷ, and in 252, with Triclinius,
οὐ γὰρ ἴδοις ἂν ἀθρῶν βροτόν. But the
syncopated thesis and change of rhythm
in both places, as in ll. 7, 14, may give
the effect of lingering earnestness (τὸ
λιπαρές) combined with the eagerness of
her supplication. On the other hand
the slight alteration of the last two
lines, approved by Hermann, appears
probable on comparing 11. 235, 6. The
MS. reading of 253 may be scanned
Cp. infr. 1676, 1703.
In comparing this passage with El.
236-50 on the one hand, and on the
other with Phil. 1170-1217, Eur. Or.
1452-1503, we seem to trace the increasing
use of monostrophic μέλη
ἀπὸ σκηνῆς. From the Aj., Ant., O. T.,
Trach. this phenomenon is absent, except
in such short epodes as Ant. 876-
81, ἄκλαυτος, ἄφιλος .. οὐδεὶς φίλων
στενάζει.
In the scheme of metres on pp. 301, 2,
it has been thought better not to divide
the strophes into parts. Their structure
will be sufficiently evident to the
student, although a sharp division between
the main portion of each, and
the prelude or conclusion, can hardly be
maintained.

This is not merely
a propitiatory epithet = 'as you are mer-
ciful, have mercy,' but is addressed to
the religious spirit which the chorus
have shown. As you are full of reverence
for the Gods, have respect to
the suppliant.' Antigone appeals from
the religion of custom to the religion
of the heart, and the way is thus
prepared for the rebuke of Oedipus in
277-278.

252. βροτῶν was altered to βροτόν by

See note on 237 ff.
254 ff These lines of the chorus, and
the preceding speech of Antigone, were
suspected by some ancient critics. But
they are justly defended by the Scholiast,
who observes that the passage
was not obelized by Didymus. The
lyrical interchange is followed as usual
by a dialogue in senarii. Cp. esp. El.
251 ff. The chorus are ignorant of the
divine purposes towards Oedipus, and
are simply bent on defending the sacred
precinct which is entrusted to their
care. But they are not inhuman, and
after the final appeal of Oedipus, who
professes himself the saviour of Athens,
they own that the matter is too hard
for them, and are willing to refer it to
Theseus as the supreme authority.

the ground was a reason for protecting

See on O. T. 316. Seeing
that first of all I was returning a wrong,
so that even had I done it knowingly,
I should not have been guilty. But as
it was, I went all unwittingly on my path
of woe, whereas those who planned
my destruction knew well what they
were doing.' The imperfect tense in
ἀπωλλύμην expresses an intention not
carried into effect (as in διδόναι, κτεί-
νειν, etc.). Cp. Thuc. 3. 57, οἵτινες
Μήδων τε κρατησάντων ἀπωλλύμεθα. The
words παθών .. ἀντέδρων refer to the
parricide: but it is doubtful whether
παθών means simply 'in self defence,'
or contains an allusion to his father's
act in preparing the destruction of his
infant. Similarly it is doubtful whether
1. 274 applies to Creon and his sons, or
again to his parents. There may seem
to be a certain harshness in supposing
Oedipus to speak thus of Laius,
and the tone of 521 ff., 985 ff. is certainly
different. Yet this is the most
obvious interpretation of the present
passage, and receives some confirmation
from O. Τ. 718, 9, 1454, ἵν'
ἐξ ἐκείνων, οἵ μ᾿ ἀπωλλύτην, θάνω. The
peace of Oedipus does not include forgiveness
of those who have wronged

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="278"><p>Do not while you think to

Some editors have attempted, reading
μοῖραν, as in the early recension, or μοίpas,
which is found in two MSS, to
render, Do not, while ye honour the
Gods suppose them to be fates' (or 'a
fate'). By no means,' etc. But this
sharp distinction between God and Fate
belongs to a much later age. Sophocles
would no more have spoken irreverently
of the μοίραι than of the other
deities. And the interpretation has no
meaning that is relevant to the context.
For how would the rejection of Oedipus
imply that the Gods were blind
fates? Was it not rather based on a
misinterpretation of their will? The
conjectures μαυρούς (Nauck), μείους
(Martin) are not more satisfactory.
The best hitherto is Schndw.'s μοίρᾳ
ἐμποιεῖσθε.
With regard to the reading of the
text, which has strong MS. authority,
it may be noticed; (1) that there is no
difference of meaning between μοίραις
and μοίρᾳ, if this is supposed equivalent
το ἐν μοίρᾳ. This poetical al dative plural
occurs in Plat. Legg. 923 Β, τὸ ἑνὸς
ἑκάστου κατατιθεὶς ἐν μοίραις ἐλάττοσι
δικαίως. (2) Next, that the omission
of ev, or the substitution of the instrumental
dative (Essay on L. § 14 p. 20)
is supported by the similar use of τιμαῖς
(r mg. C²*.
275

278. μοί-
= ἐν τιμῇ ἀγόμενος, in Ο. Τ. 909, κούδα-
μοῦ τιμαῖς Ἀπόλλων ἐμφανής. See note
in loco. (3) This explanation of μοίραις
requires μηδαμῶς to be taken separately
from μή, and to have the force of an
independent negative. This is very unusual,
but may be defended, a. by the
consideration that μή negatives the sentence
as a whole, and a subordinate
negative is therefore more easily admissible;
b. that μηδαμῶς may be taken
closely with μοίραις after ποιεῖσθε = ὥστε
μηδαμῶς ἐν μοίραις εἶναι. c. In Plat. Legg.
11, 913 A, there is a parallel instance
in a participial clause, μηδ' αὖ κινήσειε
μηδὲ τὸ βραχύτατον ἐμὲ μηδαμῇ μηδαμῶς
πείθων. <gloss>Nor again let him move anything,
however small, without any sort
of consent from me.</gloss> And in El. 336,
καὶ μὴ δοκεῖν μὲν δρᾶν τι, πημαίνειν δὲ
μή, although the force of μή is continued
in the latter part of the line, the
second μή has an independent force.
Cp. also Eur Erechth. fr. 362. 1. 46,
οὐδ᾽ ἀντ᾿ ἐλάας χρυσέας τε Γοργόνος |

φάνοισι, Παλλὰς δ᾽ οὐδαμοῦ τιμήσεται.
The antithesis between the literal observance
of the local sanctities and the
higher obligations of justice and mercy
is the point of this part of the play.
Cp. Phil. 451. 2, ποῦ χρὴ τίθεσθαι
ταῦτα, ποῦ δ᾽ αἰνεῖν, ὅταν | τὰ θεῖ᾽ ἐπαι-
νῶν, τοὺς θεοὺς εὕρω κακούς; Ant. 924,
τὴν δυσσέβειαν εὐσεβοῦσ᾽ ἐκτησάμην, for
similar contrasts of expression. The
use of μοῖρα for τιμή is in keeping with
the language of the play. See Introduction,

<p>Editors since Musgrave, who

lines, placing 328 between 330 and 331,
on the ground that Ismene cannot be
supposed to touch herself. Not much
is gained by this: for Ismene is rather
struck by the contrast of her father's
and her sister's mode of life to her own
at Thebes than by the misery she shares
with them. And the construction of a
reply, in this sort of dialogue, is not to
be pressed too closely. Cp. amongst

Although ἀλιτήριος

defended by comparing ἀλείτης, ἄλοιτος.
Eustathius mentions ἀλιτηρός as a word

by the reading ἀλητηροῦ, is the
most probable. The heaven-sent infatuation,

after a relative adverb with av. Some
editors have changed κρατῆς το κρατοῖς.
But although this is favoured by the
explanation of the Scholiast, ὅπου κρα-

<p>It may seem unreasonable in
Oedipus to expect his sons to disregard
the interest and the law of Thebes. But
he is absorbed in his own destiny, and
is full of indignation at the thought of
being taken to the borders of his country
without being restored to it. This he
thinks that his sons ought to have interfered
to prevent. He regards the oracle
as expressing the intention of Phoebus
to glorify him at the expense of his
countrymen if they persist in rejecting 
him. See Introduction, p. 281, note 2.

there seems no reason to suspect

there is no motive for a twofold resolution

Ismene having gone to perform the sacred
rites, there is a further pause before
the arrival of Theseus.
510, foll. The pause is filled by a short
lyrical interchange between the several
members of the chorus and Oedipus,
who is thus brought to make confession
while Ismene performs her offering.
But his confession is a defence. The
chorus, although importunate, are gentler
than in the former scene. The
opening line is scanned as choriambic,
although it may perhaps be questioned
whether the Ionic metre, which occurs
above in 11. 212 ff., is not more suitable
here and in 517. The other metres in
the Ist strophe and antistrophe are
logaoedic, with one iambic colon (518 =
532); those of the 2nd strophe and
antistrophe are mostly iambic. The

<p><lem>τᾶς σᾶς *ἃ πέπονθ᾽ ἀναιδή</lem>
This
conjectural reading. as well as the other
which has been proposed, τᾶς σᾶς, πέ-
πον, ἔργ᾿ ἀναιδῆ, has been suggested
partly by the metrical difficulty, and
party by the fact that the Scholiast
appears to have taken ἀναιδή (ἔργα) to
be governed by ἀνοίξῃς. Schol. μὴ πρὸς
τῆς σῆς ξενίας ἀναπτύξῃς μου τὰ ἀναιδῆ
ἔργα. Against πέπον it may be argued
(1) that the word occurs nowhere in
tragedy, (2) that where it occurs in
Homer it is accompanied either by a
noun in the vocative, or by the interjection
4, (3) that it is improbable that
the first person (represented in the Scholion
by μου) should be omitted. The
word πέπονθα is in accordance with the
spirit of other passages of the play
(268, 537), and should be retained. ἃ
πέπονθα is substituted for ἔργα, to which
ἀναιδῆ is added as an emphatic epithet,
'My unwitting deeds of shame.' Hence
ἔργα was naturally inserted as a gloss.
Besides the metrical objection to the
MS. reading. ἀνοίξῃς requires an object,
and the asyndeton takes from the
smoothness of the passage without increasing
its force.

adopted, it must be acknowledged that
we have here a trace of the philosophical
ἀπορία (already suggested by the
Epic oxymoron ἑκὼν ἀέκοντί γε θυμῷ)
which is treated at length in Plato
(Legg. 860, 867 A) and Aristotle (Eth.
N. 3. 1), viz. whether a man acts voluntarily
when he is ignorant of the circumstances.
See Introd. p. 270. Oedipus
must be supposed to mean that in
killing Laius and in marrying Jocasta
he had acted with a right good will
(ср. О. Т. 422, 3, τὸν ὑμέναιον ὃν δόμοις |
ἄνορμον εἰσέπλευσας, εὐπλοίας τυχών),
but that as he acted in ignorance, the
actions were not his deliberate choice.
ἄκων is certainly wrong and is due to
some reminiscence of 1. 694. Cp. Eur.
Ι. Τ. 512, τρόπον γε δή τινα οὐχ ἑκὼν
ἑκών. The expression is more forcible
if, by a slight change. for θεὸς ἴστω,
θεὸς ἴστωρ is read, as in the text.

It has been urged in defence of the
MS. arrangement of the persons, that
the responsive ἰὼ δῆτα is more suitable
to the chorus. But in the present instance
it belongs to the chorus to utter
expressions of horror, and to Oedipus to
confirm them. Cp. supr. 532, ὦ Ζεῦ.
534. This line has been variously altered,
but even if the true reading is
lost. the general meaning is probably
retained. The mistake about the persons
has very naturally arisen from the
suddenness with which Oedipus takes
up the word. This helps to indicate
the excitement of the situation.

to reverse a fact in past time. Cp.
Aesch. Cho. 363-6, μηδ' ὑπὸ κ.τ.λ. ..

the historical tenses with εἰ, ἄν, ἵνα, ὡς,
ὅπως, to express an impossible supposition,
inference, motive, or result, is all
that can be urged in favour of this,
except the comparison of a passage
which has generally been thought corrupt,
infr. 1713, ἰώ, μὴ γᾶς ἐπὶ ξένας
θανεῖν ἔχρηζες. It may be further suggested,
that in both these instances the
unusual construction is assisted by an
echo (or harmonic) of ὤφελον in ἐπω-
φέλησα, and of ἐχρῆν in ἔχρηζες. If
this hypothesis is rejected, we must fall
back on Hermann's interpretation of
the words: 'Accepi, inquit Oedipus, donum,
uxorem dicens, quod ego ut nunquam
a civitate debuerim accipere, ei profui,
i. e. quod ut mihi non unquam daret
civitas, merui. quum eam a Sphinge

546. τί γάρ reiterates the expostulation
of the chorus. τί γάρ has a different
shade of meaning in each of the
three lines, 538, 542.546: (1) 'Why,
what then?' (2) 'But what of this?'
γάρ implying 'that excuse will not
stand.' (3) Why, what is that?'
547. The MS. reading ἄλλους is condemned
both by sense and metre, but
the correction is uncertain. ἁλούς,
adopted in the text. may be explained
in two ways, (1) ἁλοὺς ἐφόνευσα = ἑάλων
φονεύσας, manifesto occidi, I murdered,
and was convicted of the murder:'
ἁλούς proleptic. Essay on L. § 38. p. 70.
Cp. Ο. Τ. 1213. ἐφεῦρέ σ᾽ ἄκονθ᾽ ὁ πάνθ᾽
ὁρῶν χρόνος. (2) 'Being overtaken (by
destiny) I did commit the murder.'
The former meaning gives rather a
better force to καί, and is on the whole
preferable, although the construction of
the participle is more natural in the
latter interpretation. Porson conjectured
ἄνους, (3) being infatuated.' but this
implies a degree of self-accusation, from
which Oedipus in the Oed. Col. is
wholly free.</p>

ἀποσταλείς, the reading of Turnebus,

If this is the right
reading, which, from the frequent confusion
of and o, is not quite certain
(cp. 603), the present is used with future
meaning, as in Aesch. Prom. 513, ὧδε
δεσμὰ φυγγάνω: ib. 525, δεσμοὺς ἀεικεῖς
καὶ δύας ἐκφυγγάνω. Cp. Phil. 1379,
κἀποσώζοντας νόσου. The subject of
κομίζειν (sc. τινά, cp. infr. 933) is to be
gathered from the context. They will
enforce my being taken thither;' i. e.
They will force the consent of Theseus
and the Athenians to this. <gloss>Universe
eos intelligit, qui tradendi Oedipi potestatem
habeant.</gloss> Herm. Another
rendering has been proposed - They
will use compulsion against me to carry
me back thither.' But such a use of
ἀναγκάζω with the infinitive is inadmis-
sible.
590. εἰ θέλοντ᾿ ἄν γ᾽, οὐδὲ σοὶ φεύ-
γειν καλόν] The reading of this line is
very doubtful, but that of L is as probable
as any other. There would seem
to be an ellipse of some such words as
βούλοιντο κομίζειν or the like. But if
they chose to fetch you in case of your
being willing to go, then on your part
it would not be becoming to remain in
banishment.' Cp. Od. 15. 280, οὐ μὲν

'And the same spirit does not last between
friend and friend, nor between
city and city. By a metaphor derived
from the most ancient, and not altogether
lost in modern times, the feeling
of love or hatred is regarded as a breathing
or exhalation. Cp. Aesch. Agam.
1206, ἀλλ᾽ ἦν παλαιστὴς κάρτ᾿ ἐμοὶ πνέων

There is a pause in the action of the
play. Oedipus has now received from
Theseus himself the final assurance of
rest and protection. The scruples of the
chorus have been pacified by the words
of the king as well as by Ismene's performance
of the sacred rites, and the
anxiety of Oedipus has been calmed.
Creon is on his way from Thebes, but
his approach, though apprehended by
Oedipus, is not yet present to the mind
of the chorus. It is in this moment of
tranquil security that the chorus give
their welcome to the stranger, and sing
the praises of Colonus and Athens.

The metres of this ode are composed
with especial care.
The ruling logaoedic rhythm of the 1st
strophe is represented by the following
line
670
which, out of 13 lines, holds the Ist,
5th, 7th (and central), 11th, and 13th
places. 2 and 12, the second and secondlast
lines, also correspond
D
In 3, 4, 8, the logaoedic is shortened to
the ordinary glyconic metre
and in 6, to the Pherecratean
In 9, the rhythm changes to a purely
dactylic movement
which is followed, in 10, by an Iambic
dimeter catalectic
which smooths the way for the recurrence
to the prevailing rhythm. Cp. supr.
229-36, infr. 1675, 6.
The chief movement in the 2nd strophe
is choriambic (II. 1, 2, 6, 8,
I.
2.
6.
8.</p>
<p><lem>(~^~^^~[-</lem>^^11^)
varied with iambic and trochaic, which
in 3, 5, 7, are combined in the 'antispastic'
or syncopated movement
ト
while 4 is trochaic dim. hyper-catalectic
The composition ends with a glyconic
and Pherecratean, 9 and 10, recalling the
rhythm of the former strophe.
The rhythm of the 1st strophe is expressive
of repose and gladness, that of
the 2nd, of triumph (cp. Ant. 139, 153),
ending in repose.</p></div>

other flowers, is tempted by a narcissus
with a hundred heads, which Earth
purposely causes to grow, so as to fix
the attention of the maiden until Pluto
comes. Ancient commentators observed
that the chaplet worn in honour of
Demeter and Persephone was not one
of flowers, but of myrtle, or of ears
of grain, and they proposed either to
read μεγαλᾶν θεᾶν, referring to the Eumenides,
whom Euphorion had described
ας ναρκίσσῳ ἐπιστεψέες πλοκαμίδας, or
to emphasize ἀρχαῖον, with reference to
the former time before Persephone was
carried away. But see note on 685.

Although this allusion to an artificial
process may seem unpoetical to the
modern reader, the latter interpretation
agrees better with πεδίων ἐπινίσσεται,
besides giving a more definite meaning
to νομάδες, and one immediately connected
with Colonus. For a similar

In expatiating
on the glories of their home,
the religious mind of the Coloniatae
dwells chiefly on the rival gifts of
Poseidon, their patron deity, and of
Athena, the special patroness of horsemen
(infr. 1070), and of the Morian
olives (706), as well as of Athens and
of the tree in the Acropolis. The chorus
are thinking chiefly of their own neighbourhood.
Only in 11. 711, 716-9, do
they speak of what relates to Athens
apart from Colonus. The olive-plant
immediately referred to is that in the
Academy, mentioned by Pausanias as

λεγόμενον φανῆναι, Paus. 1. 32. On the
sacred feeling attaching to the Athenian
olive, see also Hdt. 5. 82, 8. 55.
The genitive, γᾶς Ἀσίας, is rather
partitive than possessive, and to be
taken closely with ἐπακούω. 'A thing
such as I cannot hear of anywhere in
the Asian land, nor as having ever
sprung,' etc. The participle βλαστόν
is introduced by an afterthought in
the second clause. The Peloponnese
is called a Dorian island by an anachronism
similar to that by which the
Athenian youth are called Theseidae in
1066. Asia and the Peloponnese are
cited as the two rivals of Athenian
greatness.

of the sentence.</p>

Xerxes could not destroy (Hdt. 8.55),
or the olives of the Academy which
according to Androtion, quoted by the
Schol., Archidamus spared, with the
olive generally.

sense of 'to command an army.' II.

which has been found in this

728-1043. Creon advances with his
two attendants, and deprecating suspicion,
attempts to persuade Oedipus
to come home to Thebes, for his own and
daughters' sake, according to the unanimous
wish of the people. Oedipus,
who is informed by Ismene, and by the
oracles he had formerly received, of the
real intention of the Thebans, indignantly
resents the cruel meaning of the
fair-sounding offer; taunts Creon with
hypocrisy, in first banishing him against
his will, and now trying to draw him
unwillingly from Athens: and utters a
curse on Creon and on his sons.
altercation continues till Creon throws
off the mask of gentleness, avows that
he has seized Ismene, and threatens to
carry off Antigone. The chorus (834 ff.)
expostulate, and call for aid. He per-
The

sists, and sends her away by his servants,
adding reproaches against Oedipus,
and, on the chorus further expostulating,
threatens to lay hands on Oedipus, who
thus provoked, utters a special curse
on Creon. A scuffle ensues between
the two old men: Creon taking hold
of Oedipus to drag him away. The
chorus (877 ff.) again cry aloud for
help, and Theseus, who has been sacrificing
at a neighbouring altar, enters in
haste. On learning what is the matter,
he orders the people from the sacrifices
to pursue the fugitives, and threatens
Creon with arrest if the maidens are
not produced immediately. He is sure
that Thebes will not resent this. She
cannot countenance such violence.
Creon then speaks for himself. He
could not have supposed that Athens
would have cared to protect his kindred,
or would have received an incestuous
person and a parricide under the shadow
of the hill of Ares. Hefurther excuses his
assault by the curses of Oedipus. He is
in Theseus' hands, but will resist harsh
treatment. The mention of hisunwitting
crimes calls forth a fresh outburst of
passion from Oedipus. Theseus breaks
off further conference by peremptorily
commanding Creon to show him where
the maidens are. Oedipus is left alone
with the chorus. Cp. O. T. 512-862.

Oedipus gives to their common calamity

B Vat., followed by Triclinius, but also
in L². The parallel of Thuc. 3. 12, τίς
οὖν αὕτη ἡ φιλία ἢ ἐλευθερία πιστή; the
frequent use of ὥσπερ without a definite
antecedent in introducing an illustration,
the doubtful correlation of τοσαύ-
τη ὥσπερ (cp., however, El. 532, οὐκ
ἴσον καμὼν ἐμοὶ λύπης, ὅτ᾽ ἔσπειρ᾽, ὥσπερ
ἡ τίκτουσ᾽ ἐγώ), and the fact that the
reading τίς αὕτη is not confined to one
family of MSS, lead to the conclusion
that the reading of LAV³, τοσαύτη, like
σημαίνει for σαίνει, supr. 320, is a clerical
error.
τέρψις, repeated by unconscious tautology
from supr. 766, is here active.
776. σοί is accented because of the
antithesis in 781, καὶ σὺ προσφέρεις

were then to make the offer, when the

οὑμός, <gloss>My vengeful spirit ravaging the

ἀλάστωρ makes a harsh expression, and
the pause before ἐκεῖ requires that the
sense should run on to the word immediately
following it. For the general
meaning, cp. Aesch. Suppl. 413-5, μήτ᾿

land, only by dying there.' The comparison
of Aesch. S. c. Τ. 730, ὠμόφρων
σίδαρος | χθόνα ναίειν διαπήλας ὁπόσαν
καὶ φθιμένοισι | κατέχειν, τῶν μεγάλων
πεδίων ἀμοίρους, is just, but the thought is
not identical, for ἐνθανεῖν is in apposition
to λαχεῖν τοσοῦτον, and not merely

Creon angrily repels the claim of Oedipus
to speak for the Attic elders (ἐρῶ

Oedipus' treatment of him. The latter
words refer (1) to the lines in which Oedipus
curses his sons (ἔστιν δὲ παισὶν

835-836. The excitement, indicated by
the broken lines, culminates in the dochmiac
rhythm, to which the diiambus,
ἰὼ πόλις, is introductory. 876-85, following
the second attempt of Creon,
are antistrophic to 833-43, agreeing very
closely (except εἴργου – – in 836 = δοκῶ
879 کں( even to the division of the
words. This lyrical repetition, with
the balanced rhythm of the intervening
dialogue (containing one short outburst
of Creon, 841-55, and one of Oedipus,
864-70), may be compared with O. T.
649-59, 678-88.</p>

<p><lem>εἴργου</lem> • Keep off!'
837. The Scholiast, who, according
to the reading of L, rightly explains
πόλει by ταῖς Θήβαις, evidently assigned
this speech to Creon.
838. Creon, while defying the chorus,
refrains at present from taking part in
the actual violence, which he leaves to
his attendants. It is to one of these that
the words of the chorus are addressed.
838. οὐκ ἠγόρευον ταῦτ᾽ ἐγώ! Oedipus
rather alludes to his prophecy in 605 ff.,
that war would come between Athens
and Thebes, than to his warning in 653,
which is already fulfilled. Creon's present
threat (πόλει μαχεῖ γάρ) comes near
to Oedipus' prediction.
840. The chorus and Creon are giving
opposite commands to the attendant.</p>

<p><lem>χαλᾶν</lem> Το leave hold.'
841. The change to ἔντοποι (cp. Phil.
211), is necessitated by the dochmiac
metre.

explained according as πόλει is taken
to refer to Thebes or to Athens. Either
reference is possibl possible, but πόλει in Creon's
previous speech, supr. 837, is clearly
Thebes. ῥύσιον is that which is held
by one party, and claimed or seized by
another, who is said ῥυσίων ἐφάπτεσθαι
(Aesch. Suppl. 412, καὶ μήτε δῆρις ῥυ-
σίων ἐφάψεται, ib. 314, Ἔπαφος ἀληθῶς
ῥυσίων ἐπώνυμος). (1) Then assuredly
you will quickly pay moreover a heavier
forfeit to my state, for I will seize
not the maidens only. For this meaning
of τίθημι see L. and S. s. v. A. II, 8.
Or (2), 'Then assuredly you will cause
your city to have a still greater prey to
redeem. For πόλει in (2), cp. Eur.
Suppl. 120, ἦλθον ἐξαιτῶν πόλιν, (Adrastus

Elmsley's emendation has been generally
adopted, and has the advantage
of closely resembling 843, προβάθ᾽
ὧδέ μοι. But the correction is uncertain.
(1) Since they are passing all
bounds.' Cp. supra 155. Hermann's
rule, that πέραν can never be used metaphorically,
appears arbitrary, and when
they have just left the stage it is too
soon to say, (2) They are passing the
frontier.' But possibly the words may
mean, (3) They are passing out of
reach.' Cp. infr. 902, ὡς μὴ παρέλθωσ'
αἱ κόραι, and the hyperbolical expression
in 842, πόλις ἐναίρεται.
887. Theseus, perhaps moved by the
strange advent of Oedipus. is sacrificing
at the neighbouring altar of Poseidon, the
chief guardian deity of Colonus. This act,
which is natural in itself, is convenient,
as the Scholiast remarks, for assigning
a sufficient reason why Theseus,
whose presence will be again necessary,
should, when off the stage, be still
within call. The sacrifice also occasions
a gathering of people, who are
ready to start in pursuit of Creon and
frustrate his attempt.
The trochaics are expressive of the
haste with which Theseus comes-θάσσον
ἢ καθ᾽ ἡδονὴν ποδός (890). They are conventionally
associated with the sudden
arrival on the stage or departure from it

Sic. (19. 26), and Dion. Hal. (11. 40),
leave no doubt that ῥυτήρ in this expression
is not a trace but a rein, and that
the use of ἀπό is emphatic. τρέχειν ἀπὸ
ῥυτῆρος, of a horse, would then mean,
'to gallop away from' (i. e. without
check from, without the effect of) the
rein,' and in σπεύδειν ἀπὸ ῥυτῆρος the
notion is transferred from the horse to
the rider = 'to ride at full gallop.' The
phrase is immediately connected with
ἱππότην, but the notion of 'full speed'
is extended to the whole sentence. It
is singular that the ancient Scholiasts
should have lost the key to this expression
as they seem to have done. If
ῥυτήρ were a trace' as elsewhere (Il.
16. 475 etc.), the meaning would be
⚫ without putting to,' i. e. riding, not
driving.

Creon continues his pretence of helplessness:
supr. 956-8. The excessive meekness
of this expression may be thought
hardly consistent with 11. 958, 9, 1037,

expression of contempt for Oedipus, (2)

<p><lem>τὰς παῖδας ἡμῶν</lem>
The genitive
ἡμῶν has something of a privative force.
You have the maidens whom you have
taken from us.' Cp. supr. 821, τὴν
παῖδ᾽ ἔχεις μου; Ο. Τ. 1522, μηδαμῶς
ταύτας γ᾽ ἕλῃ μου. Theseus throughout
represents himself as aggrieved by Creon's
act. οἶμον is an ingenious but unnecessary
conjecture. The word would be
superfluous after ὁδοῦ, supr. 1019.
1022-4. (1) But if men are fleeing with
them in their power, we may spare our
pains, for there are others urging that
pursuit (supr. 897 ff.), whom to have
escaped out of this land they shall never
glory before the gods.' The reading
of most MSS, ἐπεύχονται or ἐπεύχωνται,
is not defensible. For the variation of
x and §, cp. Ο. Τ.
ξ
έ
297, οὐξελέγχων. Par. B. has ἐπεύχων-
ται. For the mode of expression, cp.
Plat. Soph. 235 C, οὔτε οὗτος οὔτε ἄλλο
γένος οὐδὲν μή ποτε ἐκφυγὸν ἐπεύξηται τὴν
μέθοδον : Legg. 10. 905 Α, οὔτε σὺ μή-
ποτε οὔτε ἄλλος ἀτυχὴς γενόμενος ἐπεύξη-
ται περιγενέσθαι θεῶν. Otherwise, (2) 'As
having escaped from whom they shall
never glory over the gods of this land.'
But although Theseus speaks hyperbolically
of the success of Creon in capturing
the maidens as a conquest over
himself, he cannot speak of the Thebans
as glorying over the defeat of Poseidon,
Athena, the Eumenides, Dionysus (!),
etc. who are not gods of Colonus and
Athens only, but universally reverenced
ἐπεύξωνται Βο.
1028, τόδ'
in Hellas. And the order of the words,
especially the position of φυγόντες, is
adverse to this interpretation.
1024. χώρας.. τήσδε (gen of motion)
is added, because when they entered
Boeotia they would be safe.
ἐπεύξωνται contains at once the notion
of glorying and of thanksgiving. Cp.
the exulting language of Ajax in his
imagined victory to Athene, Aj. 92-96,
ὡς εὐ παρέστης· καί σε παγχρύσοις ἐγὼ
στέψω λαφύροις τῆσδε τῆς ἄγρας χάριν..

<p>While Oedipus remains
alone upon the rock, an object of profound
pity, the chorus burst into an exulting
strain, anticipating the victory of
Theseus and the restoration of Antigone
and Ismene.
The fray will soon begin. Would
I were there to see! Where will the
foemen turn to bay? At the pass of
Mount Aegaleon, or by the Eleusinian
shore? There will Theseus rouse the
combat, and the maidens shall be present
at the achievement of their deliver-
ance.
Or descend they now from Phyle,
westward of the rock, the chariots
with the pursuing cavalry? The enemy
shall be overpowered. Mighty are the
men of Theseus: valiant are the horsemen
of our deme. They all are wor-
α.
shippers of Athene Hippia and of Poseidon.
Are they engaged? or is the
action still to be? My prophetic spirit
pleads for the restitution of the muchenduring,
much-wronged, maiden. O
had my vision wings, that, lifted on
some airy cloud, I might look upon the
victory which I foretell!
'Zeus, grant our people the attainment
of the fair prize and Pallas, his
dread child, and ye, Apollo and Artemis,
who love the chase, come jointly to our
country's aid.'
The metre of this chorus, at first glyconic,
passes more and more into slow
trochaic and iambic movements, with
frequent long syllables. The whole is
marked by great solemnity, with an
occasional note of triumph.

The slow (epitritic) movement with

only in lines 5 and 8 is quickened by
the introduction of the dactyl. The

19. The Pythian cliffs' are so named
from the Pythium, a shrine of Apollo
in the deme of Oenoe, probably at the
place now called Daphne. According
to some authorities the Pythium was on
the Megarian frontier. But the place
so designated could not be on the way
to Thebes. Philochorus, quoted by the
Scholiast, says, ἐν Οἰνόῃ.. ἐν τῷ Πυθίῳ.
For the adjective λαμπάς, cp. infra 1060,
πέτρας νιφάδος. The Schol. quotes a
line of Aeschylus describing the Eleusinian
procession, Fr. 376, λαμπραίσιν

description of the goddesses who preside

The word recalls the two bands
of Thebans who had carried off Ismene
and Antigone and would now resist
their rescue. But the second part of
the compound is subordinate. Elmsley
says, “διστόλους ἀδελφάς dixit pro δισσῶν
ἀδελφῶν στόλον.' The maidens and their
captors are spoken of in a single phrase,
as in supr. 902, 1016.

1056. ἀδμῆτας, 'virgin,' perhaps with
the further association of 'unconquered;'
i. e. exempt from captivity, cp. infr 1147.
The latter part of the sentence is adapted
to the nearer subject (E. on L. § 36. p. 65,
2). The first intention was to speak
of Theseus and the captors of the maidens
as joining battle; then the thought
occurs, <gloss>the maidens also will be in the
midst of the fray.</gloss> Hence ξυμμίξειν
with μάχην, or an equivalent word in
the accusative, is changed to ἐμμίξειν
with the dative, and the word for battle
is expanded into the phrase αὐτάρκης βοά,
i. e. either ἑαυταῖς ἀρκοῦσα, 'defending
them,' or αὐτὴ ἀρκοῦσα, <gloss>sufficient without
more ado.</gloss> See Essay on L. § 43.
p. 81, § 56. p. 102, § 3. p. 7. The
latter meaning is probably right. The
word is of good omen, like ἐσθλῶν,
εὔαγρον, infra. ἐμμίξειν (intrans. cp.
προσμίσγω, συμμίσγω, συμβάλλω) is
rightly construed with the dative, and
Boa is used in the sense of a sudden
rally or skirmish, almost = βοήθεια. Cp.

rhythm lucul is not
impossible (for the resolved trochee, cp.
Phoen. 227, 237); but the change of
rhythm from 1. 10 of the strophe (1054)
cannot be justified by such examples as
Phil. 1124-47. When all the difficulties
are looked at together, it seems most
probable that there is some corruption
here or in l. 1054, if not in both. Qy. ἔνθ'

κατά may or may not be genuine, but
Hermann's conjecture χαλῶσ᾽ ἀμπυκτήρια
is somewhat prosaic.

1113. The variety of reading is most
easily accounted for by supposing an
earlier reading ἐμφύντε (which Mudge
conjectured). The singular ἐμφῦσα is
inadmissible, and if ἐμφῦτε is read, the
asyndeton, which is too abrupt for this
place, has also the effect of separating
the dative, τῷ φύσαντι, from ἐρείσατ',
which seems to require a dative. <gloss>Press

is after all a verbal one, for although
Theseus did not go direct from the

If these
words referred to Polynices, as Hermann
thought, Antigone would show less tact
in addressing her father than in supplicating
the Elders (supra 237). Theseus
has indicated a strong wish, as Oedipus Oe
perceives (1178, 1350), that Polynices
should be allowed to come, and also
has expressed a fear that to repulse him
would be to dishonour the God. Antigone
appeals to her father's respect
and gratitude towards Theseus, and
to his affection for his daughters, as
the motives most likely to influence
him.

who observes: 'I think it not quite
impossible to understand the brief expression,
backed up as it is by the
argument which follows, as the language
of earnest entreaty, and that the verb
is to be supplied by the mind. Antigone
had fully presented her request at the
commencement of her speech, so that
what she then said may be considered
as referred to in this short broken sentence,
ἀλλ᾿ αὐτόν. “Nay, but receive
him graciously
there are others who
have had bad sons and fierce anger,
and as they have been charmed into
gentleness by the soothing persuasion
of their friends, so be you." If ἀλλ'
αὐτόν were uttered in a tone of earnest
entreaty, and the speaker abruptly added
what follows, I can conceive that it
would be very intelligible, and if so,
the touching effect of the entreaty would
be heightened by the very fact that the
sentence was unfinished. Antigone
leaves her father to imagine all she
meant to say, and supplies what is
wanting in words by the earnestness of
her manner and beseeching tone of
voice.' There is force in these remarks,
though the quotation of parallel examples
would be more to the purpose.
The MSS. are practically unanimous;
but the aposiopesis is all but unique.
Cp. however Aesch. Cho. 749 ff., where
Schütz and other editors suppose a
lacuna. And in this play there are
several places where the original construction
of a sentence is not carried
out. Cp. esp. supr. 421 ff., 531 ff.,

not well balanced, the metre is improbable,

reading οὐδ᾽ ἔπι κόρος is ingeniously
adapted to ὅταν . . θέλοντος, in the sense,
When one has fallen into an excess of
wishing,' viz. 'and cannot have enough:'

What trouble-vexed mortal wanders

race is exempt from suffering? The
proleptic use of πολύμοχθος, although
curious, is not by any means fatal to
this interpretation (Essay on L. § 38. p.
70). But the inversion of the subject
('What man escapes? What trouble is
not there?' when combined with the
ellipse of ἀνήρ, is somewhat harsh. And
πλάγχθη ἔξω is a strange expression for
ἐξέφυγε. For πλάζεσθαι is generally,
'To miss a desired end;' or to be
driven out of an intended course. <gloss>Who
misses of being miserable?</gloss> (τίς ἔξω τοῦ
πολύμοχθος εἶναι ἐπλανήθη; 2nd Scholiast)
is a paradoxical expression in which
the paradoxical form has no force or
meaning. And if the paradox had been
intended it would have been more pointedly
brought out. The interpretation
of the 1st Scholiast is on the whole
more probable: τοῦτο ἰδίως ἐξήνεγκεν,
βούλεται δὲ τὸ τοιοῦτο σημαίνειν· τίς
ἂν πλαγχθείη τῶν πολλῶν μόχθων; (2)
Which of the many troubles will be
turned aside?' i. e. anticipating the
notion of καμάτων, τίς πολύμοχθος κάμα-
τος πλάγχθη ἔξω, τίς καμάτων οὐκ ἔνι;
<gloss>What troublous woe misses the life?
What woe is not found therein?</gloss> The
retention of the same subject, and the
antithesis of ἔξω and ἔνι, are in favour
of this. The personification (cp. supra
536, μυρίων ἐπιστροφαὶ κακῶν) is in
harmony with the catalogue which fol-

κατάκρας] Cp. Hom. Od. 5.313, ὡς ἄρα
μιν εἰπόντ᾽ ἔλασεν μέγα κῦμα κατ᾿ ἄκρης.
1244, foll. The concluding lines are
an expansion partly of πάντοθεν, partly
of dei, the notions of space and time
being confused. Cp. Hdt. 3. 114, Ἀπο-
κλινομένης δὲ μεσαμβρίης, κ.τ.λ. where
locality is signified in words expressing
the time of day. Some from the region
of the sunset, some with the break of
day, some through the meridian brightness,
some coming with the blasts of
night.' The last expression has been
variously interpreted. The Scholiast
speaks of the Rhipaean mountains, which,
he adds, were towards the west, and
quotes a line of Alcman, ῥιπὰς ὄρος
ἀνθέον ὕλᾳ, νυκτὸς μελαίνας στέρνον. The
north rather than the west is the region
of midnight. But it is not likely that
after speaking so simply of morning,
noon, and evening, the poet would have
perplexed his reference to night with an
obscure allusion to a remote locality.
(2) Some modern interpreters compare
Ε1. 106, παμφεγγεῖς ἄστρων ῥιπάς, and
would render, 'From the twinkling fires
of night,' or, From the glimmerings
of night.' Cp. τὰ νυκτερινὰ φέγγη in
Plat. Rep. 6. 508 C. But this gives no
distinct image, and the antithesis to
ἀκτῖν' does not improve the sense. (3)
Hermann with more probability says,
<gloss>De ventis, quos noctu maxime auribus

percipimus, intelligenda vox ῥιπᾶν.</gloss> Cp.
Apollonius Rhodius,
Apollonius

The slight change

frequent errors in L. And the Schol.

poverty of such a sense, the weeping of
men is not uncommon in Greek poetry,
or even in Greek history. Others
(Schndw.) take μοῦνος = μονωθείς, « Without
companions,' referring to the apprehension
expressed in 1206, 7. This is
rightly rejected by Dindorf. Antigone

Eum. 766, εὖ κεκασμένον δορύ. Although
λόγχη, like ἀσπίς, is sometimes used
collectively, ἑπτὰ ἀσπίδες could never
mean 'seven heavy-armed battalions.'
(2) If τάξις might have the special meaning
of 'a troop of cavalry,' it might mig be
proposed to read λόχοις for λόγχαις.

if once those battalions move towards

Oedipus is absolute: but its immediate
execution depends on the action of Polynices.
Antigone may be supposed to
have these words in her mind when she
entreats her brother to turn his army
back. Infr. 1416 ff. The apodosis to
which μέν looks forward (εἰσόψεται δέ) is
absorbed in the relative clause, ὡς αὐτίκα,
SC. εἰσόψεται.
(2) Retaining που from L, and supposing
ὡs to be pleonastic as in various adverbial
expressions (cp. esp. El. 1452, ὡς ἐτη-
τύμως: Phil. 58, πλεῖς δ᾽ ὡς πρὸς οἶκον),
a different turn may perhaps be given
to the expression. Therefore the eye
of Heaven regards thee, I do not say
for immediate vengeance, since these
battalions are on their march to Thebes.'
In this case Oedipus contrasts the proud
advance of Polynices at the head of the
Argive host (cp. Ant. 119 ff.) with his
impending ruin. For this momentary
suspension of the curse, cp. Phil. 961,
ὅλοιο μή πω, κ.τ.λ. The deferred apodosis
is resumed by implication in
1372 ff. εἴπερ, with the indicative, suits
better with (2): 'if. as you tell me.'
This is a real example of tragic irony.
In this case που is slightly better than
πω, because assisting the ironical expression.

In the edition of Turnebus, ἐρεῖ

Hermann justly remarks, Etiam si
illa fortasse codicis alicuju alicujus scriptura

eam correctori potius quam ipsi poetae

rebus enim non est argutandum: sed
quod codicum et veterum editionum
scriptura tantum abest ut sensu careat,
ut propterea tantum, quia difficilior est,
correctione opus habuisse videatur.'
The interpretation of the passage turns
on the associations surrounding the
word πόλις. (Cp. supra 837, 858.)
Oedipus, in speaking to Polynices of
Thebes, avoids the word πόλις, and uses
ἄστυ instead, because, as he says with
a sort of angry logic, 'Thebes shall never
more be a city to Polynices, who shall
be ἄπολις Θήβης as he is ἀπάτωρ ἐμοῦ'
(1383). It is to be remembered that
the words πόλις and πατρίς were used
by Greeks with the same affection.
ate familiarity, and the same consciousness
of the privileges attaching
to them, as the words πατήρ, μήτηρ,
ἀδελφός, and the like. This is not
equally the case with ἄστυ, which is

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1380-1381"><p> Therefore they have power
to frustrate thy supplication and thy
claim upon the throne.' 'They,' viz.
(1) my curses,' which are the main
subject, the reflection αΐδε ἔδρων
being inserted parenthetically. For this,
cp. Phil. 351, οὐ γὰρ εἰδόμην: 668, καὶ
δόντι δοῦναι: 1034, αὕτη γὰρ ἦν σοι
πρόφασις ἐκβαλεῖν ἐμέ: supra 280, φυγὴν

βροτῶν. Otherwise (2), 'they,' viz.
the daughters, whose virtues justify the
repulse of the son: sc. αὗται τοιαῦται
γενόμεναι. But, although the verb is
thus made to agree with the nearer
subject, the words do not naturally bear
this meaning.
τὸ σὸν θάκημα has been interpreted
to mean thine enthronement,' the whole
line thus recalling the words of Polynices,
supr. 1293, τοῖς σοῖς . . ἐνθακεῖν
θρόνοις. But θάκημα has been used
twice previously of the supplication of
Polynices (11. 1160, 1179; cp. also
1163, 1166); and this meaning is here
in point. Polynices has appealed not
only to his right of primogeniture, but to
the protection of Poseidon, from whose
altar Theseus raised him with a solemn
promise (supr. 1285-90, 1293, 4). Оеdipus
rejoins that both these claims are
quashed by the righteousness of his
paternal curse, which is justified by the
filial ingratitude of both his sons, ap-

the compound παλαιφάτουis subordinate,
so that it is little more than παλαιοῦ,
but with an association from φάτις,
φήμη, cp. Τr. 823; Hes. Op. 257. The
'laws of Zeus' are personified, like the

1389, 90. And I invoke the hated
gloom of the abyss to carry thee away to

there is an allusion to the curse upon the
Labdacidae, 'I invoke on thee the horrid
gloom of Erebus, thy sole inheritance
from our sire:' or (2) simply, 'where my
father is:' or (3), πατρῷος is used as an
epithet of Tartarus, to mark off a special
function; cp. ZΖεὺς ξένιος, ἱκετήσιος, etc.
The gloom of the nethermost abyss,
that avenges fathers.' The dreadful
hell that waits upon a father's curse.'
Taken either way πατρῷον conveys more
of horror than Nauck's κάτωθεν, or

like Όλυμπος, is less definite in Sophocles

Cp. Hdt. 6. 73, ὡς τῷ Κλεομένεϊ εὐωδώθη τὸ

that εὐοδόω is properly followed by the
dative of the person as well as the
accusative of the thing. In the present
case an accusative (e.g. τὸν βίον, τὰ
πράγματα) is easily supplied. Hence
the correction σφώ is unnecessary, and
the conjecture εὖ διδοίη, besides being
unnecessary, destroys a beautiful image,
and the connection with 1432.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1436">
<p><lem>θανόντ'</lem>
To avoid the unusual
elision of of the dative, this has been
explained as an accusative, by a change
of construction; cp. El. 479, ὕπεστί μοι
θράσος ἁδυπνόων κλύουσαν ἀρτίως ὀνειρά-
των: Aesch. Pers. 913, 14, λέλυται γὰρ
ἐμοὶ γυίων ῥώμη | τήνδ᾽ ἡλικίαν ἐσιδόντ᾽
ἀστῶν: Choeph. 410, πέπαλται δ᾽ αὐτέ
μοι φίλον κέαρ τόνδε κλύουσαν οἶκτον.
But it should probably be admitted that
here and in Trach. 677, ἀργῆτ' οἰὸς εὐείρῳ
πόκῳ, there is an elision of the 1, as well
as in Eur. Alc. 1118. Γοργόν᾽ ὡς καρα-
τόμῳ, where however the conj. карато-
μῶν in not improbable, and in any case
the licence is taken with a proper name.
After θανόντι some general word like
ὑπουργεῖν is to be supplied from τάδ'
εἰ τελεῖτε.
ἐπεὶ οὔ μοι ζῶντί γ'] Not τάδε τελεῖν,
but some more general notion of paying
the tribute of affection, is to be
supplied. The inexactness of this is
similar to that noticed in 1410. Elmsley's
conjecture, οὐ μὴ ζῶντά γ᾽ αὖθις
ἕξετον is therefore unnecessary,
as
1440. Cp. Pind. Nem. 9. 21, speaking
of the same expedition, φαινομέναν δ'
ἄρ᾽ ἐς ἄταν σπεῦδεν ὅμιλος ἱκέσθαι (because
of the adverse omens at their
setting forth): Aesch. Prom. 1073, 4,

1447, foll. Polynices departs, and the
end is near. The chorus are reflecting
on the new horror created by the curse
of Oedipus, when a sound of thunder is
heard, which awakens all their superstition,
and is recognized by Oedipus as
the promised summons. He calls for
Theseus, and the chorus repeat his call.
This part of the play consists of two
strophes, divided by three sets of five
iambic trimeters, each consisting of two
couplets spoken by Oedipus, with a
line between them. The prevailing
metre is dochmiac, with iambic and
trochaic movements interspersed. The

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1450">

Polynices
(1426) referred the curse to his
father's caprice: Antigone (1424, 1440)
to some higher inspiration. The chorus
waver between the two suggestions.
Coming from the blind stranger: if
this be not haply the hand of fate.' The
Homeric expression κιχάνει οι κιγχάνει,
is here left without a distinct object.
The Scholiast suggests ἡμᾶς: later critics
αὐτόν: and some have rendered, Evil
comes to me from the stranger, unless
his fate overtake him now.' Cp. II. 22.
436, νῦν αὖ θάνατος καὶ Μοῖρα κιχάνει.
But the emphasis is on μοῖρα, and the
verb is used absolutely. Lit. Unless
it be Fate who in some respect attains
her aim.' τι as cognate accusative in
part supplies the place of the regular
object. This explanation harmonizes
with the next line.

cp. Aj. 646, ἅπανθ᾽ ὁ.. χρόνος
φύει τ᾿ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται:
Ib. 131, 2, ὡς ἡμέρα κλίνει τε κἀνάγει
πάλιν | ἅπαντα τἀνθρώπεια: Τr. 132 ff.:
Hdt. 1. 5, τὰ γὰρ τὸ πάλαι μεγάλα ἦν,
τὰ πολλὰ αὐτῶν σμικρὰ γέγονε· τὰ δὲ ἐπ᾿
ἐμεῦ ἦν μεγάλα, πρότερον ἦν σμικρά. τὴν
ἀνθρωπηΐην ὧν ἐπιστάμενος εὐδαιμονίαν
οὐδαμὰ ἐν τωὐτῷ μένουσαν, ἐπιμνήσομαι
ἀμφοτέρων ὁμοίως. And for αὔξων ἄνω,
infr. 1567, πάλιν σε δαίμων δίκαιος αὔξοι.
In this interpretation ἐπεὶ μέν is supposed
to be used after the analogy of
ὅτε μέν. And this is hardly admissible,
if the usage, ὅτε μὲν
ὅτε δὲ.. is to
be explained, as seems most probable,
by the original identity of the relative
with the demonstrative. Cp. ὃς μὲν .. ὃς
δὲ ..
(2) To meet the difficulty Canter
conjectured ἐκεῖ, i. e. <gloss>In yonder case.</gloss>
Others have supposed that ἐπεί is the
corruption of a verb or participle. The
words τρέπων τὰ ἤδη αὐξηθέντα, in the
confused note of the Scholiast, have
suggested στρέφων (Schndw., who reads
δέδοικα δ' in the antistrophe), i.e. 'turning
backward:' (τρέπει is nearer to the MSS,
but the indicative could not be followed
by a participle with dé coming between).
But although Eur. fr. 540 says φεῦ τὰ
τῶν εὐδαιμονούντων ὡς τάχα στρέφει
θεός, the word is less natural here.
Another conj., which gives the same
general meaning without altering the
rhythm, is áveis, 'letting go'-the
opposite of ἀνέχων οἱ ἐπέχων :-'dropping
some things, and lifting others on
high.' Cp. Aj. 1214, νῦν δ᾽ οὗτος ἀνεῖται :
Pind. Pyth. 2. 89, (χρὴ δὲ πρὸς θεὸν οὐκ
ἐρίζειν) ὃς ἀνέχει ποτὲ μὲν τὰ κείνων,
τότ᾽ αὖθ᾽ ἑτέροις ἔδωκεν μέγα κύδος.
1455-
έτερα CA.
(τάδ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἤματ᾿ B Vat.)
(3) The above conjectures suppose
an alteration of the antistrophe. The
conj. ἐριπὼν μὲν ἕτερα, suggested in our
former edition, requires no further
change, and, in common with that of
Schndw., gives the rhythm (ト​(レト
υιυΐυιτών. Dind. conj.
ἄγων. Qy. ἀπάγων ?
(4) It has been suggested to give
ἕτερα the meaning of 'bad,' ' sinister,'
as in Pind. Pyth. 3. 34, 5, δαίμων δ᾽
ἕτερος | ἐς κακὸν τρέψας ἐδαμάσσατό νιν.
But this does not help us to a clear
context.
(5) The MS. reading τὰ δὲ πήματ᾿
can be rendered metrical by the simple
insertion of γε: τὰ δέ γε πήματ'. But
πήματα αὔξειν ἄνω is not a natural expression,
whether a succession of miseries
is spoken of, as in Aesch. Cho. 1020,
μόχθων δ᾽ ὁ μὲν αὐτίχ᾽, ὁ δ᾽ ἥξει, οι αὔξειν
πήματα is imagined to mean 'to cure
misfortune.' Although the text is uncertain,
the general meaning probably
is, Time casts down some things, and
others that yesterday were mean, to-day
he glorifies. Cp. Aj. 131, 2, ὡς ἡμέρα
κλίνει τε κἀνάγει πάλιν | ἅπαντα τἀνθρώ-
πεια.
1457. Some critics, including Elmsley,
have imagined that the thunder is heard
immediately on the departure of Oedipus.
But a more natural connection is
preserved if the chorus are supposed first
to express the gloomy forebodings with
which the curse of Oedipus has filled
their minds, and then to be panic-stricken
on hearing the thunder. If it had already
thundered, this would in some way have
been clearly announced. See Schol. on
1. 1450, εἰ μὴ κατὰ μοῖραν ταῦτα πάσχω,
εἴποιμι ἂν ἐκ τοῦ Πολυνείκους νέα μοι
κακὰ ἐληλυθέναι. And on 1456, μεταξὺ

ἀποστροφή here and Eur. Fr. 447 is not

1474. There are two strong reasons
for giving this and 1. 1488 to Antigone:
(1) The speeches of Oedipus are addressed
to her and Ismene (1457, ὦ

nature of the passage leads us to expect
an entire correspondence with
1. 1459. It may be added that the
chorus are at present too much occupied
with their own sensations to attend
to Oedipus.

'Gloomy,' i. e. <gloss>Of

(Schneidewin.) Cp. Shakespeare, Macbeth,

And yet dark night strangles the travelling

1482. (1) Reading ἐναισίου (see v. rr.),
sc. ἀνδρός, translate: 'May I meet with
a righteous man, and not from having
seen an accursed man, partake in some
way of his unenvied recompence.' The
construction of συντύχοιμι with the
genitive follows the analogy of ἀντάω,
οι ἐπαυρεῖν. (2) Reading ἐναισίῳ: 'May
I share the fortune of the righteous.'

suggested by recent impressions this
reflection of the chorus is probably
quite general. Such a reference to
Oedipus at this point is certainly out
of the question.
1488. <gloss>And what is it that you would
have thus steadfastly rooted in your
mind?</gloss> Lit. 'What is the steadfast
purpose,' etc.; but πιστόν is proleptic.
Antigone repeats her father's thought
in κατορθοῦντος φρένα, in order to elicit
from him the cause of his agitation;
and asks him for what special reason
he wishes to have his mind clear when
Theseus comes.
1489, 90. In return for their kindness
(I desire) to pay them in full the
promise which I made at the time of
my obtaining my petition.' Cp. Plato,
Legg. 11. 730 Α, οὐκ ἄν ποτε ἀτιμώρη-
τος πάθοι ὁ τυχών: Hdt. 1. 213, δεηθεὶς
.. ἔτυχε, ib. 5. 23, from which it appears
that τυγχάνειν was used in reference
to a suppliant, of obtaining a
request. Cp. also Pind. Pyth. 3. 103.
4. χρὴ πρὸς μακάρων | τυγχάνοντ᾽ εὖ
πασχέμεν. τυγχάνων here is = ὅτε ἐτύγ-
χανον ὧν ἐβουλόμην, οι ὧν ἔπασχον εὖ.
The older explanation (as old as Eustathius)
that τυγχάνων ὑπεσχόμην =
ἔτυχον ὑποσχόμενος, besides making an
imperfect tense equivalent to an aorist,
makes τυγχάνων an unmeaning addition
to the line. The correspondence in
tense of ἔπασχον εὖ and τυγχάνων is a
reason in favour of the explanation given
above.

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1490">
<p><lem>δοῦναι</lem>
Sc θέλω. σφιν has
been explained asol. But this is
wholly without authority, and the common
meaning need create no difficulty,
when 1. 1488 is given to Antigone.
The case of supr. 547 is different, because
the participle there is emphatic.
For the communication of the secret
to Theseus was the bestowal of a boon
on the whole people. Cp. infr. 1496.
προβᾶθι was approved by Elmsley
and Hermann, and secures correspondence
with the strophe. θαυμαστῶς ὁ
χόρος βοᾷ· ἐπείγει γὰρ τὸ πρᾶγμα. Schol.
Observe the recurrence of ἄκραν in
1464, 1491, and of τυγχάνειν in 1491,
1493. Hol my son, come on thy
way (from Athens), or if thou now art
consecrating to Poseidon, God of Sea,
the altar with its hollow surface that
crowns the height,' or (2) ('that crowns
the hill above the hollow place,') 'come
hither!' 'Chorus sic loquitur, ut qui
domi esse Theseum putat: sed deinde
ei in mentem venit, a sacris faciendis
avocatum fuisse, ut ipse v. 1158 (1159)
dixerat, et nunc fortasse in iis peragendis
esse occupatum.' Herm. Ср. О. Т.
517, 1104. τυγχάνεις is suited to express
the uncertainty where Theseus is.
ἄκραν indicates the position of the altar
of Poseidon on the top of Colonus.
ἐπιγύαλον is either (1) a descriptive
epithet, referring to the concave surface
of the altar, or (2) means 'above the
hollow place,' referring to some peculiarity
of the ground, which is no longer
visible. The agency of the Earthshaker
may have been recognised in
some rift of the rock of Colonus, near
which his altar was placed. The read.
ing Ποσειδαωνίῳ may have arisen from
being written over the a of the Doric form.

The apparent anti climax, 'Beloved

Solon prefers εὐτυχία to all else.
1556, foll. In a single strophe and

On this combination, see Christ,
Metrik, § 477- The antistrophe is
distinguished by the frequency of spondaic

emendation, but it may possibly have

Aesch. Ag. 532, Πάρις γάρ, οὔτε συντε-

βαρυαχεῖ is treated by the Scholiast
(see also v. rr.) as the Doric form of
βαρυηχεῖ, a word which occurs several
times, whereas there is only one doubtful
instance, Aesch. Eum. 145, πάθος
δυσαχές, of a compound derivative of
ἄχος. The chorus, who have been
frightened by the thunder, may be
supposed to pray that the end of Oedipus
may be neither painful nor alarming.
In the report of the messenger
they are reassured on this very point.
Infra 1658, οὐ γάρ τις αὐτὸν οὔτε πυρ-
φόρος θεοῦ | κεραυνὸς ἐξέπραξεν, οὔτε

εὐθανασία, cp. Plat. Phaedo, 117 Ε, καὶ

(2) But the metre is in favour of
βαρυἄχεῖ, which, to avoid tautology,
must be explained to mean 'causing
severe sorrow.' By no painful, by
no lamentable doom.' Cp. infr. 1663,

in the possibility of what Ismene
had said, supra 394, νῦν γὰρ θεοί σ᾽ ὀρ-
θοῦσι, πρόσθε δ' ἄλλυσαν. It is doubtful
whether μάταν means (1) 'causelessly,
as some have explained it, or
(2) 'without result,' i. e. bringing no
good after them. The latter is more
probable; i.e. Though no such result
has been produced as yet. σε has been
unnecessarily changed to σφε. The apostrophe
gives liveliness to what would
otherwise be a frigid sentiment. The
change from the 3rd person to the

Hes. Theog. 211, foll., Death is the Child
of Night, without a father, and Cerberus,
ib. 310, is the son of Echidna and
Typhon. But in these genealogies the
poets used considerable freedom. And
in the same spirit in which Sophocles
calls the Erinyes daughters of Earth
and Darkness, Death may be apostrophized
as the son of Earth, who receives
the bodies of the Dead, and
Tartarus, which (cp. supra 1389), like
'Olympus,' has less of a special and
local meaning in Sophocles than in
Homer. The name of Death is omitted,
like that of Persephone, the Erinyes,
and Cerberus, while the kingly title
'Αϊδωνεύς is given to Hades. Cp. supra
1548, and note.

but, like the epithet χαλκόπους,

of βάθρα in the plural, cp. Eur. Tro. 47,

easy correction makes a better context.
The object is to define accurately the
exact position of Oedipus when last
seen, corresponding probably to the
place where rites were since performed

ἀλύπητον has been generally taken
causatively to mean Without giving

were admissible, which is doubtful,
there would be an awkwardness in
having two secondary predicates, εὔνουν

attributive. ἀλάμπετον, 'unillumined,'
the marginal reading of L, may possibly
be right. Elmsley, who was doubtful on

on all accounts to mourn our
father's fatal blood running in our

long incessant toil, and at the last we
have to tell of things beyond the reach
of thought, which we have seen and

with perhaps a secondary
association (pointed by the word ἄλαστον)
from the other meaning of Blood-guiltiness.'

manner of the end, which was inconceivable,
it is more natural that Antigone

which serves as ἐπῳδός to the

as in supr. 182 ff., 197 ff., whether the
two sets of lines, 1689-95, 1715-22,
like those which precede and follow
them, are to be regarded as strictly
antistrophic. That the doubt occurs in
two places so nearly similar, is of itself
a ground for caution. And both rὸ

(on 1. 1371 of the O. T.) that the soul
in Hades was imagined as having all
the characteristics of the person at the
time of death and nothing can be more
natural than that Antigone in the first
moment of her sorrow should speak of
her father as if he still needed tendance
and care. This touch of nature extends
to modern life and poetry. Shak. King
John, 3.4, 'Const. But now shall cankersorrow
eat my bud | And chase the
native beauty from his cheek, | And he
will look as hollow as a ghost, As
dim and meagre as an ague's fit, | And
so he'll die; and, rising so again | When
I shall meet him in the court of
heaven | I shall not know him: therefore
never, never | Shall I behold my
pretty Arthur more.' His age did not
lessen their affection in life, nor should
it diminish their mourning for him in
death. For the omission of the participle,
see Essay on L. § 39. p. 72.

because introducing no unnecessary

the reply is in keeping with the mood

suum posse, quod ne tumulus quidem
patris sibi relictus sit, optat ut ille ne
quaesivisset hanc apud exteros mortem,
sed obiisset potius ita desertus ignotusque,
ut ante cum ipsa per terras
vagus errabat, quo saltem sepelire eum
et justa facere in tumulo posset.' This
interpretation supposes the use of μή
with an historical tense of the indicative
to express a strong negative
wish, as has been already suggested
in the note on supra 540, 1. Ср.
Aesch. Cho. 363 ff. This uncommon
use would be here softened by exppses,
suggesting ἐχρῆν σε, ας ἐπωφέλησα in
541 was suggestive of ὤφελες. On the
other hand, the words in 1714, especially
when compared with 1717, Plat.
Phaedo, 58 C, ἀλλ' ἐρῆμος ἐτελεύτα
φίλων, may very naturally mean, 'As it
is, thou diedst unattended by me,' while
the positive expression of a wish by the
past tense is more doubtful than the
negative. And Mr. Palmer, reading lú
μοι, γῆς ἐπὶ ξένας, κ.τ.λ., gives this
turn to the sentence: 'Ah me! thou
didst desire to die in a foreign land;
yet thou hast thus died deserted by me.'
So also Schneidewin, omitting μή. But
such a resumption of the beginning of
the speech is too inartistic and abrupt
for Sophocles. It is therefore better
to follow Hermann and render, Would
that thou hadst not cared to die in a
strange land, but hadst died as thou
wert, all alone upon my hands.'</p></div>

in the antistrophe it is between single

The number of interlocutions assigned

shows that here as in other κομμοί the
choreutae took part successively in the
dialogue, but in what order they did so

objects that there cannot be degrees of
thinking; but this is hypercritical :

THE great beauty of the Antigone has been recognized by scholars
and poets in every age, from the Alexandrian grammarian, who described
it as 'one of the finest' of the many dramas of Sophocles
which he knew, to Shelley, who wrote to his friend, <gloss>Some of us have
in a prior existence been in love with an Antigone, and that makes
us find no full content in any mortal tie.</gloss>
In recent times the appreciation of this beauty has been somewhat
hindered by the tendency to dwell more upon the ethical than on
the purely human aspect of the situation. The poet's object was
not to set forth a moral antinomy, but to make the spectators feel
with and for Antigone, and in a less degree for the self-wrought
misery of Creon. The supreme triumph of his art consists not in

ANTIGONE.
the clearness with which truth is conveyed, but in the intensity with
which a profoundly tragic subject has been felt. This first principle
of all Sophoclean interpretation is not to be ignored, because
the man 'who saw life steadily and saw it whole' is found to have
had clear thoughts as well as profound emotions, so that in giving
form to his conceptions he could not fail to teach great truths.
But it is none the less necessary for the modern reader of the
Antigone to apprehend clearly the point of view from which the
action was intellectually regarded by the poet.
The vindictive exposure of the corpses of enemies, the importance
of the rite of sepulture, and the closeness of the fraternal tie, are
characteristic features of primitive Greek society, and appear constantly
in the Iliad. We see from the Ajax how hard it was for an
ordinary Greek to recognise the duty of allowing burial to an enemy,
and especially to a rebel; and from the Electra (1. 1487), how natural
was the suggestion to cast out a hated corpse to the dogs and
birds. The struggle of affection against this savagery was probably
the chief interest of the original story of the Antigone (as of the 23rd
Book of the Iliad), but in the time of Sophocles it also evoked a
contrast of wider significance. It is obvious to the student of Thucydides,
how continually in that age individuals must have been
distracted between their obligation to the state and sentiments which
seemed to have an ethical and religious sanction, and which, if
not absolutely universal, had become deeply implanted in the heart
of every Greek. That which in public discussion was the opposition
of δίκαιον and ξυμφέρον, must often have been felt by individuals
as a conflict of feeling against public duty. The religious
Spartan, who, at the command of his generals, put to the sword
the Plataeans who were suppliants at his own fathers' tombs (Thuc.
B. 3.); the Ionian in Sicily taking part with Dorians against his own
race (Thuc. B. 6.); the high-born Corcyrean compelled to do battle
against the mother-state (Thuc. B. 1.); the religious Athenian, if
there were any such, at Melos (Thuc. B. 5.); the Spartans who slew
the enfranchised Helots after they had been presented crowned at the
temples, must have experienced scruples which were more or less
deeply rooted in the Hellenic nature. When Callicratidas refused
to put Greek prisoners to death, his act must have called out some
such division of sentiment amongst his troops. Such experiences may
have helped to strengthen the idea, which was already growing
amongst thoughtful men, of a universal law, not imposed by the will
of a particular state, but, like the will of Zeus, having force everywhere;
not graven on pillars in the market-place, but written in the
heart of man. What was once the solitary speculation of a Heraclitus
or Empedocles was sinking into the general mind. Not that
there was anything like a distinct conception of the law of duty.
The voice of the heart and conscience was indissolubly associated
with the tradition of ages, and was still rather positive than moral in
<pb n="443"/>

its demands. But the notion of unwritten laws which carry with them
an acknowledged reverence (Thuc. 2. 37), which know no difference
of place and date from immemorial time, must always be regarded
as one of the most important stages in the growth of ethical ideas.
In the story of Antigone, as often in Greek history, this notion comes
into sharp conflict with one scarcely less vivid in the Greek mind, that
of the duty of obedience to the ruler (τῶν ἀεὶ ἐν ἀρχῇ ὄντων, Thuc. 2.
37) as the representative of the state. It was not the vocation of the
dramatist, or of his age, to harmonize these opposites. He has represented
both feelings in their passionate working, leading on both
sides, like all unmixed passion, to a tragic end. Yet, although the
conflict of duties is not reconciled, but simply fought out, it is not
left dubious that the 'unwritten' sanction is the higher, and that the
state and its rulers, no less than the individual citizen, are bound to
do it reverence.
The incident in the tale of Thebes which forms the groundwork
of this tragedy appears first in the concluding κομμός of the 'Seven
against Thebes' of Aeschylus (11. 1005-1077). There Antigone and
Ismene accompany the corpses of their two brothers newly slain, and
when the herald announces the decree of the 'probuli,' that Eteocles
shall be buried and Polynices exposed, Antigone declares that she
will disobey the edict, and carry the earth for her brother's burial in
her lap (κόλπῳ φέρουσα βυσσίνου πεπλώματος) She is supported in this
resolution by one half of the chorus of maidens, the other half (with
Ismene?) being deterred by the expressed will of the citizens. It is
probable that Aeschylus drew this and other incidents of the tale of
Thebes from some earlier source, to which Sophocles also had access.
We cannot determine accurately how much of the fable, as the latter
presents it to us, is of his own invention.
But the chief difference between the two accounts is in agreement
with the greater concentration of the later poet. According to both,
Antigone defies what has been proclaimed as the law of the city: but
in Sophocles this law is the edict of a single ruler, whose position
at the head of a victorious army gives him an unquestioned authority.
Thus the contention arises between two individual wills: the one
wholly dauntless, the other only yielding when it is too late. And
the struggle is further embittered by the relation in which the two
chief persons stand to one another, as the nearest of surviving
kindred. It is manifest how much is gained by this, although it may
perhaps be thought that the despair of Creon in the catastrophe, from
the very vividness with which it appeals to the imagination, tends to
a distraction of our sympathies like that which is more strongly felt
in the Trachiniae. And certainly the subject did not admit of such
perfect continuity of handling as that which meets us in the Oedipus
Tyrannus¹. But when the action is regarded as a whole, the
harmony of parts is not less admirable than the spirit with which
every part alike is wrought.

ANTIGONE.
THE ARGUMENT.
Antigone is in the first flower of her youth: not worn and embittered,
like Electra, by long years of oppression and neglect, of dull
pain and hope deferred, but, with the intuition of a strong and noble
nature, keenly realizing all the wrongs and sorrows of her kindred.
She is not insensible to the joys of life. Her recent betrothal to
Haemon, in whose sincerity she finds a response to her enthusiasm,
has filled her with bright visions of married happiness and cares.
But she inherits from her father an ardent impetuous temperament,
a passionate will that is equally sudden and unfaltering in its resolve.
And in her woman's nature this is called forth most surely in the
interests of affection. Love, and especially the love of kindred, is
the moving-spring of her whole being, making her capable of any
act of courage. And of all natural feelings, the strongest in a Greek
woman seems to have been fraternal love (cp. the Electra), while of
all tributes of affection, the performance of the last offices for the dead
was the most sacred: Ant. 905-153 Hdt. 3. 119.
When the play opens she has just heard of the proclamation, and
her resolution is already taken. In tones of suppressed excitement
she communicates her intention to Ismene, proposing that they should
together lift the dead body and bury him. But when Ismene's gentle
and affectionate, but weak and timid nature, shrinks from the attempt,
Antigone's passion bursts forth in full blaze. Young as she is, she has
no fear of death. She scorns the idea of concealment, and harshly
rejects all counsel from the sister whom, in the opening line, she had
addressed with all the confidence of unbroken affection. Supported
by her passion, she is ready to act alone, and goes forth to her 'holy
crime,' while Ismene, left in the palace, betrays by her manner the
secret that is pressing on her mind (ll. 1-99).
The stage is left vacant, and the chorus enter with their song of
triumph. They ascribe the victory to Zeus, who hates the vain glitter
of human pride, and propose to visit the temples of the Gods, with
Dionysus as their leader. The death of the two brothers is lightly put
aside by them as an ill-omened incident of the war.
The chorus are the Theban elders, who have been summoned for
special conference by Creon. He meets them, in full consciousness
of his newly-acquired sovereignty, and of untried but incorruptible
political virtue. His principles may be summed up in one word,
'fidelity to the state.' All private obligations must give way to public
ones, and rebellion is the greatest of crimes. Only, as Creon happens
to be sovereign, disobedience to the state means disobedience to
him: and the self-will which taints his patriotism is allowed to appear
in the concluding lines of the speech (11. 100-222).
No sooner has he made known the edict, than a watchman enters
to report that it has been disobeyed. The union of rusticity and wit
in this man ('the toe of the peasant coming near the heel of the
courtier') makes one of the few semi-comic touches in Greek tragedy
chiefly interesting to us as showing that Sophocles did not deem the
<pb n="445"/>

sophistical spirit inappropriate to the common people. The Φύλαξ,
however, is not merely a foil to the tragic earnestness of Antigone
and Creon, but, by the matter-of-fact simplicity of his description,
even before the detection, unconsciously brings into prominence all
the touching details of the action of the heroine: How her light footstep
had left no trace on the hard earth; how, being unable by herself
to lift the body, or to dig a grave, she had sprinkled handfuls of dust;
how she had frayed away 'the beast of the field by night,' until the
coming of the watchmen relieved her.
The chorus, who have hitherto preserved a respectful silence, now
betray their opinion of the edict by suggesting that this deed of an
undiscovered agent may be a providential interposition.
This at once raises Creon's passion to the height. He suspects
the watchmen of being corrupted, and even the elders of harbouring
disaffection: and threatens the watchmen with death and torture if
they do not produce the malefactor (ll. 223-331).
The chorus, in their amazement at the mysterious act, descant on
the wondrous nature of man: whose marvellous craft is turned sometimes
to evil, sometimes to good. They praise the union of civic
and religious virtue: but the spectator is left to reflect whether Creon
may be thought of as combining both. Then Antigone is brought in
by the watchman, who describes how after Creon's peremptory injunction
they had again exposed the body; how, when a storm interrupted
their watch, Antigone had ventured forth again to see what
had been done; how, on finding the body bare, she had raised a
piteous cry, and, after covering it with dust, had deliberately poured
the triple libation, raising her hand aloft as she did so; lastly, how,
when arrested, she had avowed the deed. The slight pity which
the rustic feels for the maiden contrasts with the exuberance of his
joy at his own escape. Then follows the great scene, in which
Antigone, accused of violating the law, appeals from the human
edict to the Divine ordinances, which are unwritten, but eternal and
sure. Creon bursts forth in an utterance of rage in which his own
action is unconsciously condemned. For in describing how the stubborn
nature is broken, he is felt by the spectators to be pronouncing
his own doom. He at first declares that both the sisters shall die:
then, in answer to the chorus, admits that the law applies in strictness
only to the actual malefactor. The punishment of death by stoning,
which had been originally proclaimed, is to be commuted for one less
bloody but more horrible, that of immurement in a subterranean cell
(probably some primeval burying-place, like the 'treasury of Atreus'
at Mycenae). In a spirited στιχομυθία the two chief persons assert
their conflicting principles, Antigone abating nothing of her scornful
impetuosity and lofty tone, Creon insisting, with unrelenting harshness,
on the vindication of his will, which he no longer cloaks under
political sophisms. Ismene is summoned, and is led in weeping.
Her irresolute though loving nature seeks too late and ineffectually
to be identified with the act and fate of her sister, who repels the futile
attempt with scorn. The extreme bitterness of the situation begins
now to be felt, when Ismene and the chorus plead with Creon for

ANTIGONE.
his son's betrothed one. He is implacable; and, according to
Böckh's notable conjecture, Antigone utters the one word of affection
for Haemon which escapes her throughout the play (ll. 332-581).
The fate of the heroine is sealed. The light that was spreading
on the last scion of the stock of Oedipus is extinguished, and the
chorus take up their parable on the persistence of calamity, and the
irresistible power of Zeus, that works through the vanity of human
wishes, and the infatuation of a mind foredoomed to trouble (ll. 582-
625).
The catastrophe is, however, deferred by the entrance of Haemon,
who, after receiving from his father a lecture on filial obedience and
on the example of public spirit which the ruler is about to set in the
punishment of his kinswoman, pleads indirectly for Antigone, by
recounting the secret murmurs which he has heard in the city; and
suggests the wisdom of yielding to the storm, and not standing too
stiffly against opinion. An altercation follows. Haemon warns his
father of the ruin which Antigone's death will bring upon him, and
is understood by Creon to be threatening his father's life. Creon
threatens to have Antigone slain at once before her lover's eyes;
and on this Haemon goes out abruptly (ll. 626-805).
The chorus sing the power of love, that can so pervert the mind
and overcome the force of law. Yet they admit that the stern legal
principle relaxes somewhat in themselves, when they see Antigone led
forth on her last journey (11. 781-805).
She is somewhat changed in mood. Not that she repents for a
moment of her action, or shrinks from abiding the consequences,
but her heart melts at all that she is leaving, and she complains
bitterly of the injustice of her fate. She is no longer carried forward
by a passionate impulse, as when she was called upon to act, but she
'casts one longing lingering look behind,' and, neither forgiving nor
cursing her enemies, she simply judges them. For a moment she feels
forsaken by the Gods, who do not save her for her piety. Her one
comfort is, that she is going to join those whom she loved. Still she
is resolute, and willing to appeal to the last ordeal. The chorus, who
have tried to console her with the example of Niobe, chant after her,
as she departs, the story of Danae, of Lycurgus, and of Cleopatra,
who all suffered immurement, Danae by the will of Zeus, Lycurgus
for his wild anger by Dionysus' command, and Cleopatra by the cruelty
of others and the hand of fate (ll. 806-987).
All hitherto has gone one way. Now comes the turning-point
(περιπέτεια). The blind Teiresias enters, and solemnly describes the
evil auguries which he has witnessed, and which he interprets as
indicating the Divine anger for the impiety of leaving the corpses
unburied. Creon answers with an outburst of rage against the prophet,
whom he accuses of corruption, and (in the sceptical spirit of the
time) asserts that the Gods are not affected by human actions. But
he will persist, even if the eagles should carry the pollution to the
throne of Zeus (ll. 988-1047).
The prophet is roused, and clearly utters his prediction that a curse
is ready to light on Creon, and that the grave will rob him of his

own flesh and blood in return for having defrauded Hades of a dead
body, and having entombed a living soul (ll. 1048-1090).
The king is at last aware of what he has done. He goes with his
servants, first to bury Polynices, and then to release Antigone. The
chorus utter a wild song of supplication to Dionysus, to come and help
them in the hour of need. But it is too late. A messenger recounts,
in the presence of the gentle Eurydice, who enters just when the death
of her son Haemon is announced, how they had buried all that remained
of the mangled corpse of Polynices, when, as they approached
the vault where Antigone had been immured, a loud voice of wailing
greeted them; how, as they came nearer, it was the voice of Haemon;
how, on looking in through the crevice from which the stones had
been torn, they saw Antigone hanging by her girdle in the farthest
recess (she had once more been resolute), and Haemon clinging to
her; how, on seeing Creon, he had drawn his sword, and, after vainly
aiming a blow at his father, who fled forth, had plunged it into his
own side (11. 1091-1243).
Eurydice then goes out without saying a word: and shortly afterwards
Creon enters with the body of Haemon in his arms, bitterly
lamenting his stubborn folly. He has not gone far in his lament,
when another messenger announces the suicide of Eurydice, whose
dead body is presently brought on the stage by an ἐκκύκλημα. Creon's
punishment is heavier than he can bear. The fierceness of disappointed
affection is concentrated in one thunderbolt upon his head. The love
of Antigone for Polynices, of Haemon for Antigone, of Eurydice for
(2) both her sons, of whom he has bereaved her 'for the public good,' all
flash their curses on him. He is led away, and the chorus moralise
in conclusion on the happiness of moderation and piety, and the fall
that awaits the proud. The aged only, it would seem, can learn from
experience to be wise (ll. 1244-1353).

Oedipus Coloneus, shows a marked change or progress in the
manner of conceiving the state of the dead. Creon, who has a
statesman-like abhorrence of the excesses of religious feeling, has
no consistent notion on this subject, but alternates between scepticism
and common-place. He is only resolved that Antigone shall
not live on earth. She interferes with his policy, and must be removed.
She may marry some one in Hades if she will; at all
events she shall be taught that it is lost labour to show reverence
to the dead. The chorus, in trying to console the heroine, have
only the barest husks of tradition to offer. She will be hidden from
the light of day, but her fate will be renowned hereafter. That is
all the assurance they can give.
Antigone herself has a far clearer vision. She is dead to this world,

and is living for the other. Her dead kindred have more vivid reality
of existence for her than the people whom she sees around her. To
go to be with those who are gone is no cessation of life to her, but
only the continuance of the life which she has been living. Her language
throughout implies her firm belief in the permanence of personal
existence, and it is observable that the source and nutriment
of this strong and unforced conviction is natural affection.
It is true that her anticipation does not find consistent expression.
Even in modern Europe the confusion between the grave and the
spirit-world is deeply inherent in language. And it must also be
admitted that her hopes do not gain strength as she comes nearer to
the fatal moment. They are almost overpowered by indignation and
regret, and the exaltation of feeling under which she acted when the
consciousness of the eternal ordinances and of the eternal abodes
had made her stronger than the whole city of Thebes, seems almost
to have faded away. Yet the hope of rejoining her kindred is unimpaired.
Death, that closes all other hopes and cares, cannot extinguish
for her the light of filial and fraternal love.
2. The Antigone contests with the Ajax the first place in the order
of composition amongst the seven extant plays. The alternation of
anapaestic systems with the lyrical strophes in 11. 100-154, may be
viewed as intermediate between the form of parodos in Aj. 134-200
and that in O. Τ. 151-215, and wonderful as the Ajax is in part,
the composition of the Antigone presents a higher artistic unity. On
the other hand, the anapaestic accompaniment to each successive
entrance, and the entire absence of broken lines in the Antigone, are
instances of a certain archaic formality, which, while admirably suited
to the subject, may also raise the presumption of an earlier date.
3. But while this point must be left undetermined, it may be confidently
affirmed, on grounds of internal evidence, that the Antigone is
the earliest of the three plays of Sophocles that are connected with
the tale of Thebes. Had the story of Oedipus been already worked
out as it stands in the Tyrannus, Ismene could not have implied that
Oedipus had perished before Jocasta, as she does in l. 53, nor could
Antigone have spoken of her mother with so much tenderness as she
does in ll. 466, 7, 898, 9.865; nor could Creon's position as the 'new
ruler' have been quite so simply conceived (cp. O. C. 567, 851).
Had the story of the end of Oedipus at Colonus been worked out, it
could not have been said, 'he perished hated and dishonoured after
putting out his eyes' (ll. 50, 1), nor could Antigone speak of having
prepared him for burial, <ref>l. 900</ref>, cp. O. C. sub. fin. There is no thought
in the Antigone of a death of Oedipus elsewhere than at Thebes;
while, on the other hand, the Oedipus Coloneus contains a pointed
allusion to the Antigone (O. C. 1405-1413).
When this priority is borne in mind, it beomes easier to realize the
comparative simplicity of the legend as here presupposed, and while
some of the separate allusions are more intelligible, we have the advantage
of being able to compare the maturity of Sophocles in the
O. T. with an earlier as well as with a later manner.
4. The view which attributes a comparatively early date to the

INTRODUCTION.
453
Antigone is in accordance with the tradition of antiquity, as implied
in the statement contained in the old Greek argument, that Sophocles
owed his command in the Samian War to the esteem which he won by
the production of this drama. No such story could have gained currency
if the Antigone had been known to be amongst the later tragedies,
and had it really been a late tragedy it would probably have been
known to be so. But modern critics have not been contented with
such a general inference. The single, unsupported statement, repeated
not without reservation¹ by the author of the Ὑπόθεσις, has
led to elaborate attempts to determine such questions as these, Was
Sophocles general in the first or the second Samian campaign? and
consequently, Was the performance of the Antigone prior to 440 or
only to 441 в.с.? In like manner, the coincidence of Ant. 904-15 with
Hdt. 3. 119, and of O. C. 337-341 with Hdt. 2. 35 (an obvious
commonplace), together with an epigram, ᾄδην Ηροδότῳ τεῦξεν Σοφο-
κλῆς ἐτέων ὢν | πέντ᾽ ἐπὶ *πεντήκοντα, of which both the authenticity and
the text are questionable, have been made the ground of much
speculation respecting the supposed intercourse of Sophocles with
Herodotus: and as the latter was interested in Thurii, it has been
even attempted to connect the subject of the Antigone with a particular
incident in the history of the foundation of that colony. This
is surely to heap conjecture on conjecture. That the two writers
have a large common element is a truth that is well worthy of recognition:
but were the tradition of their intercourse more circumstantial
than it is, it might be interpreted in another mood of criticism as a
legend based on this very truth. There is no reason to doubt the
fact of the generalship of Sophocles, and either on this occasion, or
on one of the earlier embassies of which we read in the Anonymous
Life (or why not at Athens?), he may have conversed with Herodotus:
but what is more important and more certain is that he must have
conversed with those who were the informants of Herodotus, the
Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor and of the adjacent islands. And to
return to the question of the date of Antigone, the mere 'they say,'
even of the most accurate of the Alexandrians, is too weak to bear the
weight of inference that is based upon it.
5. Economy. There is no drama of Sophocles in which the main
outlines are more carefully drawn, and none, excepting the first Oedipus,
in which the adaptation of detail to the main effect is more complete
than in the Antigone.
It has been shown elsewhere how many things are made to contribute
to the noble isolation of the heroine, and to the final desolation
of Creon, which the curse of Eurydice renders complete. The skilful
gradation of the action is not less remarkable. First the firm resolution
on either side, with the song of the Chorus, who think only of
Thebè's triumph, coming between. Then the announcement of the
1 He uses φασί.
2 By Mr. Watkyss Lloyd in his 'Age of Pericles.' It may be worth observing that if
the Antigone was prior to the Samian War, the supposed meeting of Sophocles with
Herodotus must ex hypothesi have a still earlier date.

ANTIGONE.
watchman, rousing astonishment in the elders and suspicion in Creon,
but in the spectator only a hushed expectancy, which the ode, πολλὰ
τὰ δεινά, renders more profound. Then the entrance of Antigone,
guarded, who attracts all eyes during the description of her action,
whilst her own eyes are fixed upon the ground: then the sudden flash
of her avowal, and her defiant words. Here tension has reached its
height and the action remains comparatively stationary, so leaving
room for the central ode, εὐδαίμονες οἶσι κακῶν, and for the parts of
Ismene and of Haemon. Then follows the re-entrance of Antigone,
the incomparable Commos, the more questionable Rhesis, and her
final exit in a short anapaestic speech: followed by a solemn lament,
which rather represses than excites the feelings of the spectator. After
this the unbidden coming of the prophet is a relief, and his altercation
with the king calls off the mind from following the maiden to her
doom, until his brief thunderclap of denunciation brings Creon also
to know what he has done. His going forth is followed by a moment
of fond eagerness and anxious hope, to which the report of the
messenger puts a sudden end: though we learn from him that the purpose
of the maiden's death is not unfulfilled. The brief but pathetic part
of Eurydice, and her presence at the recital of the Exangelos, are admirably
calculated to deepen the impression to be produced on the
spectator by a narrative which is a sort of dramatic idyll. The catastrophe,
however, is not yet complete. For in the midst of the final
Commos, as Creon bends over the dead body of his son, confessing his
error, the death of the mother and her curses on the slayer of her two
children are reported to him. Creon's portion as he is led staggering
away is felt to be far worse than death.
6. Many instances of minute care in the composition of the Antigone
have been pointed out by Wecklein and others and will be mentioned
in the notes. It may suffice here to observe that the impatient words
of Creon in ll. 578, 9, ‘Henceforth these must be women and not left
at large,' have the effect of lessening the surprise which the Athenian
spectator may have felt at the liberty which made the first scene
possible and was necessary to the plot. Antigone's opportunity thus
comes to be regarded as a result of the relaxation of female discipline
naturally consequent on the absence of the men in time of war.
7. Time in the Antigone. In one respect, however, such extreme
accuracy was not yet necessary, the spectators being less exacting than
they became afterwards; this is the so-called 'Unity of Time.'
Aristotle in the well-known passage on this subject, while affirming
that the action is as far as possible confined to a single revolution of
the sun, says also that the earliest tragedies retained something of the
Epic mode of treatment. This remark is indisputably applicable to
the Eumenides, and when the Antigone and Ajax are scrutinized in
this respect as Othello has been, it will be found that the inconsistency
which is so manifest in Shakspeare is present, in a minor degree,
even in Sophocles. And if the Athenian spectator was not always
too fastidious on this point, how much less so must the audience of
the Iliad have been!
a. The Argive invasion and repulse described in the parados is

external to the action and may be the more naturally fore-shortened.
But we may begin by observing that the events described by the
Chorus cannot really be imagined as happening in a single day. The
fall of Capaneus, the general engagement, the deaths of Polynices and
Eteocles, the flight of the Argives, to all which must be added the
death of Menaeceus or Megareus, probably filled many successive days
in the original legend.
b. The death of Polynices was the cause which precipitated the
retreat of the Argive host: and this happened in the night immediately
preceding the opening scene, which takes place before the dawn.
The flight occasioned the pursuit, and from this the army did not return
till sunrise. Creon may not have followed far and may have
been recalled by the cares of State, though he is only returning to
the palace when the elders encounter him. But somehow between
night and morning there has been time for the following events :-the
burial of Eteocles with military honours; the proclamation which
reaches the ears of Antigone; her act in sprinkling the dust and keeping
the wild beasts and dogs from the dead; the setting of the watch
by Creon; the summoning of the elders while it is still early morning,
for the discovery of the act by the first day-watch is still recent when
the Φύλαξ comes.
c. But there is more than this; for when the sun has hardly touched
the body of Polynices, supposing him only to have been slain the
previous night, it is already in a state of decomposition (Il. 409 ff.).
d. Again, Creon's authority is not six hours old, and yet he speaks
of certain mutterings of secret disaffection, which he has long since
heard (11. 289 ff.).
e. The word τότε in 11. 391, 480, implies something more than the
space between morning and mid-day¹. And it may be observed in
passing that the storm which filled the sky has not for a moment
interrupted the action on the stage, which is in the open air. See also
11. 559, 855, 1273, for reference to what seems a distant past.
f. There is no trace of the change from stoning to immurement
until 1. 774, yet by 1. 883, all is prepared.
g. Another instance of 'foreshortening' occurs in the speech of the
messenger, where the cutting down of Antigone's body, although a
necessary link in the action, is not mentioned (ll. 1236 ff.).
h. When these points are considered, it will not seem strange that
while for the most part such vague words of time as ἀρτίως, πάλαι, τότε,
are employed, as elsewhere in Tragedy, Teiresias in denouncing the
catastrophe which is imminent should use the phrase 'Not many days
hence,' or that he should speak of the effect which Creon's impious
action has produced on distant cities (11. 1064 ff., 1080 ff.).
And the question may be suggested, whether there are not some
traces in Greek tragedy of that systolè and diastole of the imaginary
time, which Professor Wilson proved to exist in Shakspeare?

ANTIGONE.
LANGUAGE AND METRE.
There is somewhat more of Ionicism in the Antigone than elsewhere
in Sophocles, and the style comes nearer to the λέξις εἰρομένη.
Epic turns like ὡσείτε δυσμενῆ, τῶν [δ᾽] ὑπαὶ γένους, can hardly be
paralleled from the other plays. The mode of expression, though
often subtle, is for the most part rapid and direct.
The chief characteristic both of the lyrical and other metres is the
combination of extreme regularity with great freedom and variety of
adaptation. There are no epodes except the one at the end of the long
Commos, 11. 876-882: and amongst the senarii there are no broken
lines¹. The number of trisyllabic feet is also comparatively small.
Whilst the proportion of end-stopt lines and of couplets, in the dialogue,
is high, light endings are already frequent. There is great
variety of pauses, and often, too, the lines run on without any pause
into long periods, 11. 304-12, 1006-11, 1064-71. This probably gave
occasion to the foolish tale, mentioned in the Anonymous Life, that
Sophocles died from losing his breath in reading the Antigone.
STATE OF THE TEXT.
Fifteenth century MSS. of the Antigone are not very infrequent,
but it is not often found in earlier copies, beyond the select number
of those containing the seven plays. There are few important variations
of the text, but in some instances the unanimous reading of the
MSS. is certainly corrupt: and in l. 4 at least this was so already in
the time of Didymus.
Two considerable interpolations have been suspected, and accounted
for on the uncertain theory of a later adaptation of the drama in
classical times. One of these passages, 11. 1080-3, has been already
defended, so far as the objection against it rests on the limitation of
time; the other, Il. 904-12, reflects an earlier rather than a later phase
of thought, and in this respect is not more surprising in a play of
Sophocles, than the primitive sophisms which appear side by side
with the loftiest conceptions in the central scene of the Eumenides of
Aeschylus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="21">
<p><lem>τάφου</lem>  is genitive of respect with
both participles, but chiefly privative
genitive ve ἀτιμάσας. See Essay on
L. p. 66, 1, 68. She implies that both
brothers had been dishonoured by the
decree. Cp. infr. 515-517, οὐ μαρτυρήσει

know of the edict from hearsay.
</p>
<p><lem>σὺν δίκῃ | †χρησθεὶς δικαίᾳ καὶ νόμῳ</lem>

χρησθείς has been generally condemned,
and ἐχρήσθην only occurs elsewhere
in a strictly passive sense.
Yet, as Shilleto observes (Journ. of Phil.
No. 13, p. 149), ᾐδεσάμην and ᾐδέ-
σθην, the former in lyric verse, the latter
in senarii, are found within a few lines
of each other in O. T. 647, 651; and
χρησάμενος does not occur in Sophocles.
Ἐτεοκλέα ἔκρυψε, χρησθεὶς (αὐτῷ) σὺν
δίκῃ, is not impossible in point of syntax.
On the other hand neither χρησθεὶς
δίκαια, nor χρηστοῖς δικαίᾳ, nor προσθεὶς
δίκαια, can be approved. In 1871 I
suggested προθείς. ‘After laying him
out in state, with the righteous meed of
honour and all customary observance,
he has covered him in earth.' Cp. Hdt.
1. 112, 5. 8, τρεῖς μὲν ἡμέρας προτιθέασι
τὸν νεκρόν: inf. 196, καὶ τὰ πάντ᾽ ἐφ-
αγνίσαι. This part of the treatment
of Eteocles would contrast with the
prohibition even to mourn for Polynices.
Cp. Thuc. 2. 34, where the words καὶ
ἐπιφέρει τῷ αὑτοῦ ἕκαστος ἤν τι βούληται
throw some light on the custom implied
in σὺν δίκῃ δικαίᾳ καὶ νόμῳ. For the
emphatic δικαίᾳ, cp. Αj. 1100, ἐς ταφὰς
ἐγὼ θήσω δικαίως: Hdt. 8. 106, νόμῳ
δικαίῳ χρεώμενοι. προθείς may have
been changed to προσθείς (which Donaldson
conjectured), and to this may have
been added an interlinear gloss ἃ χρή.
Cp. 1. 243. κάφαγιστεύσας ἃ χρή. Another
guess is χρῆσθαι δικαιῶν (sc. αὐτῷ).
For similar fullness of expression on
a solemn occasion, cp. O. T. 219, 259.
25. τοῖς .. νεκροῖς ‘Holding his honours
amongst the dead;' i.e. not ἄτιμος,
or deprived of common rights.

Cp. Eur. Or. 424, ἀληθὴς δ᾽ ἐς φίλους
ἔφυν φίλος. Antigone goes to perform
the sepulture, and Ismene returns into
the palace. The stage is left vacant.
As in the Ajax, there is a distinct
break after the prologue, which has
laid the ground of the action so far as
Antigone is concerned. The first episodion,
ll. 163 ff., is in one sense a fresh
beginning, as setting forth the motives
of Creon, and still only preparing for
the collision. The parados, ll. 100 ff.,
introduces us to the public feeling of
Thebes, and to the wider sphere of
which the action forms the central point.
100 ff. Instead of a long series of anapaests,
followed by lyrical strophes and
antistrophes, as in the Ajax (with which
cp. Aesch. Agamemnon), we have here
two strophes and antistrophes alternating
with anapaestic systems of about
seven lines each: making a form of
parodos intermediate between that of
the Ajax and that of the O. T., in
which there are no anapaests. The
α' (100-9=117-33).
chorus on its first appearance chants
ll. 100-9, then advances while the coryphaeus
recites 110-16, then the antistrophe
is chanted, then another advance
is made during the recitative of 11. 127-133, then strophe B' is chanted, the
chorus by this time standing near the
stage; then they make a final advance,
and, during the second antistrophe, are
standing full in front of the stage.
Lastly, as Creon is seen approaching,
the coryphaeus chants ll. 155-62, which
thus form at once the conclusion of the
parodos and the 'introit' or prelude of
the first episodium.</p><p>
The total effect is that of a stately
and solemn triumph, in which the bright
influence of the glyconic opening is tempered
with slow movements (---),
as in 11. 106, 122, 137, 151, and interrupted
rhythms, as in 11. 103, 120, 138,
152; the notes of triumph and solemnity
being combined in the choriambi,
which bring the lyrical part to a close.
Thus we have-
β΄ (134-40=148-54).

The culmination of feeling is marked
by the dactylic opening of β'. The
rhythms of a' 3. 4, 6, and β' 3, 4, show
the correlation of the two movements.
The adaptation of sound to sense is
specially obvious in the resolved trochees
of a' 7, while the concluding lines, a' 8,
β' 7, serve to harmonize the logaoedic
with the anapaestic measures. Cp. O. C.

(1) 'Such din
of war was spread about his rear by the
reluctant snake, no easy matter to subdue.'
So the Scholiast, who wrote τὸ δὲ
ἀντιπάλῳ δράκοντι ἀντὶ τοῦ ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀντι-
πάλου δράκοντος, ὡς Ἀχιλῆϊ δαμασθείς
(Il. 22. 55). Or (2) δυσχείρωμα may
be taken to mean the act rather than
the object of victory (cp. O. Τ. 560,
θανασίμῳ χειρώματι), and the sense may
be, <gloss>Such din of war encompassed him,
issuing in a hard-won victory for the
serpent matching his foe.</gloss> In this case
it will make little difference to read the
genitive. Or, (3) if the genitive is read
(Wecklein), the words may be taken in
yet another way: 'Such din of war
harassed him from behind, the hard-to-be-subdued
might of the serpent, who
was a match for his foe.' The genitive
is given as an alternative reading by the
1st hand of L, and is supported by V
(Ven. 468). But the dative is alone
recognised by the Scholiast.

The δράκων is certainly the emblem
of Thebes, and the eagle and snake
are in conflict, as in Il. 12. 201, foll.,

escapes : ὁ δ᾽ οὔπω λήθετο χάρμης, | κόψε

The Scholiast, who wrote καὶ

ὑπερόπτας, which appears in the margin
of some copies. The ὑπεροψία of his
interpretation may have given rise to
ὑπεροπτίας, as in conjunction with this
it has suggested ὑπεροπλίαις, (Vauvillers,
who compares II. 1. 205). Musgr. and

The reading in the text is suggested by
that of V (Ven. 468), a MS. of the 13th
century, which, together with many obvious
corruptions, has preserved some
good readings. See on O. T. 1526.
This MS. reading is curiously near the
conj. of Musgrave, εἶχε δ᾽ ἄλλᾳ τὰ δείν᾽.
The epithet, as read in the text, may
be suggested by a forefeeling of what is
coming. Even the end of Capaneus is less
awful than that of Eteocles and Polynices
(144 ff.). Hermann's reading, εἶχε

makes good enough sense; Plat. Rep. 2.

156. The metre requires either the
addition of one (or three) anapaests or
the omission of νεοχμός. Dindorf's
supposition that νεοχμός νεαραῖσι has
grown in some way out of νεοχμοῖσι is
in itself probable enough, but the omission
of some word like *ἄρχων after
βασιλεύς is equally so. The spectator
is thus reminded that Creon is young in

Creon expresses himself in 11. 164, 5.

mere self-will, but an excessive zeal for
the honour of the state, to which all
private feelings must give way (183, 4,
187-90). His spirit of self-assertion is
however already felt, esp. in ll. 173,
191, 207-10. And the unconsciousness
of one young in power is shown in the
self-inculpating words in ll. 175-7. He
characteristically dwells on the virtue of
loyalty (165-9, 209, 10) and the crime
of rebellion (199-202): and his passionate
nature is betrayed by the exaggerated
expression in 1. 208. Cp. O. T. 216 ff.

The connection is not
strictly logical. γάρ explains not the
difficulty of discerning the difference between
rulers, but the essential point on
which the difference turns. In setting
forth this, Creon also declares the spirit
of his own policy. He is feeling his
way with the elders, of whose submission
he is not perfectly sure, and 'beats
about the bush' before coming to the
point with them. Hence he repeats the
same thought in different words.</p></div>

both statements (178-83, 184-90) the

The half-comic or rustic
character of the watchman in this play
is an extension of the common character
of the 'messenger,' whose natural rudeness
of speech and thought brings into
greater prominence the horror or pathos
of the events he describes. The grotesqueness
disappears when he speaks
of the action of Antigone in 407-440.
The employment of this artifice by
Sophocles arises from the same motive
to which Shakespeare gave a far wider
range in such creations as the 'gravediggers'
in Hamlet, and the 'rural
fellow' in Antony and Cleopatra. The
Messenger in the Trachiniae, the Corinthian
in the Oedipus Tyrannus, Menelaus
in the Ajax, the pretended Shipmaster
in the Philoctetes, afford the
same sort of contrast to the more tragic
personages: and the superstition of the
Coloniatae may be compared with the
cowardice of the Phrygian slave in the
Orestes of Euripides.

reply of Creon, τί φροιμιάζῃ; But it is
as unsafe to follow his authority in this
line, as it would be to substitute τί φροι-
μιάζῃ for εὖ γε στοχάζει in l. 241. It is
evident that he is quoting from memory:
and, although it is curious that the
Scholiast uses the same word in his explanation,
οὐ τοῦτο λέγω, ὅτι μετὰ σπου-
δῆς ἀσθμαίνων πρὸς σὲ πορεύομαι, yet this
does not amount to a proof that this is
the right reading. σπουδῆς may be the
word which would be more naturally
used in prose, but it is less pointed than
τάχους in this connection. κοῦφον ἐξά-

<p><lem>σπουδῇ βραδύς</lem> The reading of L,
σχολῇ βραδύς, 'Slowly because I stop-
ped,' is not pointed enough, and it seems
probable that an oxymoron is intended
in this as in the following line. The
correction adopted by the Scholiast,
σχολῇ ταχύς, secures this in rather an
awkward way. That of Seyffert, which
is here adopted (for the collocation of

appears far more probable.

Aldus had it), and as a marginal reading
of Aug. b. and of V¹. 'Clinging fast

expression, well suited to the style of

Shut out from hope,' or 'Fortified by

that we could not know him. Böckh
and Donaldson read as in the text,
interpreting (2) Every man' (πᾶς implied
in οὐδείς, the affirmative elicited
from the negative) 'defended himself
by pleading ignorance of the matter.'
For φεύγειν, * to urge a defensive plea,'
cp. Aesch. Suppl. 390, and for the plea,
μὴ εἰδέναι, Plat. Legg. 11. 936 E. But
the plea of ignorance, although suitable
in 1. 266, is too special for this place,
wherethe non-appearance of the criminal
alone is in question. The meaning given
above (1) is the same as that required by
Hermann (see below), but is more simply
expressed by the epexegesis, and the
imperfect tense expresses the frustration
of continued search. This interpretation
involves a rare use of φεύγω, which is,
however, analogous to a meaning of
ἐκφεύγω that is not uncommon. Cp.
Ο. Τ. 111, ἐκφεύγει δὲ τἀμελούμενον :
Plat. Phil. 17, τὰ δὲ μέσα αὐτοὺς ἐκφεύγει.
Other emendations are ἔφυγε τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι
(Porson), explained by Erfurdt to mean
'amoliens a se accusationem scire sese
negaverat ;' ἔφυγε τῷ μὴ εἰδέναι (Herm.
1839), 'effugit, eo quod nesciebamus;'
ἔφευγε πᾶς τὸ μή, ‘every man pled Not

the further change of νῶτον for λόφον,

express, in a veiled manner, their
emotions at what has occurred. Not
being able to say what they really think,
that Creon's rash edict has already recoiled
on his own family, they descant
on the wonderful range of human enterprize,
adding that where boldness and
resource are combined with justice, they
confer glory, but only bring ruin where
they are subservient to wrong. The
elders do not decide who in the present
instance is the transgressor. The ode
consists of two strophes and antistrophes,
in which glyconic rhythms are mixed
with lyrical dactyls, iambi, and trochees,
in different proportions, the scheme

finds him unprepared. Even diseases,
not to be avoided, are escaped by him.
Inventive beyond hope, he moveth now

deeds of crime. May I never live with

The present implies that the process is
never-ending. Even in the common operations
of husbandry the old religion finds
a ground for awe. The dactyls suit the
thought of the continuous round of human
labour, as those of the antistrophe
express the movement of the steed. The
two long syllables, ἱππει-, οὐρει-, at once
check the flow of rhythm (as with a renewed
feeling of wonder), and by their

trochees. Cp. Eur. Phoen. 1039, 40,

‘By his excellent
wit.' The 1st strophe exhibits the
boldness, the Ist antistrophe the cunning,
of primitive man. The 2nd strophe
and antistrophe describe the higher functions
of civilized life.
349 ff. He not only subdues the animals,
but makes them his servants.'
In correcting this line, the dactylic
metre is to be retained, which is hardly
done in the conjj. ἀμφιλόφῳ ζυγῷ or
ἀμφὶ λόφον ζυγοῖ. The words ἀμφίλο-
φον ζυγόν are sound both in meaning
and rhythm. Brunck's conj. ὑπάξεται,
supplying the preposition required by the
Scholia, would be unexceptionable, if
such a potential use of the future in an
affirmative sentence could be defended.
Blaydes' ὑπήγαγεν would be convincing
if closer to the MSS. In favour of ἐπά-
ξεται it may be urged that the repetition
of the same word is in the manner
of the ode, and that the figurative expression,
he shall bring to his aid,'
agrees with ἄγει, supr. 343. But besides
the questionable future, the construction
of the 2nd accus., sc. ἐπ᾿ ἀμφ. ζυγόν, is
in this case dubious. ὑφέλκεται. . ζυγόν,
'compels to serve him in the yoke,'
may be suggested, although the verb
ὑφέλκειν is not used elsewhere precisely
in the sense required. Else qy.
ἐφέλκεται?
352. ἀκμῆτα is preferable to ἀδμῆτα,
as the rarer word and as introducing a
new and apposite idea.
353 ff. There is a natural progress in
the thought. First, navigation and agriculture
were mentioned as the arts of
subduing the crude forces of nature;
then the capture and domestication of
animals. Now we come to the humanities
and arts of life (the domestication
of man himself), and lastly, in ἀντ. β',
to moral or political good and evil.

such a meaning is unsuitable here. But,
as Seyffert has already shown, the word

Seyffert's ἐς δαιμόνιον τέρας ἀμφινοῶν
τότε, referring to the previous scene
(1. 278), is without the directness and
simplicity of these short anapaestic passages,
in which the chorus announce the

‘But not without
my saying what I said,' was this choice
made. Ismene would clear herself from
the imputation of merely shrinking from
the attempt through cowardice, or without
laying before her sister the grounds
of her own conduct, as she had done
supr. 49 ff. She also wishes to remind
Antigone of ll. 78, 99, which acquit her
of indifference towards the dead. But
Antigone only recalls the argument
against opposing those in power. Wolff

latter part of it. If the first part were

Antigone rejoins, You need not trouble

safe.</p></div>

been dead to all the joys of life, and am

than in any speech of Ismene. Then,
granting that τὸ σὸν λέχος, addressed
to Ismene, might mean 'The marriage
you prate of,' the words express a much
deeper feeling as addressed to Antigone.
Outwardly a mere expression of impatience,
they convey the only touch
of natural feeling which Creon betrays.
574 and 576 are then most naturally
given to the chorus. The act of Creon
in sacrificing his son's happiness is more
solemnly marked when his words are
addressed to the coryphaeus. While
adhering to this view I am bound to
add that some of the best critics
prefer the other arrangement of the

l. 484. This reading, although defaced

such would-be improvements as εὖ δὲ

εὖ δετὰς δὲ χρὴ | γυναῖκας εἶναι (Seyffert),

amongst other reasons, for destroying the
singleness of the emphasis. Creon, as
usual, covers his self-will under the appearance
of principle. Cp. Plat. Legg.

The words indicate that Antigone's
going beyond the gate, supr. 18, 19, was
an exceptional freedom, consequent on
the war. Thus Sophocles is contented
with a hint, where Euripides thinks an
explanation necessary: Phoen. 89-91.

But see Essay on L. pp. 92, 93.
The grotesque image of Death, or
Hades, armed with a bloody chopper
or cleaver, however agreeable to the
manner of Euripides, or some other
poets, has no parallel in the language
of Sophocles. And the transition from
this concrete imagery to the spirits of
fury and madness is, to say the least,
awkwardly abrupt. The words λόγου
τ᾽ ἄνοια καὶ φρενῶν Ἐρινύς are most
natural if they are added to expand an
obscure allusion to the deed which had
brought Antigone into danger. And
the words φοινία θεῶν τῶν νερτέρων ..
κόνις, 'The deadly dust sacred to the
gods below,' convey such an allusion
not more obscurely than do the words
in Tr. 836 ff., δεινοτάτῳ μὲν ὕδρας
προστετακὼς φάσματι, κ.τ.λ., express the
condition of Heracles in the poisoned
robe. Triclinius was therefore not absurd
in saying εἰκότως δὲ τὸ κόνις τέ-
θειται. διότι γὰρ ἐκάλυψεν Ἀντιγόνη

606. Not slumber that brings age to

Sleep says, ἄλλον μέν κεν ἔγωγε θεῶν αἰει-

the simplest change which avoids a

the loss of a syllable after θεῶν,

of this use obviates the objection of
Schneidewin, that the months of the Gods
are opposed to Zeus, who is generally
the orderer of time, as in Hom. Il. 2.

The modern poet
speaks of love as 'engendered in the
eyes, with gazing fed:' the ancients
rather spoke of an influence passing
from the eye of the beloved (τὸ ἐρωτι-
κὸν ὄμμα, Plat. Phaedr. 253 E) to the
soul of the lover. Desire was viewed
as an emanation from the object. Hence
Plato's account of ἵμερος, Phaedr. 251
Β, C, δεξάμενος γὰρ τοῦ κάλλους τὴν
ἀπορροὴν διὰ τῶν ὀμμάτων, ἐθερμάνθη ἢ
ἡ τοῦ πτεροῦ φύσις ἄρδεται .. ὅταν μὲν

ἵμερος καλεῖται, δεχομένη ἄρδηταί τε καὶ
θερμαίνηται, λωφᾷ τε τῆς ὀδύνης καὶ γέ-
γηθεν. This ancient conception, which
had a root in language as well as in
philosophy, is reflected even in Milton,
L'Allegro, 1. 121, 'With store of ladies,
whose bright eyes | Rain influence,'
though in this case probably with a
further allusion to astrology.

There is an allusion to Haemon, who,

The conjectural

snow. On the general sense thus given
to ὄμβρος, see Essay on L. § 52. p. 98.

Essay on L. p. 105.
857. Thou hast touched my saddest
thought, the thrice-told tale of my
father's sorrow.' Boeckh has cleared
up the difficulties of this passage (1) by
showing that οἶκτον harmonizes better
with the context than οἶτον or οἶκον, and
also gives a construction to πότμου:
(2) by tracing the derivation of τρι-
πόλιστον from πολίζω = πολέω, which
occurs in the compound avναπολίζω :
(3) by rightly explaining the dative
Λαβδακίδαισιν. See E. on L. § 13. p. 19.
He also points out that μερίμνας is
genitive, because the singular is more
forcible, and μέριμναν would have suited
the metre equally well. The only remaining
doubt is the construction of οἶκτον.
ψαύειν may govern the accusative, as
appears from 961. But the change
from the genitive to the accusative is
still to be accounted for. (1) The word
ἔψαυσας was chosen with special reference
to μερίμνας. ἔλεξας, or some
other general word, would have been
sufficient if this had not intervened.
Hence the general meaning of the verb
(= ἔλεξας) is alone continued. (2) The
case is partly governed by the verbal
notion in μερίμνας = 8 μεριμνῶ. (3) The
tendency of a Greek sentence is to pass
from a more special to a more general
construction. Essay on L. pp. 64, 5,
οἶκτον is to be resumed with πότμου, which
is co-ordinate with πατρός. Thou

general fortune of our race, the lot that
fell upon the famed Labdacidae.' Seyffert
thinks that in τριπόλιστον Antigone
is thinking of her own ever-deepening
grief. But the Scholiast and Boeckh
are probably right in explaining the
word (like κλεινοῖς) with reference to
the widely felt compassion for Oedipus.
Cp. O. C. 517, τό τοι πολὺ καὶ μηδαμὰ
λῆγον: ib. 597, πᾶς τοῦτό γ' Ἑλλήνων
θροεῖ. For τριπόλιστον, cp. Phil. 1238,
δὶς ταὐτὰ βούλει καὶ τρὶς ἀναπολεῖν μ'
ἔπη.
861. κλεινοῖς is said with bitterness,
as in O. T. 1207, κλεινὸν Οἰδίπου κάρα.
The dative is used in explanation of
ἁμετέρου, Ist as clearer than the genitive
with so many genitives preceding;
2nd with an ethical' force; 'the lot
that fell on us.'
863. O my mother, to whom marriage
was calamity, O my hapless
father, who in wedlock with a mother,
held guilty intercourse with her from
whom he came.'
ματρῷαι λέκτρων ἆται] ‘My mother's
calamity in marriage.' λέκτρων is descriptive
or distinctive genitive (Essay
on L. § 9. p. 12), and the possessive
ματρῷαι is joined to λέκτρων ἆται taken
as one word. In observing Antigone's
tenderness for her mother we are reminded
that the plot of the Oedipus
Tyrannus was not yet conceived.
865. ματρός is objective genitive,
after κοιμήματα = ξυνουσίαι, and also
descriptive, like γάμοι τέκνων, Ο. C.
945. For the condensed expression

see E. on L. § 43. p. 81, and for the force
of αὐτός in composition, ibid. p. 101.
The dative ἐμῷ πατρί (Ε. on L. § 13.
p. 19, see on 1. 861) is occasioned by
the adjective; i. e. αὐτογέννητ᾽ ἦν αὐτῷ
τὰ κοιμήματα. The nature of constructions
in such condensed expressions can
only be explained by expanding each
phrase into a sentence. The meaning
of the passive verbal termination in
αὐτογέννητα is extremely indefinite.
The other way of taking the words
('Connubium dicit Jocastae cum Oedipo
quem ipsa pepererat,' Dind.), although
giving a more obvious construction to
the dative, has the fatal blemish of
making a twofold apostrophe to Jocasta,
whereas οἵων implies a reference
to both parents, which is much more
forcible.
The Laur. reading δυσμόρῳ is preferable,
because of the peculiar significance
of κοιμήματα ματρός.
866. οἴων is to be immediately referred
to κοιμήματα, <gloss>Such wedlock as

868. μέτοικος may possibly have the
association of an alien,' because she

ἀνάσσεται, where there is a similar
ellipse of the antecedent. The meaning

This must be
addressed to Polynices, who is most in
the thoughts of the spectators, and is
again invoked in the same words in
1.915: not to Eteocles, of whose burial
Antigone only knew by hearsay, supr.
23 ff. The difficulty of reconciling this
with the following lines has been adduced
as one of several reasons for rejecting
the passage from 1. 900 to 1. 928
in whole or in part. The lines 905-12
are apt to appear to modern readers, as
they did to Goethe, a blemish in a
place which might have been expected
to be most carefully finished. The
saying, which Herodotus, 3. 119, attributes
almost in the same terms to the
wife of Intaphernes, would seem from
this to have had a wide currency in
Ionia-for it is a precarious supposition
that either author derived it from the
other-and fell in with the natural tendency
of Greek life to exalt the bond of
brotherhood above all other ties of affection
and kindred. The general feeling
of the speech is well traced by
Seyffert. Antigone, when brought face
to face with death, in utter isolation
from human sympathy, comes down
from the lofty tone she had assumed in
her first answer to Creon, and recognizes
the simple fact that it was the
strength of her affection which impelled
her to defy the law. Her love for Poly-

nices was wonderful, passing the love
that could be felt for a husband or a
child. She dilates on this and justifies
it by a primitive sophism, which the
passage of Herodotus cited above shows
to be more in the spirit of the time of
Sophocles or of the age preceding him
than of any later period. If the Antigone
is the earliest of the seven plays
(see Introduction), we need not be surprised
by an archaism of thought which
is much less remarkable than several
which occur in Aeschylus. In an early
English ballad, called the Douglas
Tragedy, a woman interceding for the
life of her father, whom her lover would
slay, gives the following reason :-'True
lovers I can get many a one, | But a
father I'll never get more.'</p></div>

of her father and mother. The libation

The
suddenness of these transitions is very
expressive of the agitation of Antigone's
mind. Her fate leads her even to doubt
the providence of the gods, but not to
admit that she has done wrong. She
will make the admission when death
has taught it her, but not before. If

This
has actually been interpreted as a prayer
of Antigone for her enemies. Others
explain it as a warning to them 'Let
them see to it that they do not suffer
more.' The real meaning is, that she
cannot imprecate heavier sufferings on
them than they are inflicting on her.

To translate this 'Mayest thou not
perish yet,' would be a similar mistake
to that which has caused the difficulty
about the present passage. It is true,

throughout only thought of as a foil for

in Antigone speaking of herself

The chorus, in the manner
of Pindar, moralise on the fate of Antigone
through examples drawn from the
circle of mythology and legend; and
thus suggest the same cold comfort as
in their mention of Niobe. The effect
of this ode is to repress the excitement
and solemnize the thoughts of the
spectator.
'Danaë, though of royal lineage, and
entrusted with the golden shower, was
bound by all-constraining destiny in her
brazen cell.
'Bound, too, in a prison of rock, was
Lycurgus, who provoked the God. He
knew his madness when it was too late.
'And on the Thracian promontory
Phineus' sons, blinded by their father's
wife (Idothea), bewailed their rejected
mother Cleopatra's hapless lot, who,
descended from an ancient line, and endowed
with swiftness by her divine sire,
was notwithstanding overtaken by the
long-lived fates.'
Danae and Cleopatra were, like Antigone,
of royal birth, and, like Antigone,
were bound in a living tomb. So also
was the son of Dryas, himself a king:
and this, in his case, was the penalty of
an impetuous and defiant spirit.
Sophocles seems to have followed
one version of the obscure and variable
legend of Phineus, according to which
Cleopatra did not die, but was rejected
by Phineus for Idothea, and imprisoned
in a cave, from which she was afterwards
released by Heracles. The sons
were blinded by their step-mother.
The first strophe and antistrophe are
choriambic with an iambic close; the
second, logaoedic. The choriambi here
were probably chanted slowly, so as to
have a weighty, solemn effect. The
scheme is as follows:

Antigone is apostrophized
after her departure, like Oedipus in
Ο. C. 1567, πάλιν σε δαίμων δίκαιος
αὔξοι.
988, foll. The coming of Teiresias is
the beginning of the περιπέτεια, ‘The
change in the spirit' of Creon's 'dream.'
The external marks of the prophet are
noticed more prominently than in the
Oedipus Tyrannus. Cp. especially 998-
90, with O. T. 371, τυφλὸς τὰ τ᾽ ὦτα,
κ.τ.λ., and 444, καὶ σύ, παῖ, κόμιζέ με:
992-95, with Ο. Τ. 436, γονεῦσι δ', οἵ
σ᾽ ἔφυσαν, ἔμφρονες. The figure of the
blind prophet is more ideal in the Oedipus
Tyrannus, and the peculiarity of his
position is brought out, in a higher
mode of art, with one or two light
touches. On the other hand, his sudden
and unlooked-for coming suits exactly
with the purpose of this drama and the
person of Creon.

ing of the preposition is not to be
pressed. It is merely an extension of
the familiar metaphor of γένος, ‘Kind'
for Class.' Cobet conj. τὸ δέ γε τυ-

tribrach in the first place, so unlike the
earlier manner of Sophocles, the expression
is less forcible. It is like the
difference between saying 'the class of
tyrants' and 'the breed of tyrants' in
English. Cp. Eur. Hec. 254, 5, ἀχάρι-

assumed, although not mentioned elsewhere
in the play, that the bodies of
the allies of Polynices had shared his
fate, as there had been no truce for
burying the dead. This is part of the
legend as appears from the Supplices of
Euripides. For the expression, cp.
Aesch. S. c. T. 1020, οὕτω πετηνῶν τόνδ'

ἔμψυχοι τάφοι: Shaksp. Macbeth, 3. 4,
Our monuments | Shall be the maws

the Elizabethan dramatists. Seyffert's
conjecture, ὅσαν τὰ πράγματ' ἢ κύνες
καθήγνισαν, 'Whose business has been
marred with pollution by dogs,' etc., is
rather pointless, and gives a very doubtful
meaning to καθαγνίζειν = 'To affect
with pollution.' It is uncertain whether
καθήγνισαν or καθήγισαν is the right
word. The latter is somewhat more
probable as the Ionic form. Cp. ἁγίζω.

Boeckh objects to the above interpretation

them to contain a general maxim pointed
at the case of Thebes. 'Any state
is sure to rise in enmity in which a
mangled corse has been devoured,' etc.

you provoke me, arrows that pierce the

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="1115"><p>In the excitement of a desperate
hope caused by the late repentance of
Creon, the chorus break forth into a
joyous invocation to Dionysus, accompanied
with dancing or gesticulation,
as appears in comparing the similar
canticle in Aj. 693, where the chorus
are under the excitement of a similar
delusive expectation. Cp. Tr. 205-24.
The Dionysiac worship, of which the
tragic poet is a votary, is associated
with the mystic hopes which Creon
denied, supr. 780.
Glory of Semele, child of Zeus,
Thou that tendest Campania And rulest
in Eleusis' mystic vale, Dwelling, where
thy votaries dwell, In Thebes by Ismenus'
waters, Presiding o'er the dragon's
brood: Seen o'er the forked height By the
pitchy flame, Where move the Bacchic
nymphs of Corycus, Where is the Castalian
fount: And ushered on thy way
To visit Thebe's roads By the ivy-clad
banks of Nysean mountains, And the
bloomy shore with many a cluster,
While the shout of the immortal strain
resounds. Thebè thou honourest far
above all cities, Thou and thy mother
whom the lightning glorified. And now
that our whole multitude Is overtaken
by misfortune dire, Appear with healing
tread, Over the Parnassian steep Or
groaning narrow sea. Thou that leadest
up the dance of the fire-breathing
stars, Visitant of nightly voices, Son
born of Zeus, Rise with thy attendant
Maenads, Who, all night long. Celebrate
thee with dances, Iacchus, the dispenser
of their joys.'
This ode has been variously arranged.

Bacchus is lord and leader of the sights

the 'voices of the night' are

There is a
change from the participial construction

subject of ἦν, and the finite verb εὔθυνε
is substituted for εὐθύνων. This is more
in accordance with the 'growing' nature
of the language of Sophocles, than to
suppose, with Seyffert, that σώσας begins
a new sentence in apposition to, and
epexegetic of, the previous clause.

Cp. supr. 578, and note. On the change
from plural to singular, see Essay on L.
§20. p. 31. And on the inversion (ἡδο-
νὰς προδῶσιν ἄνδρες = ἡδοναὶ προδῶσιν
ἄνδρας), ibid. § 42. p. 80, β. In favour
of the reading of the MSS. it must be
admitted that the plural ἄνδρες, in this
pronominal sense, is unusual.
The meaning of the MS. reading is,
'A man's pleasures, when they have

This is the
first hand of L, and the words are so
quoted by Athenaeus according to
some MSS. I have always felt that
the transition to the second person
imperative (which has been suggested
by εἰ βούλει) was somewhat harsh.
The present indicative is sometimes
used in putting a hypothetical case:
(Plat. Theaet. 192 Ε, Σωκράτης ἐπι-
γιγνώσκει Θεόδωρον καὶ Θεαίτητον,
ὁρᾷ δὲ μηδέτερον. So the aor. indicative
in Hdt. 7. 10, καὶ δὴ καὶ συνήνεικε
ἤτοι κατὰ γῆν ἢ καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν
ἑσσωθῆναι, κ.τ.λ.) And the conversational
use of εἰ βούλει (which assists
the expression) is too familiar to need
illustration. See L. and S. s. v. βού-

The intervention of the Exangelus at

special features, which must have made
this commos extraordinarily impressive.

1262. στερεά may be explained, either
with Dindorf, (1) 'Propter duram et

by hypallage for στερεῶν φρενῶν

speaks of στερεαὶ ὀδυναί, = * Hard to endure.'

quite well be used proleptically = σκο-

deep cavern where it lay. Eurydice may
speak of this as at once her son's grave

κλεινόν, because earning him his country's

i. e. <gloss>Whether

words that follow are suggested by the
general notion of distraction which is
here expressed. The words in L etc.
παῖ καὶ θῶ (= 'Which way also I shall
order them'), are clearly a corruption
of πᾷ κλιθῶ, which, however, was probably
a gloss. For if πάντα γάρ is
dropped instead, the asyndeton of λέ-
χρια, κ.τ.λ., is very harsh.

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="6">
<p><lem>* πάντα γὰρ.. εἰσήλατο</lem>
‘For
all that I am engaged with is ready to
fall, while from above a destiny hard
to be borne has leapt upon my head.'
The opposition is not between Haemon
and Eurydice (Dindorf), nor between
present and future (Seyffert), but between
the visible circumstances and the
invisible hand of fate. λέχριος is used
metaphorically. (See Essay on L. p.
105.) Creon cannot bear the misery
that surrounds him, and he cannot look
up because of the heavy weight of
destiny impending over him.
