<head>TRANSLATED BY GEORGE CHAPMAN.</head>
<l n="1">THE reverend, rich-crown'd, and fair queen, I sing,</l>
<l n="2">Venus, that owns in fate the fortressing</l>
<l n="3">Of all maritimal Cyprus; where the force</l>
<l n="4">Of gentle-breathing Zephyr steer'd her course</l>
<l n="5">Along the waves of the resounding sea;</l>
<l n="6">While, yet unborn, in that soft foam she lay</l>
<l n="7">That brought her forth. Whom those fair Hours, that bear</l>
<l n="8">The golden bridles, joyfully stood near,</l>
<l n="9">Took up into their arms, and put on her</l>
<l n="10">Weeds of a never-corruptible wear.</l>
<l n="11">On her immortal head a crown they plac'd,</l>
<l n="12">Elaborate, and with all the beauties grac'd</l>
<l n="13">That gold could give it: of a weight so great,</l>
<l n="14">That, to impose and take off, it had set</l>
<l n="15">Three handles on it, made for endless hold,</l>
<l n="16">Of shining brass, and all adorn'd with gold.</l>
<l n="17">Her soft neck all with carcanets was grac'd,</l>
<l n="18">That stoop'd and both her silver breasts embrac'd,</l>
<l n="19">Which even the hours themselves wear in resort</l>
<l n="20">To deities' dances, and her father's court.</l>
<l n="21">Grac'd at all parts, they brought to heaven her graces,</l>
<l n="22">Whose first sight seen, all fell into embraces;</l>
<l n="23">Hugg'd her white hands, saluted, wishing all</l>
<l n="24">To wear her maiden flow'r in festival</l>
<l n="25">Of sacred Hymen, and to lead her home.</l>
<l n="26">All, to all admiration, overcome</l>
<l n="27">With Cytherea with the violet crown.</l>
<l n="28">So to the black-brow'd-sweet-spoke all renown;</l>
