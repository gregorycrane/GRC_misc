You will be provided with two files:

A TEI XML file containing transcribed text.

A raw OCR text file of the same book, which should be used as the source of truth.

Your task is to compare the two files and generate a concise report of all discrepancies found in the XML file. Do not output a corrected version of the full XML file.

Your report should be structured in two parts:

1. Textual Discrepancies:
For each direct textual error, create a list item with the following information:

Line Number: The line number from the n attribute in the XML file (e.g., Line 3).

XML Version: The incorrect text as it appears in the XML file.

OCR Version: The correct text as it appears in the raw OCR file.

2. Structural and Markup Discrepancies:
In a separate list, describe any errors related to the XML structure or markup. Examples include:

Incorrect line numbering in attributes.

Spurious tags (e.g., <gap/> or <del/> tags that are not justified by the source text).

Incorrect speaker attributions.

Lines of verse that are improperly split across multiple tags.

The final output should only be this two-part report.
