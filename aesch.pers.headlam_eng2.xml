<stage><p>Scene: The palace of Xerxes at Susa.</p>
<p>Time: The forenoon after the nocturnal vision of Atossa (v. 182 sqq.).</p>
<p>The Chorus, assembled in front of the palace (v. 144), give voice to their anxiety concerning the fate of the armada sent against Greece.</p></stage>
</ab>
<sp><speaker start-line="1" end-line="161">CHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS</speaker><p>Behold in us the 'Trusty' remnant—as our name declares—of the Persians who are gone to the land of Hellas, and guardians of the opulent palace rich in gold; whom king Xerxes, prince of Dareios' line, did himself select for our ripe years to watch over his country.</p>
<p>Now as to the return of our king and of his army rich in gold, my soul within me is at this present time disturbed, <lb n="10"/> presaging disaster. For all the strength of the Asian nation is gone abroad, and murmurs at having a new king,<ref n="41.1">1</ref> and neither any messenger nor any horseman arrives at the city of the Persians who left Susa and went forth, and Ecbatana, and the ancient Cissian stronghold, some on horseback, some on shipboard, or as infantry forming close ranks <lb n="20"/> of war.</p>
<note type="footnote" n="41.1">1 v. 784. Cf. also vv. 746 and 854 sqq.</note>

<pb n="42"/>
<p>Amistres, for instance, and Artaphrenes speed forth, and Megabates and Astaspes, Persian leaders; kings subject to the Great King, overseers of a mighty host, masters of the bow and steed, terrible to look on and deadly in combat, in full confidence of spirit.<ref n="42.1">1</ref> Artembares too, who delights in horsemanship, and Masistres, and doughty Imæus, <lb n="30"/> master of the bow, and Pharandakes, and Sosthanes driver of steeds. Others did the great and fertilising river Nile send forth; Susiskanes was there, Pegastagon of Egyptian family, and the prince of sacred Memphis, mighty Arsames, and Ariomardos, governor of ancient Thebes; and inhabitants of a marshy region-rowers of ships-skilful, and in <lb n="40"/> multitude innumerable. And a crowd of soft-living Lydians, who keep in subjection a nation entirely land-faring, goes with them, whom Metrogathes and valiant Arcteus, ruling princes, and Sardis rich in gold send out, borne in many chariots, in two-shafted ranks and in three-shafted ranks, a sight terrible to see. Set too are the borderers on sacred Tmolus on casting the yoke of servitude about Hellas,— <lb n="50"/> Mardon, Tharybis, anvils of the spear, and men of Mysia whose weapon is the javelin. Babylon too, the rich in gold, sends a mixed multitude in long array, some carried on ships, some trusting in their courage to draw the bow. And the scimitar-armed peoples of all Asia go with them, under the dread mandates of the king. So fair a flower of men of the Persian land is gone from it, in respect of whom <lb n="60"/> all the country of Asia which reared them is constrained with vehement longing; and parents and wives, as they count the days, tremble at the lengthening out of time.</p>
<note type="footnote" n="42.1">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτλήμονι</foreign> (which some MSS. have). Cf. <cit><bibl>Simonides ep. 40</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">εὐτόλμῳ ψυχῆς λήματι πειθόμενοι</quote></cit>.</note>
<p>The army of the king, which makes havoc of cities, by now has passed to the neighbouring land beyond the narrow sea, having crossed the strait of Helle daughter of Athamas
<pb n="43"/>
on a cable-fastened pontoon-bridge, by casting a riveted <lb n="70"/> causeway as a yoke upon the neck of Ocean.</p>
<p>Against a whole continent does the fiery leader of populous Asia direct his wondrous flock of men, in two divisions, with land-forces and on sea, putting his trust in his stalwart sturdy commanders—a being like unto the gods, of a race sprung <lb n="80"/> from gold.</p>
<p>And flashing from his eyes the dark glance of a deadly python, with many a warrior and many a sailor, and urging forward his Syrian chariot, he is bringing against a people famous for the spear a nation in arms whose pride is the bow.</p>
<p>There is no one of such proved puissance as to withstand the mighty torrent of men, and with secure defences <lb n="90"/> keep back the resistless tide; for the Persian army cannot be faced, and stout-hearted are their people.</p>
<p>But the beguiling Illusion of a god what mortal man shall escape? Who is he that with agile foot is master of an easy leap [over the net]?</p>
<p>Aye, for fawning at first upon him, as though with kind intent,<ref n="43.1">1</ref> it leads a man astray into the toils of Calamity, <lb n="100"/> whence it is not possible for a mortal to escape and flee.</p>
<note type="footnote" n="43.1">1 Cf. <bibl><title>Agam.</title> 726 and 1227</bibl>. So <cit><bibl>Plutarch <title>Them.</title> 29</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ . . . προσειπὼν φιλοφρόνως</quote></cit> ('with an appearance of cordiality').</note>
<p>For by the gods' will since long ago Fate has been dominant, and has laid it upon the Persians to pursue wars that demolish towers, and shocks of cavalry in action, and destructions of cities.</p>
<p>Also they learned, putting trust in the slight structure of tackling and in contrivances for carrying men [over the waters], to look upon the ocean plain of the broad sea when it whitens beneath the furious blast.</p>
<p>Therefore my soul, shrouded in gloom, is racked with dread (Ah! Ah!) for this Persian expedition, fearing lest <lb n="110"/>
<pb n="44"/>
the state may learn that the great city of the Susian district is made desolate of men, and the Cissians' town, as a crowd of women utter this cry Ah! Ah!, may echo back the strain, and lest rending may fall on linen garments.</p>
<p>For all the host, driving steeds or tramping over the <lb n="130"/> plain, is gone forth, like bees in a swarm, together with the captain-general of the expedition; having crossed over the projecting arm of the sea,<ref n="44.1">1</ref> now bridged over, which is common to both continents.</p>
<p>And by reason of yearning for absent warriors couches are filled with weeping; and Persian wives, indulging their grief,<ref n="44.2">2</ref> each one of them, having sent away [to the war] her gallant armed consort, is left solitary.</p>

<p>But come, Persians, let us seat ourselves beneath the shade of this ancient palace and take good counsel from the depths of thought (and need there is for it), as to how haply fares Xerxes our king of Dareios' line, of the race of [Perseus] our common ancestor—whether it is the drawing of the bow that conquers, or has the power of the pointed <lb n="150"/> spear the mastery? But here is hasting forth an effulgence like to the eyes of gods, the Mother of the King, my Queen; I prostrate myself before her. And fitting also is it that we all address her in words of salutation.</p>
<stage>(Enter ATOSSA in a chariot, see v. 610.)</stage>
<p>Queen supreme of Persia's deep-girt women, venerable mother of Xerxes, wife to Dareios, hail! Consort wert thou of the Persian's god; and mother art thou of a god—unless its ancient happy fortune is now departed from the host.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="162" end-line="175">ATOSSA</speaker><p>In just that fear did I leave the gold-appointed palace and the bridal-chamber which I shared with Dareios,
<pb n="45"/>
and now come hither. My thoughts are racking my heart; and to you, my friends, will I tell my tale, being by no means without misgiving about myself, in dread lest great Good Fortune,<ref n="45.1">1</ref> raising over the earth the dust [of a military advance], shall have overturned with its foot the [fabric of] Prosperity which Dareios reared not unaided by some god. Therefore is there a twofold anxious thought, inexpressible, in my mind-not to honour with reverence a mass of riches lacking men; and again, that light shines not equal to their strength on men lacking wealth. Our wealth, indeed, is <lb n="170"/> beyond cavil, but there is alarm concerning our eye—for I hold the master's presence to be the eye of the palace— wherefore, Persians, since these things are so, lend me, ye aged Trusty ones, your counsel. For in my case all sound resolutions are dependent upon you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker start-line="176" end-line="178">CHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS</speaker><p>Be well assured, Queen of this land, not twice hast thou to indicate either word or deed [to us] respecting matters in which Power is wont to lead the way; for loyal to thy interests are we whom thou summonest as counsellors in these affairs.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="179" end-line="217">ATOSSA</speaker><p>By many a dream in the night-time have I been haunted ever since my son, having fitted out an armada, <lb n="180"/> went hence with design to ravage the Ionians' land. But never saw I aught so clear as in the night just passed—and I will tell it to thee. There seemed to appear before me two women in fair attire, one apparelled in Persian raiment, the other in Dorian, the twain pre-eminent in stature beyond those living now, flawless in beauty, and sisters of the same family. The country they inhabited was in the case of one sister, Hellas—she having acquired it by lot—in the case of the other, barbarian soil. These twain, as I thought <lb n="190"/>
<pb n="46"/>
I perceived, were pursuing a quarrel one with the other; and my son, having become aware of it, was seeking to check and to pacify them, and yokes the pair to a chariot and places harness over their necks. And one of them towered loftily in these trappings, and kept her mouth tractable in the reins; but the other began to plunge, and with her hands tears in pieces the harness of the chariot, and drags it furiously along with her, heeding not the bit, and snaps the yoke asunder. Then falls my son, and his <lb n="200"/> father Dareios stands beside commiserating him. And Xerxes, when he perceives him, rends his robes around his body.</p>
<p>These things I tell you I beheld in the night; but when I had arisen, and touched with my hands the fair waters of a spring, I took my station at an altar with incense in my hand, intending to offer a sacred mixture to the divinities who avert evil, for whom these ceremonies are proper. But I see an eagle fleeing for refuge to the altar of Phoebus, —and from terror I stood speechless, my friends,—and after that I see a hawk rushing with outstretched wings upon him, and with his talons plucking at his head; and <lb n="210"/> the eagle did nothing but cower down and yield his body. This was terrifying for me to see, and so it is for you to hear. For know ye well that my son, should he be successful, would be regarded with awe, and supposing he should not be successful,—he<ref n="46.1">1</ref> cannot be called to account by the state, and if he escapes alive, he is, in any event, the ruler of this land.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker start-line="218" end-line="228">CHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS</speaker><p>We desire not, O Mother, either to alarm thee unduly by our words, or unduly to raise thy hopes; but if thou didst see anything sinister, thou shouldst supplicate <lb n="220"/> the gods with prayer, and beseech diversion of these evils,
<pb n="47"/>
and that all good things may be fulfilled for thyself and thy children and for the city and for all thy friends. And in the second place it is proper that thou pour a libation to the earth and to the dead; and in propitiatory wise do thou ask this boon of thy spouse Dareios, whom thou declarest thou didst see by night,—to send good things for thee and for thy son to the light of day from beneath the earth; and [ask that] the reverse of this, detained below the earth, may fade away in darkness. Thus I advise thee with kindly intent, guided only by the promptings of my mind. And our interpretation is that in all ways a good issue will be brought to pass for thee in this matter.</p></sp>

Nevertheless mortals must endure afflictions when the gods award them. Do thou compose thyself, and, unfolding all that happened, even though thou groanest at the evil of it, speak out. Who is there that is not dead? Whom, of the leaders of the host, are we to bewail as having been appointed to

And the chiliarch Dadakes beneath the shock of a spear leapt with a light spring overboard. Tenagon, too, the true-born chieftain of the Bactrians, is moving to and fro about the surf-beaten isle of Aias. Lilaios and Arsames and, thirdly, <lb n="310"/> Argéstes, around the dove-breeding island keep butting, these three, helplessly against the unyielding shore. Arcteus too, whose dwelling is nigh unto the waters of Egyptian Nile, Adeues, and, thirdly, †Phreseues,† Pharnuchos, these fell from one vessel. Matallos of Chrysa, commander of ten thousand, leader of thirty thousand black cavalry, soaked in death his thick and bushy auburn beard, <lb n="320"/> changing its colour with a staining of dark purple. And Magian Arabos perished there, and Artabes the Bactrian, a settler now in a rugged land. Amistris, and Amphistreus wielder of an active spear, and gallant Ariomardos—a cause of grief [by his death] to Sardis—and Sisames the Mysian, and Tharybis of Lyrnaian race, commander of five times fifty ships, a warrior of goodly presence, lies dead, unhappy man, in sorely wretched case. And a Syennesis, foremost in courage, governor of the Cilicians, fell gloriously, after giving more trouble to the foe than any other one man. Of such among our leaders have I now made mention.

the number of the Greek vessels that they ventured to join battle with the Persian armament by charging with their ships'-beaks upon it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="340" end-line="350">MESSENGER</speaker><p>As to numbers, be well assured that the bar-<lb n="340"/>barians<ref n="51.1">1</ref> had the advantage in ships; for on the Greek side the whole numbers came to three divisions of thirty vessels, and there was besides these a select division of ten. But Xerxes had, for I know, a thousand in number of which he was commander, and those [besides] of superior class in speed were two hundred and seven; this is the tale of them. You do not think us the inferior force in this engagement? No, it was some divinity that destroyed the host, having depressed the scales of fortune with a weight against our side. The gods keep safe the city of their goddess Pallas.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker start-line="351" end-line="351">ATOSSA</speaker><p>Then is Athens still unravaged?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="352" end-line="352">MESSENGER</speaker><p>Yes, for whilst her warriors live she has a sure <lb n="350"/> protection.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="353" end-line="355">ATOSSA</speaker><p>Now tell me what was the beginning of the naval encounter. Who were they who made the first move in the fight? The Greeks? Or my son, from a sense of exultation at the number of his ships?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="356" end-line="435">MESSENGER</speaker><p>Some fiend it was, O mistress, or evil spirit that appeared from somewhere, who began all the mischief. A Greek, who came from the Athenian host, told thy son Xerxes that if the darkness of black night should come the <lb n="360"/> Greeks would not stand fast, but, leaping on to the thwarts of their vessels, would, each taking his own direction, endeavour to save their lives by stealthy flight. And he, as soon as he heard this, not realising the wile of the Greek nor the jealousy of the gods, publishes to all the captains the following order—when the sun should have ceased to illumine the earth with his rays and darkness should have laid hold on the temple of the sky, then to draw up vessels
<pb n="52"/>
in close order arranged in three lines to guard the sea-exits <lb n="370"/> and the murmuring straits; and [to station] other vessels in a circle round about the isle of Aias; understanding that, if the Greeks shall escape an evil fate by finding some means of escape for their ships, without being discovered, it has been decreed that they shall all be deprived of their heads. Such were his words, prompted by much confidence of mind, since he knew not what was appointed by the gods to come to pass. And the Persian troops in orderly fashion and disciplined spirit set about preparing an evening meal, and each seaman saw to the lashing of his oar about the nicely fitted thole-pin. Then, when the light of the sun <lb n="380"/> had waned and night was coming on, every master of an oar went to his ship, and every master of weapons. And one line of warships kept cheering on another line and [the Persians] make sail even as each man had orders, and the livelong night ship-captains kept all the crews working their vessels backwards and forwards. But though night began to draw off, yet the Greek host made nowhere any kind of attempt at a stealthy escape. When, however, day with its white steeds, radiant to behold, had occupied all the earth, <lb n="390"/> first of all a cheer from the Greeks rang loudly like a chant of triumph, and shrill and clear from the island crags Echo returned the cry. And fear was in the hearts of all the barbarians, finding themselves mistaken; for the Greeks were then chanting a solemn pæan not as seeking to escape, but as advancing to battle with daring courage. Next a bugle with its call fired all their line to action, and at once with foaming dash of oars in unison they smote, to the <lb n="400"/> word of command, the resounding brine. And rapidly the whole of them came plain into view. The right wing in good order led on foremost, and after that their whole armament was coming on against us, and at the same time a mighty shout could be heard, "Sons of the Greeks,
<pb n="53"/>
advance! Deliver your country, deliver your children and your wives, the temples of your fathers' gods, the tombs of your ancestors. Now is the contest which decides all!"</p>
<p>And then a confused noise of Persian tongues met them from our line, and no longer was it a time for inaction, but <lb n="410"/> forthwith ship against ship struck its armoured prow. A Greek vessel commenced the charge, and breaks off the whole stern part of a Phoenician ship, and each [captain] then steered his bark against some other vessel. At first indeed the torrent of the Persian armament held its own. But since the multitude of our ships was crowded in the narrows, and they could give no assistance the one to the other but [on the contrary] were rammed by the brazen-pointed beaks of their friends, they splintered their whole equipment of oars,—the Greek ships, too, all around them <lb n="420"/> noting their opportunity, kept charging them on every side, —and the hulls of our vessels began to be capsized nor was the sea any longer visible, so choked was it with wrecks and slaughtered men; and the shores and the reefs were full of them. Then in rout and confusion every ship, as many as there were of the barbarian armament, sought to row away. But the Greeks kept striking and hewing, as though we were tunnies or some draught of fish, with fragments of broken oars and splinters of wreckage; and cries of anguish filled the open sea with shrieks, until the appearance <lb n="430"/> of dark night broke off [the combat].

<p>No, their abiding-place is where Asopus waters the plain with his streams—a kindly nourishment for the Bœotians' land: where the height of disaster is in store for them to suffer as retribution for their pride and impious spirit, in that when they came to Hellas they made no scruple to <lb n="810"/> despoil the statues of the gods, nor to burn temples. Altars have been demolished, and shrines of divinities are overthrown from their foundations in heaps of ruin. Therefore, for the evil they did, an equal measure do they endure, and more will they in the future, nor yet is the bottom reached of [their fountain of] misfortunes,<ref n="66.1">1</ref> but it still is gushing forth. For so great shall be the mass of clotted gore in the Platæans' land beneath the Dorian spear, that heaps of dead shall bear witness even to the third generation that one who is mortal should not entertain <lb n="820"/> thoughts too high for him: for Presumption when it blossoms forth bears as fruit a crop of Calamity, whence it reaps a harvest of tears.</p>

And, outside the estuary, the cities on the mainland fortified round about by towers owned him as king, and the cities, too, which are proud [to be] round about the strait of Helle; and embayed Propontis, and the [Thracian] outlet of Pontus;</p>
<p>The sea-washed islands, too, off the projecting arm of <lb n="880"/> the sea, lying near this land: Lesbos, for instance, and olive-growing Samos, Chios and Paros, Naxos, Myconos, and Andros, adjoining Tenedos as a near neighbour;</p>
<p>And of the sea-girt islands mid-way between the con-tinents was he lord, Lemnos, and the settlement of Icaros, and Rhodes, and Cnidos; and Aphrodite's cities Paphos <lb n="890"/> and Soli; and Salamis, whose mother-city is the cause of our present moans.</p>
<p>Also the wealthy populous cities in the Ionian district <lb n="900"/> did he control by his prudent mind. And there was a tireless strength of armed warriors and of allies from every nation ready at hand.
