          <p>PROMETHEUS having, by his attention to the wants of men, provoked the anger of Jove, is bound down, in a cleft of a rock in a distant desert of Scythia. Here he not only relates the wanderings, but foretells the future lot of Io, and likewise alludes to the fall of Jove's dynasty. Disdaining to explain his meaning to Mercury, he is swept into the abyss amidst terrific hurricane and earthquake.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="1.1">1 Lucian, in his dialogue entitled <title>Prometheus</title>, or <title>Caucasus</title>, has given occasional imitations of passages in this play, not, however, sufficient to amount to a paraphrase, as Dr. Blomfield asserted. Besides, as Lucian lays the scene at Caucasus, he would rather seem to have had the <title>Prometheus solitus</title> in mind. (See <bibl>Schutz, Argum.</bibl>) But the ancients commonly made Caucasus the seat of the punishment of Prometheus, and, as Aeschylus is not over particular in his geography, it is possible that he may be not altogether consistent with himself. Lucian makes no mention of Strength and Force, but brings in Mercury at the beginning of the dialogue. Moreover, Mercury is represented in an excellent humour, and rallies Prometheus good-naturedly upon his tortures. Thus § 6, he says, <quote xml:lang="grc">εὖ ἔχει. καταπτήσεται ἤδη καὶ ὁ ἀετὸς ἀποκερω̃ν τὸ ἦπαρ, ὡς πάντα ἔχοις ἀντὶ τη̃ς καλη̃ς και εὐμηχάνου πλαστικῆς.</quote> In regard to the place where Prometheus was bound, the scene doubtless represented a ravine between two precipices rent from each other, with a distant prospect of some of the places mentioned in the wanderings of Io. (<quote xml:lang="lat">See Schutz, ibid.</quote>) But as the whole mention of Scythia is an anachronism, the less said on this point the better. Compare, however, the following remarks of Humboldt, Cosmos, vol. ii. p. 140, "The legend of Prometheus, and the unbinding the chains of the fire-bringing Titan on the Caucasus by Hercules in journeying eastward—the ascent of Io from the valley of the Hybrites—[See Griffiths' note on v. 717, on <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>ὑβριστὴς ποταμὸς</l>,</quote> which must be a proper name.]—towards the Caucasus; and the myth of Phryxus and Helle,—all point to the same path on which Phoenician navigators had earlier adventured."</note>

Vulcan, it behoves thee that the mandates, which thy Sire imposed, be thy concern,—to bind this daring wretch<ref n="2.2"/> to the lofty-cragged rocks, in fetters of adamantine chains that cannot be broken.

As soon as he had established himself on his father's throne, he assigns forthwith to the different divinities each his honours, and he was marshalling in order his empire: but of woe-begone mortals he made no account, but wished, after having annihilated the entire race, to plant another new one.

And surmounting its peaks that neighbour on the stars, thou must go into a southward track, where thou wilt come to the man-detesting host of Amazons, who hereafter shall make a settlement, Themiscyra, on the banks of Thermodon, where lies the rugged Salmydessian sea-gorge, a host by mariners hated, a step-dame to ships; and they will conduct thee on thy way, and that right willingly. Thou shalt come too to the Cimmerian ithsmus, hard by the very portals of a lake, with narrow passage, which thou undauntedly must leave, and cross the Maeotie frith; and there shall exist for evermore among mortals a famous legend concerning thy passage, and after thy name it shall be called the Bosphorus; and after having quitted European ground, thou shalt come to the Asiatic continent. Does not then the sovereign of the gods seem to you to be violent alike towards all things? for he a god lusting to enjoy the charms of this mortal fair one, bath cast upon her these wanderings. And a bitter wooer, maiden, hast thou found for thy hand; for think that the words which thou hast now heard are not even for a prelude.</p>
