<p n="3" start-line="1.1" end-line="1.10" rend="no-indent">That man, tell me O Muse the
song of that man, that versatile [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">polu-tropos</foreign>] man, who in
very many ways <seg rend="subscript"
>2</seg> veered from his path and wandered off far
and wide, after he had destroyed the sacred
citadel of Troy. <seg rend="subscript"
>3</seg> Many different cities of many different
people did he see, getting to know different ways
of thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>4</seg> Many were the pains [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">algea</foreign>] he suffered in
his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thūmos</foreign>] while crossing the sea [5]
struggling to merit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>arnusthai</foreign>] the saving of his own life
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] and
his own homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] as well as the homecoming of
his comrades [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hetairoi</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>6</seg> But do what he might he could not save
his comrades [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hetairoi</foreign>], even though he very much
wanted to. <seg rend="subscript">7</seg> For they
perished through their own deeds of sheer
recklessness, <seg rend="subscript"
>8</seg>disconnected [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nēpioi</foreign>] as they were, because of what
they did to the cattle of the sun-god Helios. <seg
rend="subscript">9</seg> They ate them. So the god
[Helios] deprived them of their day of homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostimon</foreign>].
[10] Starting from any single point of departure,
O goddess, daughter of Zeus, tell me, as you have
told those who came before me.</p>
<p n="4" start-line="1.11" end-line="1.21"><seg rend="subscript">11</seg> So now all those
who escaped precipitous death <seg
rend="subscript">12</seg> were safely home, having
survived the war and the sea voyage. <seg
rend="subscript">13</seg> But he [= Odysseus],
apart from the others, though he was longing for
his homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] and for his wife, <seg
rend="subscript">14</seg> was detained by the
queenly nymph [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>numphē</foreign>] Kalypsō, who has her own
luminous place among all the goddesses [15] who
had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry
him. But as years went by, there came a time when
the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;
even then, however, when he was among his own
people, his trials [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthloi</foreign>] were not yet over; nevertheless
all the gods had now begun to pity him [20] except
Poseidon, who still persecuted godlike Odysseus
without ceasing and would not let him get
home.</p>
<p n="5" start-line="1.22" end-line="1.31">Now Poseidon had gone off to <seg
rend="subscript">23</seg> the Ethiopians, who are
divided in two, the most remote of men: <seg
rend="subscript">24</seg> some where Hyperion
[Helios] sets, others where he rises. He had gone
there [25] to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen,
and was enjoying himself at his festival; but the
other gods met in the house of Olympian Zeus, and
the father of gods and men spoke first. At that
moment he was thinking of stately Aegisthus, [30]
who had been killed by Agamemnon’s far-famed son
Orestes; so he said to the other gods:</p>
<p n="6" start-line="1.32" end-line="1.43"><seg rend="subscript">32</seg> “Oh my, how
mortals hold us gods responsible [= <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aitioi</foreign>]! <seg
rend="subscript">33</seg> For they say that their
misfortunes come from us. But they get their
sufferings, <seg rend="subscript">34</seg> beyond
what is fated, by way of their own acts of
recklessness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>atasthaliai</foreign>]. [35] Look at Aegisthus;
he must needs make love to Agamemnon’s wife
unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he
knew it would be the death of him; for I sent
Hermes, the mighty watcher, to warn him not to do
either of these things, [40] inasmuch as Orestes
would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up
and wanted to return home. Hermes told him this in
all good will but he would not listen, and now he
has paid for everything in full.”</p>
<p n="7" start-line="1.44" end-line="1.62">Then owl-vision Athena said, [45] “Father, son
of Kronos, King of kings, it served Aegisthus
right, and so it would any one else who does as he
did; but Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it
is for high-spirited Odysseus that my heart
bleeds, when I think of [50] his sufferings in
that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man,
from all his friends. It is an island covered with
forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a
goddess lives there, daughter of the magician
Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean,
and carries the great columns that keep the sky
and earth asunder. [55] This daughter of Atlas has
got hold of poor unhappy Odysseus, and keeps
trying by every kind of blandishment to make him
forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and
thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the
smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, [60] take no
heed of this, and yet when Odysseus was at Troy
did he not propitiate you with many a burnt
sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so
angry with him?”</p>
<p n="8" start-line="1.63" end-line="1.79">And Zeus said, “My child, what are you talking
about? [65] How can I forget godlike Odysseus than
whom there is no more capable man on earth [in
regard to <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>], nor more liberal in his
offerings to the immortal gods that live in the
sky? Bear in mind, however, that earth-encircler
Poseidon is still furious with Odysseus for having
blinded an eye of Polyphemus, king of the
Cyclopes. [70] Polyphemus is son to Poseidon,
shaker of the earth, by the nymph Thoösa, daughter
to the sea-king Phorkys; therefore though he will
not [75] kill Odysseus outright, he torments him
by preventing him from his homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]. Still, let us
lay our heads together and see how we can help him
to return; Poseidon will then be pacified, for if
we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out
against us.”</p>
<p n="9" start-line="1.80" end-line="1.95">[80] And owl-vision Athena said, “Father, son
of Kronos, King of kings, if, then, the gods now
mean that Odysseus should get home, we should
first send Hermes, the guide, the slayer of Argos
[85] to the Ogygian island to tell lovely-haired
Kalypsō that we have made up our minds and that he
is to have his homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]. <seg
rend="subscript">88</seg> As for me, I will go
travel to Ithaca, going to his [= Odysseus’]
son <seg rend="subscript">89</seg> in order to
give him [= Telemachus] more encouragement and to
put power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>menos</foreign>] into his heart [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">phrenes</foreign>]. [90] He is to
summon the long-haired Achaeans for a meeting in
assembly, <seg rend="subscript">91</seg> and he is
to speak out to all the suitors [of his mother
Penelope], who persist in <seg rend="subscript"
>92</seg> slaughtering again and again any number
of his sheep and oxen. <seg rend="subscript"
>93</seg> And I will conduct him to Sparta and to
sandy Pylos, <seg rend="subscript">94</seg>and
thus he will learn the return [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of his dear
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>]
father, if by chance he [= Telemachus] hears it,
[95] and thus may genuine glory [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] possess him
throughout humankind.”</p>
<p n="10" start-line="1.96" end-line="1.112">So saying she bound on her glittering golden
sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like
the wind over land or sea; she grasped the
terrifying bronze-shod spear, [100] so stout and
sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks
of heroes who have displeased her, and down she
darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, and
then, right away, she was in the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
Ithaca, at the gateway of Odysseus’ house, [105]
disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the
Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand.
There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides
of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and
diverting their hearts [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thūmos</foreign>] with board games in front of
the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling
about to wait upon them, [110] some mixing wine
with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down
the tables with wet sponges and laying them out
again, and some cutting up great quantities of
meat.</p>
<p n="11" start-line="1.113" end-line="1.124">Godlike Telemachus saw her long before any one
else did. He was sitting moodily among the suitors
[115] thinking about his brave father, and how he
would send them fleeing out of the house, if he
were to come to his own again and be honored as in
days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them,
he caught sight of Athena and went straight to the
gate, for he was vexed [120] that a stranger
should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her
right hand in his own, and bade her give him her
spear. “Welcome,” said he, “to our house, and when
you have partaken of food you shall tell us what
you have come for.”</p>
<p n="12" start-line="1.125" end-line="1.135">[125] He led the way as he spoke, and Athena
followed him. When they were within he took her
spear and set it in the spear-stand against a
strong bearing-post along with the many other
spears of his unhappy father, patient-hearted
Odysseus [130] and he conducted her to a richly
decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of
damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,
and he set another seat near her for himself, away
from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed
while eating by their noise and insolence, [135]
and that he might ask her more freely about his
father.</p>
<p n="13" start-line="1.136" end-line="1.143">A maid servant then brought them water in a
beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver
basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a
clean table beside them. An upper servant brought
them bread, [140] and offered them many good
things of what there was in the house, the carver
fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set
cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant
brought them wine and poured it out for them.</p>
<p n="14" start-line="1.144" end-line="1.157">Then the suitors came in and [145] took their
places on the benches and seats. Right away men
servants poured water over their hands, maids went
round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the
mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid
their hands upon the good things that were before
them. [150] As soon as they had had enough to eat
and drink they wanted music and dancing, which are
the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a
servant brought a lyre to Phemios, whom they
compelled perforce to sing to them. [155] As soon
as he touched his lyre and began to sing
Telemachus spoke low to Athena of the owl’s
vision, with his head close to hers that no man
might hear.</p>
<p n="15" start-line="1.158" end-line="1.177">“I hope, sir,” said he, “that you will not be
offended with what I am going to say. Singing
comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, [160]
and all this is done at the cost of one whose
bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding
to powder in the surf. If these men were to see my
father come back to Ithaca they would pray for
longer legs [165] rather than a longer purse, for
wealth would not serve them; but he, alas, has
fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do
sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed
them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir,
tell me and tell me true, [170] who you are and
where you come from. Tell me of your town and
parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your
crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation
they declared themselves to be—for you cannot have
come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to
know, [175] are you a stranger to this house, or
have you been here in my father’s time? In the old
days we had many visitors for my father went about
much himself.”</p>
<p n="16" start-line="1.178" end-line="1.212">And owl-vision Athena answered, “I will tell
you truly and particularly all about it. [180] I
am Mentes, son of high-spirited Ankhialos, and I
am King of the oar-loving Taphians. I have come
here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of
a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a
cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper.
[185] As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the
open country away from the town, in the harbor
Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neriton. Our
fathers were friends before us, as the old hero
Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him.
They say, however, that he never comes to town
[190] now, and lives by himself in the country,
faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him
and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired
from pottering about his vineyard. They told me
your father was at home again, and that was why I
came, [195] but it seems the gods are still
keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on
the mainland. It is more likely he is on some
sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among
savages who are detaining him against his will.
[200] I am no prophet [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mantis</foreign>], and know very little about
omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from
the sky, and assure you that he will not be away
much longer; for he is a man of such resource that
even though he were in chains of iron he would
find some means [205] of getting home again. But
tell me, and tell me true, can Odysseus really
have such a fine looking young man for a son? You
are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and
eyes, for we were close friends [210] before he
set sail for Troy where the flower of all the
Argives went also. Since that time we have never
either of us seen the other.”</p>
<p n="17" start-line="1.213" end-line="1.220">[215] “My mother,” answered the spirited
Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Odysseus, but it
is a wise child that knows his own father. Would
that I were son to one who had grown old upon his
own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no
more ill-starred man under the sky than he [220]
who they tell me is my father.”</p>
<p n="18" start-line="1.221" end-line="1.229">And owl-vision Athena said, “There is no fear
of your lineage dying out yet, while Penelope has
such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell
me true, [225] what is the meaning of all this
feasting, and who are these people? What is it all
about? Have you some banquet, or is there a
wedding in the family—for no one seems to be
bringing any provisions of his own? And the
guests—how atrociously they are behaving; what
riot they make over the whole house; it is enough
to disgust any respectable person who comes near
them.”</p>
<p n="19" start-line="1.230" end-line="1.251">[230] “Sir,” said the spirited Telemachus, “as
regards your question, so long as my father was
here it was well with us and with the house, but
the gods in their displeasure have willed it
otherwise, [235] and have hidden him away more
closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I
could have borne it better even though he were
dead, if he had fallen with his men in the
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of Troy, or had died with
friends around him when the days of his fighting
were done; for then the Achaeans would have built
a mound over his ashes, [240] and I should myself
have been heir to his renown [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]; <seg
rend="subscript">241</seg> But now the whirlwinds
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">harpuiai</foreign>] have
abducted him, without <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign>. He is gone without leaving so
much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing
but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with
grief for the loss of my father; the gods have
laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; [245]
for the chiefs from all our islands, Doulikhion,
Samē, and the woodland island of Zakynthos, as
also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are
eating up my house under the pretext of paying
their court to my mother, who will neither point
blank say that she will not marry, nor yet [250]
bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc
of my estate, and before long will do so also with
myself.”</p>
<p n="20" start-line="1.252" end-line="1.266">“Is that so?” exclaimed Athena, “Then you do
indeed want absent Odysseus home again. [255] Give
him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and
if he is the man he was when I first knew him in
our house, drinking and making merry, he would
soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,
were he to stand once more upon his own threshold.
He was then coming from Ephyra, [260] where he had
been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilos, son
of Mermeros. Ilos feared the ever-living gods and
would not give him any, but my father let him have
some, for he was very fond of him. [265] If
Odysseus is the man he then was these suitors will
have a swift doom and a sorry wedding.</p>
<p n="21" start-line="1.267" end-line="1.305">But there! It rests with the gods to determine
whether he is to return, and take his revenge in
his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to
set about trying [270] to get rid of these suitors
at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes
in assembly tomorrow—lay your case before them,
and call the gods to bear you witness. Bid the
suitors take themselves off, each to his own
place, [275] and if your mother’s mind is set on
marrying again, let her go back to her father, who
will find her a husband and provide her with all
the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may
expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you
[280] to take the best ship you can get, with a
crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father
who has so long been missing. Some one may tell
you something, or (and people often hear things in
this way) some message [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign>] sent from the gods may direct
you. First you go to Pylos and ask radiant Nestor;
[285] and then from there to Sparta and to
golden-haired Menelaos, the one who was the last
of the Achaeans, wearers of bronze tunics, to come
back home; if you hear that your father is alive
and about to achieve his homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], you can put up
with the waste these suitors will make for yet
another twelve months. If on the other hand you
hear of his death, [290] come home at once,
celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp,
build a grave marker [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sēma</foreign>] to his memory, and make your
mother marry again. Then, having done all this,
think it well over in your mind how, by fair means
or foul, [295] you may kill these suitors in your
own house. You are too old to plead infancy any
longer; have you not heard how people are singing
Orestes’ praises [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign>] for having killed [300] his
father’s murderer treacherous Aegisthus? You are a
fine, smart looking young man; show your mettle,
then, and make yourself a name in story. Now,
however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew,
who will be impatient if I keep them waiting
longer; [305] think the matter over for yourself,
and remember what I have said to you.”</p>
<p n="22" start-line="1.306" end-line="1.313">“Sir,” answered the spirited Telemachus, “it
has been very kind of you to talk to me in this
way, as though I were your own son, and I will do
all you tell me; I know you want to be getting on
with your voyage, but stay a little longer [310]
till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.
I will then give you a present, and you shall go
on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of
great beauty and value—a keepsake such as only
dear friends give to one another.”</p>
<p n="23" start-line="1.314" end-line="1.318">Owl-vision Athena answered, [315] “Do not try
to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As
for any present you may be disposed to make me,
keep it till I come again, and I will take it home
with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I
will give you one of no less value in return.”</p>
<p n="24" start-line="1.319" end-line="1.324">With these words <seg rend="subscript"
>319</seg> owl-vision Athena went away [320] and
like a bird she flew up, but into his heart
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] <seg
rend="subscript">321</seg> she [= Athena] had
placed power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>menos</foreign>] and daring, and she had mentally
connected [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hupo-mnē</foreign>] him with his father <seg
rend="subscript">322</seg> even more than before.
He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that
the stranger had been a god, so he went straight
to where the suitors were sitting.</p>
<p n="25" start-line="1.325" end-line="1.336">[325] The famed singer was singing for them [=
the suitors], and they in silence <seg
rend="subscript">326</seg> sat and listened. He [=
Phemios the singer] was singing the homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of the
Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript">327</seg> a
disastrous [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>lugros</foreign>] homecoming from Troy, and
Pallas Athena was the one who brought it all to
fulfillment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>epi-tellesthai</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>328</seg> From her room upstairs, this divinely
inspired song of his was understood in her mind
by <seg rend="subscript">329</seg> the daughter of
Ikarios, the exceptionally intelligent Penelope,
[330] and she came down the lofty staircase of her
palace. <seg rend="subscript">331</seg> She came
not alone, but attended by two of her
handmaidens. <seg rend="subscript">332</seg> When
she reached the suitors, this most radiant of
women, <seg rend="subscript">333</seg> she stood
by one of the posts that supported the roof of the
halls, <seg rend="subscript">334</seg> holding in
front of her cheeks a luxuriant veil, [335] and a
trusted handmaiden stood on either side of
her. <seg rend="subscript">336</seg> Then,
shedding tears, she addressed the godlike
singer:</p>
<p n="26" start-line="1.337" end-line="1.344"><seg rend="subscript">337</seg> “Phemios, you
know many another thing that charms mortals, <seg

men and gods, to which singers give glory
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleeîn</foreign>]. <seg
rend="subscript">339</seg> Sing for them [= the

them in silence [340] drink their wine. But you
stop this sad song, <seg rend="subscript"

down, since an unforgettable grief [<foreign

<p n="27" start-line="1.345" end-line="1.359">[345] “Mother,” answered the spirited
Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] to;
bards are not responsible [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>] for the ills
they sing of; it is Zeus, not they, who is
responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aitios</foreign>], and who sends weal or woe upon
humankind according to his own good pleasure.
[350] There should be no feeling of sanction
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nemesis</foreign>]
against this one for singing the ill-fated return
of the Danaans, <seg rend="subscript"
>351</seg> for men would most rather give glory
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] to that
song <seg rend="subscript">352</seg> which is the
newest to make the rounds among listeners. Make up
your mind to it and bear it; Odysseus is not the
only man who never came [355] back from Troy, but
many another went down as well as he. Go, then,
within the house and busy yourself with your daily
duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering
of your servants; for speech is man’s matter, and
mine above all others—for it is I who am master
here.”</p>
<p n="28" start-line="1.360" end-line="1.366">[360] She went wondering back into the house,
and laid her son’s saying in her heart. Then,
going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,
she mourned her dear husband till owl-vision
Athena shed sweet sleep over her eyes. [365] But
the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered
halls, and prayed each one that he might be her
bedmate.</p>
<p n="29" start-line="1.367" end-line="1.380">Then the spirited Telemachus spoke, “You
suitors of my mother,” he cried, “you with your
overweening insolence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hubris</foreign>], let us feast at our pleasure
now, and let there be no [370] brawling, for it is
a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine
voice as Phemios has; but in the morning meet me
in full assembly that I may give you formal notice
to depart, and feast at one another’s houses,
[375] turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on
the other hand you choose to persist in sponging
upon one man, may the gods help me, but Zeus shall
reckon with you in full, [380] and when you fall
in my father’s house there shall be no man to
avenge you.”</p>
<p n="30" start-line="1.381" end-line="1.387">The suitors bit their lips as they heard him,
and marveled at the boldness of his speech. Then,
Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, said, “The gods seem
to have given you lessons [385] in bluster and
tall talking; may Zeus never grant you to be chief
in Ithaca as your father was before you.”</p>
<p n="31" start-line="1.388" end-line="1.398">The spirited Telemachus answered, “Antinoos, do
not chide with me, but, [390] god willing, I will
be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you
can think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a
chief, for it brings both riches and honor. Still,
now that Odysseus is dead there are many great men
in Ithaca [395] both old and young, and some other
may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will
be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom
great Odysseus has won for me.”</p>
<p n="32" start-line="1.399" end-line="1.411">Then Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, answered,
[400] “It rests with the gods to decide who shall
be chief among us, but you shall be master in your
own house and over your own possessions; no one
while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you
violence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>]
nor rob you. [405] And now, my good man, I want to
know about this stranger. What country does he
come from? Of what family is he, and where is his
estate? Has he brought you news about the return
of your father, or was he on business of his own?
[410] He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried
off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment
before we could get to know him.”</p>
<p n="33" start-line="1.412" end-line="1.420">“The homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] of my father is dead and gone,”
answered the spirited Telemachus, “and even if
some rumor reaches me I put no more faith in it
now. [415] My mother does indeed sometimes send
for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his
prophesying no heed. As for the stranger, he was
Mentes, son of Ankhialos, chief of the oar-loving
Taphians, an old friend of my father’s.” [420] But
in his heart he knew that it had been the
goddess.</p>
<p n="34" start-line="1.421" end-line="1.444">The suitors then returned to their singing and
dancing until the evening; but when night fell
upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each
in his own abode. [425] Telemachus’ room was high
up in a tower that looked on to the outer court;
there, then, he went, brooding and full of
thought. A good old woman, Eurykleia, daughter of
Ops, the son of Peisenor, went before him with a
couple of blazing torches. [430] Laertes had
bought her with his own wealth when she was quite
young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her,
and showed as much respect to her in his household
as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not
take her to his bed for he feared his wife’s
resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus
to his room, and she loved him [435] better than
any of the other women in the house did, for she
had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the
door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as
he took off his khiton he gave it to the good old
woman, who folded it tidily up, [440] and hung it
for him over a peg by his bed side, after which
she went out, pulled the door to by a silver
catch, and drew the bolt home by means of the
strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a
woolen fleece kept thinking all night through of
his intended voyage and of the counsel that Athena
had given him.</p>

<head>Rhapsody 2</head>
<p n="35" start-line="2.1" end-line="2.14" rend="no-indent">Now when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, dear Telemachus rose
and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to
his comely feet, girded his sword about his
shoulder, [5] and left his room looking like an
immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to
call the people in assembly, so they called them
and the people gathered there; then, when they
were got together, [10] he went to the place of
assembly spear in hand—not alone, for his two
hounds went with him. Athena endowed him with a
presence of such divine gracefulness [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] that all
marveled at him as he went by, and when he took
his place in his father’s seat even the oldest
councilors made way for him.</p>
<p n="36" start-line="2.15" end-line="2.24">[15] Aigyptios, a man bent double with age, and
of infinite experience, was the first to speak.
His son Antiphos the spearman had gone with
Odysseus to Ilion, land of noble steeds, but the
savage Cyclops had killed him [20] when they were
all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last
dinner for him. He had three sons left, of whom
two still worked on their father’s land, while the
third, Eurynomos, was one of the suitors;
nevertheless their father could not get over the
loss of Antiphos, and was still weeping for him
when he began his speech.</p>
<p n="37" start-line="2.25" end-line="2.34">[25] “Men of Ithaca,” he said, “hear my words.
From the day great Odysseus left us there has been
no meeting of our councilors until now; who then
can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so
necessary to convene us? [30] Has he got wind of
some enemy force approaching, and does he wish to
warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter
of public moment? I am sure he is an excellent
person, and I hope Zeus will grant him his heart’s
desire.”</p>
<p n="38" start-line="2.35" end-line="2.79">[35] Telemachus took this speech as of good
omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with
what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the
assembly and the good herald Peisenor, a man of
deep discretion, brought him his staff. Then,
turning to Aigyptios, [40] “Sir,” said he, “it is
I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened
you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have
not got wind of any enemy force approaching about
which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of
public moment on which I would speak. [45] My
grievance is purely personal, and turns on two
great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house.
The first of these is the loss of my excellent
father, who was chief among all you here present,
and was like a father to every one of you; the
second is much more serious, and before long will
be the utter ruin of my estate. [50] The sons of
all the chief men among you are pestering my
mother to marry them against her will. They are
afraid to go to her father Ikarios, asking him to
choose the one he likes best, and to provide
marriage gifts for his daughter, [55] but day by
day they keep hanging about my father’s house,
sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for
their banquets, and never giving so much as a
thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No
estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no
Odysseus to ward off harm from our doors, [60] and
I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never
all my days be as good a man as he was, still I
would indeed defend myself if I had power to do
so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer;
my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have
respect, therefore, to your own consciences [65]
and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] of the
gods, lest they should be displeased and turn upon
you. I pray you by Zeus the Olympian and Themis,
who is the beginning and the end of councils, [70]
[do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me
single-handed—unless it be that my brave father
Odysseus did some wrong to the strong-greaved
Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by
aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I
am to be eaten out of house and home at all, [75]
I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I
could then take action against you to some
purpose, and serve you with notices from house to
house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have
no remedy.”</p>
<p n="39" start-line="2.80" end-line="2.84">[80] With this Telemachus dashed his staff to
the ground and burst into tears. Every one was
very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no
one ventured to make him an angry answer, save
only Antinoos, who spoke thus:</p>
<p n="40" start-line="2.85" end-line="2.102">[85] “Telemachus, insolent braggart that you
are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us
suitors? We are not the ones who are responsible
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aitioi</foreign>] but
your mother is, for she knows many kinds of
craftiness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kerdos</foreign>]. This three years past, and
close on four, [90] she has been driving us out of
our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and
sending him messages that say one thing but her
mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]
means other things. And then there was that other
trick she played us. She set up a great loom in
her room, and began to weave [95] an enormous fine
web. ‘Sweet hearts,’ said she, ‘Great Odysseus is
indeed dead, still do not press me to marry again
immediately, wait—for I would not have skill in
weaving perish unrecorded—till I have completed a
shroud for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness
against the time when [100] death shall take him.
He is very rich, and the women of the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] will
talk if he is laid out without a shroud.’</p>
<p n="41" start-line="2.103" end-line="2.128">This was what she said, and we assented;
whereon we could see her working on her great web
all day long, [105] but at night she would undo it
again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for
three years and we never found her out, but as
time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>]
wore on and she was now in her fourth year, one of
her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and
we caught her in the act of undoing her work,
[110] so she had to finish it whether she would or
no. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer,
that both you and the Achaeans may
understand—‘Send your mother away, and bid her
marry the man of her own and of her father’s
choice’; [115] for I do not know what will happen
if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the
airs she gives herself on the score of the
accomplishments Athena has taught her, and because
she knows so many kinds of <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>. We never yet
heard of such a woman; we know all about [120]
Tyro, Alkmene, Mycenae, wearer of garlands, and
the famous women of old. <seg rend="subscript"
>121</seg> Of all these women, not one knew
thoughts equal to [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>homoia</foreign>] the thoughts <seg
rend="subscript">122</seg> knew, but they were
nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was
not fair of her to treat us in that way, and as
long as she continues in the mind [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] with which the
gods have now endowed her, so long shall we go on
eating up your estate; [125] and I do not see why
she should change, for she gets all the honor and
glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>],
and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand,
then, that we will not go back to our lands,
neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her
choice and married some one or other of us.”</p>
<p n="42" start-line="2.129" end-line="2.145">The spirited Telemachus answered, [130]
“Antinoos, how can I drive the mother who bore me
from my father’s house? My father is abroad and we
do not know whether he is alive or dead. It will
be hard on me if I have to pay Ikarios the large
sum which I must give him if I insist on sending
his daughter back to him. Not only will he deal
rigorously with me, but some superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] will
also [135] punish me; for my mother when she
leaves the house will call on the Furies [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">Erinyes</foreign>] to avenge her;
besides, it would not be a creditable thing to do
[= “it will result in <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nemesis </foreign>for me among men”], and I will
have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take
offence at this, leave the house and feast
elsewhere [140] at one another’s houses at your
own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other
hand, you elect to persist in sponging upon one
man, may the gods help me, but Zeus shall reckon
with you in full, [145] and when you fall in my
father’s house there shall be no man to avenge
you.”</p>
<p n="43" start-line="2.146" end-line="2.160">As he spoke Zeus sent two eagles from the top
of the mountain, and they flew on and on with the
wind, sailing side-by-side in their own lordly
flight. [150] When they were right over the middle
of the assembly they wheeled and circled about,
beating the air with their wings and glaring death
into the eyes of them that were below; then,
fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they
flew off towards the right over the town. [155]
The people wondered as they saw them, and asked
each other what all this might be; whereon the
aged warrior Halitherses, who was the best prophet
and reader of omens among them, [160] spoke to
them plainly and in all honesty, saying:</p>
<p n="44" start-line="2.161" end-line="2.176">“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more
particularly to the suitors, for I see mischief
brewing for them. Odysseus is not going to be away
much longer; indeed [165] he is close at hand to
deal out death and destruction, not on them alone,
but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let
us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this
wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so
of their own accord; it will be better for them,
[170] for I am not prophesying without due
knowledge; everything has happened to resourceful
Odysseus as I foretold when the Argives set out
for Troy, and he with them. I said that after
going through much hardship and losing all his men
[175] he should come home again in the twentieth
year and that no one would know him; and now all
this is coming true.”</p>
<p n="45" start-line="2.177" end-line="2.207">Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, then said, “Go
home, old man, and prophesy to your own children,
or it may be worse for them. I can read these
omens myself [180] much better than you can; birds
are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere
or other, but they seldom mean anything. Odysseus
has died in a far country, and it is a pity you
are not dead along with him, instead of prating
here about omens [185] and adding fuel to the
anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it
is. I suppose you think he will give you something
for your family, but I tell you—and it shall
surely be—when an old man like you, who should
know better, talks a young one over till he
becomes troublesome, [190] in the first place his
young friend will only fare so much the worse—he
will take nothing by it, for the suitors will
prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a
heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at
all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you.
As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of
you all [195] to send his mother back to her
father, who will find her a husband and provide
her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter
may expect. Till then we shall go on harassing him
with our suit; for we fear no man, [200] and care
neither for him, with all his fine speeches, nor
for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach
as much as you please, but we shall only hate you
the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up
Telemachus’ estate without paying him, till such
time as his mother leaves off tormenting us [205]
by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of
expectation, each vying with the other in his suit
for a prize of such rare perfection [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>]. Besides we
cannot go after the other women whom we should
marry in due course, but for the way in which she
treats us.”</p>
<p n="46" start-line="2.208" end-line="2.223">Then the spirited Telemachus said, “Eurymakhos,
and you other haughty suitors, [210] I shall say
no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods
and the people of Ithaca now know my story. Give
me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take
me here and there, and I will go to Sparta and to
Pylos [215] to inquire about the <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign> of my father who
has so long been missing. Some one may tell me
something, or (and people often hear <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign> in this way) some
message sent from the gods may direct me. If I can
hear of him as alive and achieving his homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] I will
put up with the waste you suitors will make for
yet another [220] twelve months. If on the other
hand I hear of his death, I will return at once,
celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp,
build a grave marker [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sēma</foreign>] to his memory, and make my mother
marry again.”</p>
<p n="47" start-line="2.224" end-line="2.228">With these words he sat down, [225] and Mentor
who had been a friend of stately Odysseus, and had
been left in charge of everything with full
authority over the servants, rose to speak. He,
then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them
thus:</p>
<p n="48" start-line="2.229" end-line="2.241">“Hear me, men of Ithaca, [230] I hope that you
may never have a kind and well-disposed ruler any
more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I
hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be
cruel and unjust, for there is not one of you but
has forgotten godlike Odysseus, who ruled you as
though he were your father. [235] I am not half so
angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do
violence in the naughtiness of their minds
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], and
wager their heads that Odysseus will not return,
they can take the high hand and eat up his estate,
but as for you others I am shocked at the way
[240] in which you the rest of the population
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] all sit
still without even trying to stop such scandalous
goings on—which you could do if you chose, for you
are many and they are few.”</p>
<p n="49" start-line="2.242" end-line="2.256">Leiokritos, son of Euenor, answered him saying,
“Mentor, what folly is all this, that you should
set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing
[245] for one man to fight with many about his
victuals. Even though Odysseus himself were to set
upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do
his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back
so very badly, would have small cause for
rejoicing, [250] and his blood would be upon his
own head if he fought against such great odds.
There is no sense in what you have been saying.
Now, therefore, do you people go about your
business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor
and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if
he goes at all— [255] which I do not think he
will, for he is more likely to stay where he is
till some one comes and tells him something.”</p>
<p n="50" start-line="2.257" end-line="2.259">Then he broke up the assembly, and every man
went back to his own abode, while the suitors
returned to the house of godlike Odysseus.</p>
<p n="51" start-line="2.260" end-line="2.266">[260] Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea
side, washed his hands in the gray waves, and
prayed to Athena. “Hear me,” he cried, “you god
who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the
seas in search of the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign> of my father [265] who has so
long been missing. I would obey you, but the
Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked
suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do
so.”</p>
<p n="52" start-line="2.267" end-line="2.295">As he thus prayed, Athena came close up to him
in the likeness and with the voice of
Mentor. [270] “Telemachus, you will not be weak or
resourceless in the future <seg rend="subscript"
>271</seg> if truly the goodly power [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>] of your father
has been instilled in you, for Odysseus never
broke his word nor left his work half done. If,
then, you take after him, your voyage will not be
fruitless, but unless you have the blood of
Odysseus and of Penelope in your veins [275] I see
no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom
as good men as their fathers; they are generally
worse, not better; still, as you are not going to
be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not
entirely without some share of your father’s wise
discernment, [280] I look with hope upon your
undertaking. But mind you never have thoughts
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] like
those of any of those foolish suitors, for they
are neither sensible nor just [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikaioi</foreign>], and give no
thought to death and to the doom that will shortly
fall on one and all of them, so that they shall
perish on the same day. [285] As for your voyage,
it shall not be long delayed; your father was such
an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship,
and will come with you myself. Now, however,
return home, and go about among the suitors; begin
getting provisions ready for your voyage; see
everything well stowed, [290] the wine in jars,
and the barley meal, which is the staff of life,
in leather bags, while I go round the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] and
round up volunteers at once. There are many ships
in Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over
them for you and will choose the best; [295] we
will get her ready and will put out to sea without
delay.”</p>
<p n="53" start-line="2.296" end-line="2.308">Thus spoke Athena, daughter of Zeus, and
Telemachus lost no time in doing as the goddess
told him. He went moodily and found the suitors
[300] flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer
court. Antinoos came up to him at once and laughed
as he took his hand in his own, saying,
“Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill
blood neither in word [305] nor deed, but eat and
drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans will
find you in everything—a ship and a picked crew to
boot—so that you can set sail for sacred Pylos at
once and get news of your noble father.”</p>
<p n="54" start-line="2.309" end-line="2.320">“Antinoos,” answered the spirited Telemachus,
[310] “I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of
any kind with such men as you are. Was it not
enough that you should waste so much good property
of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older
and [315] know more about it, I am also stronger,
and whether here among this people [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], or by going to
Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. I shall
go, and my going will not be in vain though,
thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor
crew of my own, and must be passenger not
captain.”</p>
<p n="55" start-line="2.321" end-line="2.323">[320] As he spoke he snatched his hand from
that of Antinoos. Meanwhile the others went on
getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering
at him tauntingly as they did so.</p>
<p n="56" start-line="2.324" end-line="2.330">[325] “Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means
to be the death of us; I suppose he thinks he can
bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again
from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will
he go to Ephyra as well, for poison [330] to put
in our wine and kill us?”</p>
<p n="57" start-line="2.331" end-line="2.336">Another said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on
board ship, he will be like his father and perish
far from his friends. In this case we should have
plenty to do, [335] for we could then divide up
his property amongst us: as for the house we can
let his mother and the man who marries her have
that.”</p>
<p n="58" start-line="2.337" end-line="2.360">This was how they talked. But Telemachus went
down into the lofty and spacious store-room where
his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay
heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and
spare clothes were kept in open chests. Here, too,
there was a store of fragrant olive oil, [340]
while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended
and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against
the wall in case Odysseus should come home again
after all. The room was closed with well-made
doors [345] opening in the middle; moreover the
faithful old house-keeper Eurykleia, daughter of
Ops, the son of Peisenor, was in charge of
everything both night and day. Telemachus called
her to the store-room and said: “Nurse, draw me
off some [350] of the best wine you have, after
what you are keeping for my father’s own drinking,
in case, poor man, he should escape death, and
find his way home again after all. Let me have
twelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also
fill me some well-sewn leather bags with barley
meal [355] —about twenty measures in all. Get
these things put together at once, and say nothing
about it. I will take everything away this evening
as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the
night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos,
and [360] I am going to find out about
the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign> of
my father, if I should hear.”</p>
<p n="59" start-line="2.361" end-line="2.370">When dear Eurykleia heard this she began to
cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, “My dear
child, what ever can have put such notion as that
into your head? Where in the world do you want to
go to— [365] you, who are the one hope of the
house? Your poor illustrious father is dead and
gone in some foreign locale [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] nobody knows
where, and as soon as your back is turned these
wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put
out of the way, and will share all your
possessions among themselves; stay where you are
among your own people, [370] and do not go
wandering and worrying your life out on the barren
ocean.”</p>
<p n="60" start-line="2.371" end-line="2.376">“Fear not, nurse,” answered the spirited
Telemachus, “my scheme is not without the sanction
of the gods; but swear that you will say nothing
about all this to my mother, till I have been away
some ten or twelve days, [375] unless she hears of
my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want
her to spoil her beauty by crying.”</p>
<p n="61" start-line="2.377" end-line="2.381">The old woman swore most solemnly that she
would not, and when she had completed her oath,
she began drawing off the wine into jars, [380]
and getting the barley meal into the bags, while
Telemachus went back to the suitors.</p>
<p n="62" start-line="2.382" end-line="2.392">Then owl-vision Athena turned her thoughts to
another matter. She took his shape, and went round
the town to each one of the crew, telling them
[385] to meet at the ship by sundown. She went
also to Noemon, glorious son of Phronios, and
asked him to let her have a ship—which he was very
ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was
over all the land, she got the ship into the
water, put [390] all the tackle on board her that
ships generally carry, and stationed her at the
end of the harbor. Presently the crew came up, and
the owl-vision goddess spoke encouragingly to each
of them.</p>
<p n="63" start-line="2.393" end-line="2.401">Furthermore she went to the house of godlike
Odysseus, [395] and threw the suitors into a deep
slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them,
and made them drop their cups from their hands, so
that instead of sitting over their wine, they went
back into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy
and full of drowsiness. [400] Then she took the
form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to
come outside.</p>
<p n="64" start-line="2.402" end-line="2.412">“Telemachus,” said she, “the strong-greaved men
are on board and at their oars, waiting for you to
give your orders, so make haste and let us be
off.” [405] Then she led the way, while Telemachus
followed in her steps. When they got to the ship
they found the crew waiting by the water side, and
the hallowed prince, Telemachus said, [410] “Now
my men, help me to get the stores on board; they
are all put together in the hall, and my mother
does not know anything about it, nor any of the
maid servants except one.”</p>
<p n="65" start-line="2.413" end-line="2.433">With these words he led the way and the others
followed after. [415] When they had brought the
things as he told them, dear son of Odysseus,
Telemachus went on board, Athena going before him
and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel,
while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men
loosed the hawsers and took their places on the
benches. [420] Owl-vision Athena sent them a fair
wind from the West, that whistled over the deep
blue waves whereon Telemachus told them to catch
hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as
he told them. They set the mast in its socket in
the cross plank, raised it, [425] and made it fast
with the forestays; then they hoisted their white
sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox-hide. As the
sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew
through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed
against her bows as she sped onward. [430] Then
they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the
mixing-bowls to the brim, and made drink offerings
to the immortal gods that are from everlasting,
but more particularly to the owl-vision daughter
of Zeus.</p>
<p n="66" start-line="2.434" end-line="2.434">Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through
the watches of the night from dark till dawn.</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 3</head>
<p n="67" start-line="3.1" end-line="3.11" rend="no-indent">But as the sun was rising from
the fair sea into the firmament of the sky to shed
light on mortals and immortals, they reached
Pylos, the strong-founded city of Neleus. [5] Now
the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore
to offer sacrifice of black bulls to dark-haired
Poseidon, lord of the Earthquake. There were nine
guilds with five hundred men in each, and there
were nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating
the innards and burning the thigh bones [on the
embers] in the name of Poseidon, [10] Telemachus
and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought
their ship to anchor, and went ashore.</p>
<p n="68" start-line="3.12" end-line="3.20">Owl-vision Athena led the way and Telemachus
followed her. Presently she said, “Telemachus, you
must not at all feel shame [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] or be nervous;
[15] you have taken this voyage to try and find
out where your father is buried and how he came by
his end; so go straight up to Nestor, breaker of
horses, that we may see what he has got to tell
us. Beg of him to speak the truth, [20] and he
will tell no lies, for he is an excellent
person.”</p>
<p n="69" start-line="3.21" end-line="3.24">“But how, Mentor,” replied the spirited
Telemachus, “dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I
to address him? I have never yet been used to
holding long conversations with people, and feel
shame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>]
about questioning one who is so much older than
myself.”</p>
<p n="70" start-line="3.25" end-line="3.28">[25] “Some things, Telemachus,” answered
owl-vision Athena, “will be suggested to you by
your own instinct, and some superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] will
prompt you further; for I am assured that the gods
have been with you from the time of your birth
until now.”</p>
<p n="71" start-line="3.29" end-line="3.42">She then went quickly on, [30] and Telemachus
followed in her steps till they reached the place
where the guilds of the Pylian people were
assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with
his sons, while his company round him were busy
getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat
on to the spits while other pieces were cooking.
When they saw the strangers they crowded round
them, [35] took them by the hand and bade them
take their places. Nestor’s son Peisistratos at
once offered his hand to each of them, and seated
them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on
the sands near his father and his brother
Thrasymedes. [40] Then he gave them their portions
of the innards and poured wine for them into a
golden cup, handing it to Athena first, and
saluting her at the same time.</p>
<p n="72" start-line="3.43" end-line="3.50">“Offer a prayer, sir,” said he, “to lord
Poseidon, for it is his feast that you are
joining; [45] when you have duly prayed and made
your drink-offering, pass the cup to your friend
that he may do so also. I doubt not that he too
lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live
without gods in the world. Still, he is younger
than you are, and is much of an age with myself,
[50] so I will give you the precedence.”</p>
<p n="73" start-line="3.51" end-line="3.61">As he spoke he handed her the cup. Athena
thought that he was just [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikaios</foreign>] and right to have given it to
herself first; she accordingly began praying
heartily to Poseidon. [55] “O god,” she cried,
“you who encircle the earth, grant the prayers of
your servants that call upon you. More especially
we pray you send down your grace on Nestor and on
his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the
Pylian people some handsome return for the goodly
hecatomb they are offering you. [60] Lastly, grant
Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of
the matter that has brought us in our swift black
ship to Pylos.”</p>
<p n="74" start-line="3.62" end-line="3.68">When she had thus made an end of praying, she
handed the cup to dear Telemachus and he prayed
likewise. [65] By and by, when the outer meats
were roasted and had been taken off the
spits, <seg rend="subscript">66</seg> apportioning
portions [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>moirai</foreign>], they feasted a very glorious
feast [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dais</foreign>].
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,
Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, began to speak.</p>
<p n="75" start-line="3.69" end-line="3.74">“Now,” said he, “that our guests have done
their dinner, [70] it will be best to ask them who
they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and
from what port have you sailed? Are you traders?
Or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand
against every man, and every man’s hand against
you?”</p>
<p n="76" start-line="3.75" end-line="3.101">[75] The spirited Telemachus answered boldly,
for Athena had given him courage to ask about his
father and get himself a good name [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]. “Nestor,” said
he, “son of Neleus, honor to the Achaean name,
[80] you ask whence we come, and I will tell you.
We come from Ithaca under Neriton, and the matter
about which I would speak is of private not public
import. <seg rend="subscript">83</seg> I am going
after the widespread <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign> of my father, if I should hear,
radiant patient-hearted Odysseus, who is said [85]
to have ransacked the town of Troy in company with
yourself. We know what fate befell each one of the
other heroes who fought at Troy, but as regards
Odysseus the gods have hidden from us the
knowledge even that he is dead at all, for no one
can certify us in what place he perished, [90] nor
say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or
was lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite.
Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if haply
you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy
end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or
heard it from some [95] other traveler, for he was
a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of
any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness
exactly what you saw. If my brave father Odysseus
ever did you loyal service, either by word or
deed, [100] when you Achaeans were harassed among
the [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]
Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favor and
tell me truly all.”</p>
<p n="77" start-line="3.102" end-line="3.129">“My friend,” answered Nestor, “you recall a
time of much sorrow to my mind, for the brave
Achaeans [105] suffered much both at sea, while
privateering under Achilles, and when fighting
before the great city of king Priam. Our best men
all of them fell there—Ajax, Achilles, [110]
Patroklos, peer of gods in counsel, and my own
dear son, Antilokhos, a man singularly fleet of
foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much
more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could
tell the whole story? [115] Though you were to
stay here and question me for five years, or even
six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans
suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my
tale before it ended. Nine long years did we try
every kind of stratagem, but the hand of the gods
[120] was against us. [120] Back then, there was
nobody who would set himself up as equal to
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">homoios</foreign>] him
[= Odysseus] in craft [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mētis</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
>121</seg> no, nobody would be willing to do so,
since radiant Odysseus was so much better, your
father—if indeed you are his son. I can hardly
believe my eyes—and you talk just like him too—no
one would [125] say that people of such different
ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had
any kind of difference from first to last neither
in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart
and purpose [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] we advised the Argives how all
might be ordered for the best.</p>
<p n="78" start-line="3.130" end-line="3.136">[130] But after we [= the Achaeans] had
destroyed the lofty city of Priam <seg
rend="subscript">131</seg> and we went into our
ships, the god dispersed us. <seg rend="subscript"
>132</seg> And then it was that Zeus devised in
his thinking a plan to make a disastrous [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">lugros</foreign>] homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] <seg
rend="subscript">133</seg> for the Argives [=
Achaeans]; for they had not at all been either
mindful [= having <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] or just [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikaioi</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
>134</seg> not all of them, and so many of them
met up with a bad destiny [135] because of the
disastrous [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>oloē</foreign>] anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mēnis</foreign>] of the daughter of the mighty
father—of the goddess with the looks of an owl,
who brought about a quarrel [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">eris</foreign>] between the two
sons of Atreus.</p>
<p n="79" start-line="3.137" end-line="3.150">The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was
not as it should be [= without <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>], for it was
sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine.
[140] When they explained why they had called the
people together, it seemed that Menelaos was for
sailing homeward [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] at once, and this displeased
Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we
had offered hecatombs [145] to appease the anger
of Athena. Fool that he was, he might have known
that he would not prevail with her, for when the
gods have made up their minds [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] they do not change
them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard
words, whereon the strong-greaved Achaeans sprang
to their feet [150] with a cry that rent the air,
and were of two minds as to what they should
do.</p>
<p n="80" start-line="3.151" end-line="3.183">That night we rested and nursed our anger, for
Zeus was hatching mischief against us. But in the
morning some of us drew our ships into the water
and put our goods with our women on board, [155]
while the rest, about half in number, stayed
behind with Agamemnon. We—the other half—embarked
and sailed; and the ships went well, for the gods
had smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we
offered sacrifices to the gods, [160] for we were
longing for our homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]; cruel Zeus,
however, did not yet mean that we should do so,
and raised a second quarrel in the course of which
some among us turned their ships back again, and
sailed away under Odysseus to make their peace
with Agamemnon; [165] but I, and all the ships
that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that
mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on
also with me, and his crews with him. <seg
rend="subscript">168</seg> He came late,
golden-haired Menelaos did, after the two of us [=
Nestor and Diomedes]. <seg rend="subscript"
>169</seg> It was at Lesbos that he [= Menelaos]
caught up with us, as we were planning the long
part of our sea voyage— [170] for we did not know
whether to go outside Chios by the island of
Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios,
over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we
asked a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] for a sign, and were shown one
to the effect that we should be soonest out of
danger if we headed our ships across the open sea
[175] to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair
wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage
during the night to Geraistos, where we offered
many sacrifices to Poseidon for having helped us
so far on our way. [180] Four days later Diomedes,
breaker of horses, and his men stationed their
ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the
wind never fell light from the day when the gods
first made it fair for me.</p>
<p n="81" start-line="3.184" end-line="3.200">Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned
without hearing anything [185] about the others. I
know neither who got home safely nor who were lost
but, as in duty bound, I will give you without
reserve the reports that have reached me since I
have been here in my own house. They say the
Myrmidons returned home safely under great-hearted
Achilles’ glorious son, Neoptolemos; [190] so also
did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes.
Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his
followers who escaped death in the field got safe
home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of
the world you live, you will have heard of
Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands
of Aegisthus [195] and a fearful reckoning did
treacherous Aegisthus presently pay. See what a
good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind
him to do as Orestes did, who killed false
Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You
too, then—for you are a tall, smart-looking young
man— [200] show your mettle and make yourself a
name in story.”</p>
<p n="82" start-line="3.201" end-line="3.209">“Nestor, son of Neleus,” answered the spirited
Telemachus, “honor to the Achaean name, the
Achaeans will bear the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign> of Orestes in song [205] even to
future generations, for he has avenged his father
nobly. Would that the gods might grant me to do
like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked
suitors, who are ill-treating me and plotting my
ruin; but the gods have no such happiness
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>] in
store for me and for my father, so we must bear it
as best we may.”</p>
<p n="83" start-line="3.210" end-line="3.224">[210] “My friend,” said Nestor, the charioteer
of Gerenia, “now that you remind me, I remember to
have heard that your mother has many suitors, who
are ill-disposed towards you and are making havoc
of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely, or
are the people of the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>, [215] following the voice of a
god, against you? Who knows but that Odysseus may
come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in
full, either single-handed or with a force of
Achaeans behind him? If owl-vision Athena were to
take as great a liking to you as she did to
glorious Odysseus [220] when we were fighting in
the Trojan <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos </foreign>(for I never yet saw the gods so
openly fond of anyone as Athena then was of your
father), if she would take as good care of you as
she did of him, these wooers would soon some of
them forget their wooing.”</p>
<p n="84" start-line="3.225" end-line="3.228">[225] The spirited Telemachus answered, “I can
expect nothing of the kind; it would be far too
much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of
it. Even though the gods themselves willed it no
such good fortune could befall me.”</p>
<p n="85" start-line="3.229" end-line="3.238">Then owl-vision goddess Athena said, [230]
“Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven
has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and
if it were me, I should not care how much I
suffered before getting home, provided I could be
safe when I was once there. I would rather this,
than get home quickly, and then be killed in my
own house as Agamemnon [235] was by the treachery
of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is
certain, and when a man’s hour is come, not even
the gods can save him, no matter how fond they are
of him.”</p>
<p n="86" start-line="3.239" end-line="3.252">[240] “Mentor,” answered the spirited
Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more.
There is no chance of my father’s ever having a
homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>]; the gods have long since
counseled his destruction. There is something
else, however, about which I should like to ask
Nestor, for he knows much more than anyone else
does. [245] They say he has reigned for three
generations so that it is like talking to an
immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell me
true [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">alēthēs</foreign>];
how did widely ruling Agamemnon come to die in
that way? What was Menelaos doing? And how came
false Aegisthus [250] to kill so far better a man
than himself? Was Menelaos away from Achaean
Argos, voyaging elsewhere among humankind, that
Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?”</p>
<p n="87" start-line="3.253" end-line="3.264">“I will tell you truly [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alēthēs</foreign>],” answered
Nestor, the charioteer of Gerenia, [255] “and
indeed you have yourself divined how it all
happened. If fair-haired Menelaos when he got back
from Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his
house, there would have been no grave marker
heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but
he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs
[260] and vultures, and not a woman would have
mourned him, for he had done a deed of great
wickedness; but we were over there, enduring
ordeals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthloi</foreign>] at Troy, and Aegisthus who was
taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos,
cajoled Agamemnon’s wife, beautiful Clytemnestra,
with incessant flattery.</p>
<p n="88" start-line="3.265" end-line="3.275">[265] At first she would have nothing to do
with his wicked scheme, for she was of a good
natural disposition; moreover there was a singer
with her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict
orders on setting out for Troy, that he was to
keep guard over his wife; but when the gods had
counseled her destruction, [270] Aegisthus led
this bard off to a desert island and left him
there for crows and seagulls to batten upon—after
which she went willingly enough to the house of
Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices
to the gods, and decorated many temples with
tapestries and gilding, [275] for he had succeeded
far beyond his expectations.</p>
<p n="89" start-line="3.276" end-line="3.312">Meanwhile Menelaos and I were on our way home
from Troy, on good terms with one another. When we
got to Sounion, which is the point of Athens,
Apollo with his painless [280] shafts killed
Phrontis son of Onētor, the steersman [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>] of Menelaos’
ship (and never a man knew better how to handle a
vessel in rough weather), so that he died then and
there with the steering-oar in his hand, and
Menelaos, though very anxious to press forward,
[285] had to wait in order to bury his comrade and
give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he
too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as
far as the Malean headland, Zeus of the wide brows
counseled evil against him and made it blow hard
[290] till the waves ran mountains high. Here he
divided his fleet and took the one half towards
Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the
waters of the river Iardanos. There is a high
headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea
from a place called Gortyn, [295] and all along
this part of the coast as far as Phaistos the sea
runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but
past Phaistos the coast is more protected, for a
small headland can make a great shelter. Here this
part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and
wrecked; but the crews just managed to save
themselves. [300] As for the other five ships,
they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where
Menelaos gathered much gold and substance among
people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus
here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven
years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in
golden Mycenae, [305] and the people were obedient
under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came
back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the
murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the
funeral rites [310] of his mother and of false
unwarlike Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of
Argos, and on that very day Menelaos of the great
cry came home, with as much treasure as his ships
could carry.</p>
<p n="90" start-line="3.313" end-line="3.328">Take my advice then, and do not go traveling
about for long so far from home, nor leave your
property with such dangerous people in your house;
[315] they will eat up everything you have among
them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand.
Still, I should advise you by all means to go and
visit Menelaos, who has lately come off a voyage
among such distant peoples as no man could ever
hope to get back from, [320] when the winds had
once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even
birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so
vast and terrifying are the seas that they must
cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your
own men with you; or if you would rather travel by
land you can have a chariot, [325] you can have
horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to
Lacedaemon where fair-haired Menelaos lives. Beg
of him to speak the truth, and he will tell you no
lies, for he is an excellent person.”</p>
<p n="91" start-line="3.329" end-line="3.336">As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark,
[330] whereon owl-vision goddess Athena said,
“Sir, all that you have said is well; now,
however, order the tongues of the victims to be
cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings
to Poseidon, and the other immortals, and then go
to bed, for it is time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hōra</foreign>]. [335] People should go away
early and not keep late hours at a religious
festival.”</p>
<p n="92" start-line="3.337" end-line="3.345">Thus spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they
obeyed her saying. Men servants poured water over
the hands of the guests, while pages filled the
mixing-bowls with wine and water, [340] and handed
it round after giving every man his
drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the
victims into the fire, and stood up to make their
drink-offerings. When they had made their
offerings and had drunk each as much as he was
minded, Athena and godlike Telemachus were for
going on board their ship, [345] but Nestor caught
them up at once and stayed them.</p>
<p n="93" start-line="3.346" end-line="3.355">“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed,
“forbid that you should leave my house to go on
board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and
short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks as
to be unable to find comfortable beds [350] both
for myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I
have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not
permit the son of my old friend Odysseus to camp
down on the deck of a ship—not while I live—nor
yet will my sons after me, [355] but they will
keep open house as I have done.”</p>
<p n="94" start-line="3.356" end-line="3.370">Then the owl-vision goddess Athena answered,
“Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much
better that Telemachus should do as you have said;
he, therefore, shall return with you and sleep
[360] at your house, but I must go back to give
orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I
am the only older person among them; the rest are
all young men of Telemachus’ own age, who have
taken this voyage out of friendship; [365] so I
must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover
tomorrow I must go to the great-hearted Kaukones
where I have a large sum of wealth long owed to
me. As for Telemachus, now that he is your guest,
send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let one
of your sons go with him. Be pleased also to
provide him with [370] your best and fleetest
horses.”</p>
<p n="95" start-line="3.371" end-line="3.384">When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the
form of an eagle, and all marveled as they beheld
it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus by
the hand. [375] “My friend,” said he, “I see that
you are going to be a great hero some day, since
the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so
young. This can have been none other of those who
dwell in the sky than Zeus’ terrifying daughter,
the most-honored Trito-born, who showed such favor
towards your brave father among the Argives.”
[380] “Holy queen,” he continued, “send down noble
glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]
upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In
return, I will offer you in sacrifice a
broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and
never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will
gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in
sacrifice.”</p>
<p n="96" start-line="3.385" end-line="3.403">[385] Thus did he pray, and Athena heard his
prayer. He then led the way to his own house,
followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When they
had got there and had taken their places on the
benches and seats, [390] he mixed them a bowl of
sweet wine that was eleven years old when the
housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it.
As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made
drink-offerings to Athena, daughter of
Aegis-bearing Zeus. [395] Then, when they had made
their drink-offerings and had drunk each as much
as he was minded, the others went home to bed each
in his own abode; but Nestor, the charioteer of
Gerenia, put Telemachus, the dear son of godlike
Odysseus, to sleep in the room that was over the
gateway [400] along with Peisistratos, who was the
only unmarried son now left him. As for himself,
he slept in an inner room of the house, with the
queen his wife by his side.</p>
<p n="97" start-line="3.404" end-line="3.417">Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered
Dawn, appeared, [405] Nestor, the charioteer of
Gerenia, left his couch and took his seat on the
benches of white and polished marble that stood in
front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus,
peer of gods in counsel, [410] but he was now
dead, and had gone to the house of Hādēs; so
Nestor of Gerenia sat in his seat, scepter in
hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as
they left their rooms gathered round him,
Ekhephron, Stratios, Perseus, Aretos, and
Thrasymedes; [415] the sixth son was the hero
Peisistratos, and when godlike Telemachus joined
them they made him sit with them. Nestor then
addressed them.</p>
<p n="98" start-line="3.418" end-line="3.429">“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I
shall bid you. I wish first and foremost to
propitiate the great goddess Athena, [420] who
manifested herself visibly to me during
yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or other of
you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out
a heifer, and come on here with it at once. [425]
Another must go to great-hearted Telemachus’ ship,
and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in
charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and
fetch Laerkeus the goldsmith to gild the horns of
the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you
are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an
excellent dinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of
wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring
me some clear spring water.”</p>
<p n="99" start-line="3.430" end-line="3.446">[430] Then they hurried off on their several
errands. The heifer was brought in from the plain,
and great-hearted Telemachus’ crew came from the
ship; the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and
tongs, [435] with which he worked his gold, and
Athena herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor, the
old charioteer, gave out the gold, and the smith
gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess
might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratios
and noble Ekhephron brought her in by [440] the
horns; Aretos fetched water from the house in a
ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his
other hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy
Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to
strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.
[445] Then Nestor began with washing his hands and
sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered many a
prayer to Athena as he threw a lock from the
heifer’s head upon the fire.</p>
<p n="100" start-line="3.447" end-line="3.463">When they had done praying and sprinkling the
barley meal Thrasymedes, the high-hearted son of
Nestor dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down
with a stroke that cut through the tendons [450]
at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and
daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife
Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Klymenos)
shouted ‘ololu’ in delight. Then they lifted the
heifer’s head from off the ground, and
Peisistratos, leader of men, cut her throat. [455]
When she had done bleeding and was quite dead,
they cut her up. They cut out the thigh-bones,
wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some
pieces of raw meat on the top of them. <seg
rend="subscript">459</seg> And the old man burned
them [= the thigh bones] over splinters of wood,
and bright wine did he [460] pour over them, while
the young men were getting ready for him the
five-pronged forks that they were holding in their
hands. When the thighs were burned and they had
tasted the innards, they cut the rest of the meat
up small, put the pieces on the spits and toasted
them over the fire.</p>
<p n="101" start-line="3.464" end-line="3.476">Meanwhile lovely Polykaste, [465] Nestor’s
youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When she had
washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought
him a fair mantle and khiton. <seg
rend="subscript">468</seg> He emerged from the
bathtub [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>asaminthos</foreign>], looking like [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">homoios</foreign>] the immortals
in size, and took his seat by the side of Nestor.
[470] When the outer meats were done they drew
them off the spits and sat down to dinner where
they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who
kept pouring them out their wine in cups of gold.
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink
Nestor, the charioteer of Gerenia, said, [475]
“Sons, put Telemachus’ horses to the chariot that
he may start at once.”</p>
<p n="102" start-line="3.477" end-line="3.497">Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had
said, and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot.
The housekeeper packed them up a provision of
bread, wine, [480] and sweetmeats fit for the sons
of princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot,
while Peisistratos, leader of men, the son of
Nestor, gathered up the reins and took his seat
beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew
forward nothing loath [485] into the open country,
leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All
that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon
their necks till the sun went down and darkness
was over all the land. Then they reached Pherai
where Diokles lived, who was son to Ortilokhos and
grandson to Alpheus. [490] Here they passed the
night and Diokles entertained them hospitably.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn;
appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove
out through the gateway under the echoing
gatehouse. Peisistratos lashed the horses on and
they flew forward, holding back nothing; [495]
presently they came to the wheat lands of the open
country, and in the course of time completed their
journey, so well did their steeds take them. Now
when the sun had set and darkness was over the
land…</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 4</head>
<p n="103" start-line="4.1" end-line="4.14" rend="no-indent">They reached the low-lying
city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight to
the halls of glorious Menelaos. They found him in
his own house, feasting with his many clansmen in
honor of the wedding of his son, and also of his
daughter, whom [5] he was marrying to the son of
that valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his
consent and promised her to him while he was still
at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the
marriage about; so he was sending her with
chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons
over whom Achilles’ son [10] was reigning. For his
only son he had found a bride from Sparta,
daughter of Alektor. This son, Megapenthes, was
born to him of a bondwoman, for the gods granted
Helen no more children after she had borne
Hermione, who was fair as golden Aphrodite
herself.</p>
<p n="104" start-line="4.15" end-line="4.19">[15] So they feasted throughout the big palace
with its high ceilings, <seg rend="subscript"
>16</seg> both the neighbors and the kinsmen of
glorious Menelaos, <seg rend="subscript"
>17</seg> and they were feeling delight [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">terpesthai</foreign>]; in their
midst sang-and-danced [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>melpesthai</foreign>] a divine singer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aoidos</foreign>], <seg
rend="subscript">18</seg>playing on the special
lyre [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kubistētēre</foreign>]
among them <seg rend="subscript">19</seg>were
swirling as he led [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">molpē</foreign>] in
their midst.</p>
<p n="105" start-line="4.20" end-line="4.29">[20] The hero Telemachus and the shining son of
Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon
powerful Eteoneus, servant to glorious Menelaos
came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying
back into the house to tell his Master. [25] He
went close up to him and said, “Menelaos, dear to
Zeus, there are some strangers come here, two men,
who look like sons of Zeus. What are we to do?
Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to
find friends elsewhere as they best can?”</p>
<p n="106" start-line="4.30" end-line="4.36">[30] Fair-haired Menelaos was very angry and
said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethoös, you never used
to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton.
Take their horses out, of course, and show the
strangers in that they may have supper; you and I
have stayed often enough at other people’s houses
before we got back here, where the gods [35] grant
that we may rest in peace henceforward.”</p>
<p n="107" start-line="4.37" end-line="4.48">So Eteoneus bustled back and bade other
servants come with him. They took their sweating
steeds from under the yoke, [40] made them fast to
the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and
barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against
the end wall of the courtyard. <seg
rend="subscript">43</seg> They [=Telemachus and
Peisistratos] were escorted inside the heavenly
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">theion</foreign>]
palace. Seeing what they were seeing, <seg
rend="subscript">44</seg> they were filled with
awe [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thauma</foreign>] as
they proceeded through the palace of the king,
that man whose origins are celestial. [45] There
was a gleam [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aiglē</foreign>] there, which was like the gleam
of the sun or the moon, <seg rend="subscript"
>46 </seg>spreading throughout that palace famed
for its high ceilings, that home of radiant
Menelaos. <seg rend="subscript">47</seg> But then,
after they had feasted their eyes on what they
saw, they went into the bath room and washed
themselves.</p>
<p n="108" start-line="4.49" end-line="4.58">When the servants had washed them and anointed
them with oil, [50] they brought them woolen
cloaks and khitons, and the two took their seats
by the side of Menelaos, son of Atreus. A
maidservant brought them water in a beautiful
golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for
them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean
table beside them. [55] An upper servant brought
them bread, and offered them many good things of
what there was in the house, while the carver
fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set
cups of gold by their side.</p>
<p n="109" start-line="4.59" end-line="4.64">Fair-haired Menelaos then greeted them saying,
[60] “Eat up, and welcome; when you have finished
supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of
such men as you cannot have been lost. You must be
descended from a line of scepter-bearing kings,
for poor people do not have such sons as you
are.”</p>
<p n="110" start-line="4.65" end-line="4.75">[65] Then he handed them a piece of fat roast
loin, which had been set near him as being a prime
part, and they laid their hands on the good things
that were before them; as soon as they had had
enough to eat and drink, Telemachus said to the
son of Nestor, with [70] his head so close that no
one might hear, <seg rend="subscript">71</seg> “I
want you to notice something, son of Nestor, you
who are so dear to my heart: <seg rend="subscript"
>72</seg> notice the flash [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">steropē</foreign>] of bronze
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">khalkos</foreign>] as
its light pervades the echoing hall <seg
rend="subscript">73</seg> and also the flash of
gold and of electrum and of silver and of
ivory. <seg rend="subscript">74 </seg>I’m guessing
that Zeus, who lives on Olympus, has such a hall
inside his palace, [75] and he would have as many
indescribable things as are here. A sense of holy
awe takes hold of me as I look at these
things.”</p>
<p n="111" start-line="4.76" end-line="4.112">Menelaos of the fair hair overheard him and
said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own with
Zeus, for his house and everything about him is
immortal; but among mortal men— [80] well, there
may be another who has as much wealth as I have,
or there may not; but at all events I have
traveled much and have undergone much hardship,
for it was nearly eight years before I could get
home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia
and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians,
the Sidonians, and the Erembians, [85] and to
Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they
are born, and the sheep bear lambs three times a
year. Every one in that country, whether master or
man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk,
for the ewes yield all the year round. [90] But
while I was traveling and getting great riches
among these people, my brother was secretly and
shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his
wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being
lord of all this wealth. Whoever your parents may
be they must have told you about all this, [95]
and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately
dwelling fully and magnificently furnished. Would
that I had only a third of what I now have so that
I had stayed at home, and all those were living
who perished on the plain of Troy, far from
horse-pasturing Argos. [100] I often grieve, as I
sit here in my house, for one and all of them. At
times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I
leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and
one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I
may, I do so [105] for one man more than for them
all. I cannot even think of him without loathing
both food and sleep, so miserable does he make
me, <seg rend="subscript">106</seg> since none of
the Achaeans struggled so much <seg
rend="subscript">107</seg> as Odysseus struggled
and achieved. For him there would be <seg
rend="subscript">108</seg> cares in the future,
whereas I would have an unforgettable grief
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos alaston</foreign>]
always, for he has been gone a long time, and we
know not [110] whether he is alive or dead. His
old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and
his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him an
infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his
account.”</p>
<p n="112" start-line="4.113" end-line="4.119">Thus spoke Menelaos, and the heart of
Telemachus yearned as he turned his thoughts to
his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard
him thus [115] mentioned, so that he held his
cloak before his face with both hands. When
Menelaos saw this he doubted whether to let him
choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at
once and find what it was all about.</p>
<p n="113" start-line="4.120" end-line="4.137">[120] While he was thus in two minds Helen came
down from her high-vaulted and perfumed room,
looking as lovely as Artemis of the golden distaff
herself. Adraste brought her a seat, Alkippe a
soft woolen rug, [125] while Phylo fetched her the
silver work-box which Alkandra, wife of Polybos,
had given her. Polybos lived in Egyptian Thebes,
which is the richest city in the whole world; he
gave Menelaos two baths, both of pure silver, two
tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all
this, [130] his wife gave Helen some beautiful
presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver
work-box that ran on wheels, with a gold band
round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by her
side, full of fine spun yarn, [135] and a distaff
charged with violet colored wool was laid upon the
top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet
upon the footstool, and began to question her
husband.</p>
<p n="114" start-line="4.138" end-line="4.146">“Do we know, Menelaos, beloved of Zeus,” said
she, “the names of these strangers who have come
to visit us? [140] Shall I guess right or wrong?
But I cannot help saying what I think. Never yet
have I seen either man or woman so like somebody
else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what
to think) as this young man is like Telemachus,
whom great-hearted Odysseus left as a baby behind
him, [145] when you Achaeans went to Troy with
battle in your hearts, on account of my most
shameless self.”</p>
<p n="115" start-line="4.147" end-line="4.154">“My dear wife,” replied fair-haired Menelaos,
“I see the likeness just as you do. His hands and
feet are just like Odysseus’; [150] so is his
hair, with the shape of his head and the
expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was
talking about Odysseus, and saying how much he had
suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes,
and he hid his face in his mantle.”</p>
<p n="116" start-line="4.155" end-line="4.167">[155] Then Peisistratos, son of Nestor, said,
“Menelaos, son of Atreus, you are right in
thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he
is very modest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sōphrōn</foreign>], and is ashamed in
his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign> to
come here and begin opening up discourse [160]
with one whose conversation is so divinely
interesting as your own. My father, Nestor the
charioteer of Gerenia, sent me to escort him here,
for he wanted to know whether you could give him
any counsel or suggestion. A son has always
trouble at home when his father [165] has gone
away leaving him without supporters; and this is
how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is
absent, and there is no one among his own <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign> to stand by
him.”</p>
<p n="117" start-line="4.168" end-line="4.182">“Bless my heart,” replied fair-haired Menelaos;
“then I am receiving a visit from the son of a
very dear friend, [170] who suffered much hardship
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] for my
sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with
most marked distinction when the gods had granted
us a safe return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] from beyond the seas. I should
have founded a city for him in Argos, and built
him [175] a house. I should have made him leave
Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his
people, and should have ransacked for them some
one of the neighboring cities that are subject to
me. We should thus have seen one another
continually, [180] and nothing but death could
have interrupted so close and happy an
intercourse. I suppose, however, that the gods
grudged us such good fortune, for it has made
him, <seg rend="subscript">182</seg> that wretched
one, the only one who has not come home.”</p>
<p n="118" start-line="4.183" end-line="4.189">Thus did he speak, and his words set them all
to weeping. Helen of Argos, daughter of Zeus,
wept, Telemachus [185] wept, and so did Menelaos
the son of Atreus, nor could Nestor’s son
Peisistratos keep his eyes from filling, when he
remembered his dear brother stately Antilokhos
whom the son of bright Dawn had killed. Then he
said to Menelaos,</p>
<p n="119" start-line="4.190" end-line="4.202">[190] “Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to
talk about you at home, told me you were a person
of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it
be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond
of crying while I am getting my supper. Morning
will come [195] in due course, and in the forenoon
I care not how much I cry for those that are dead
and gone. This is all we can do for the poor
things. We can only shave our heads for them and
wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother
who died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man
[200] there; you are sure to have known him—his
name was Antilokhos; I never set eyes upon him
myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet
of foot and in fight valiant.”</p>
<p n="120" start-line="4.203" end-line="4.215">“Your discretion, my friend,” answered
fair-haired Menelaos, [205] “is beyond your years.
It is plain you take after your father. One can
soon see when a man is son to one whom Zeus grants
blessedness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbos</foreign>] both as regards wife and
offspring—and he has blessed Nestor from first to
last all his days, [210] giving him a green old
age in his own house, with sons about him who are
both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end
therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our
supper again. Let water be poured over our hands.
Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully
[215] in the morning.”</p>
<p n="121" start-line="4.216" end-line="4.218">Then Asphalion, one of the servants, poured
water over their hands and they laid their hands
on the good things that were before them.</p>
<p n="122" start-line="4.219" end-line="4.234">Then Zeus’ daughter Helen turned her thoughts
to another matter. [220] She [= Helen] put a drug

When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had
told the servants to serve the wine round, she
said:</p>
<p n="123" start-line="4.235" end-line="4.264">[235] “Menelaos, son of Atreus, dear to Zeus,
and you my good friends, sons of honorable men
(which is as Zeus wills, for he is the giver both
of good and evil, and can do what he
chooses). <seg rend="subscript">238</seg> Sit now
and dine in the palace, and be entertained <seg
rend="subscript">239</seg> by the stories. For the
things that I will say in proper order are
appropriate. [240] I could not possibly tell of or
name <seg rend="subscript">241</seg> all the
struggles that are the share of the enduring
Odysseus, <seg rend="subscript">242</seg> but I
will tell of this one thing that he did and
endured— <seg rend="subscript">243</seg>—that man
of power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kratos</foreign>] —in the district of Troy, where
you Achaeans suffered pains [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pēma</foreign> plural]. feast here
as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in
season. [240] I cannot indeed name every single
one of the exploits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>] of enduring Odysseus, but I can
say what he did when he was in the Trojan <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>, and you Achaeans
were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered
himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself
[245] all in rags, and entered the enemy’s city
looking like a menial or a beggar, quite different
from how he looked when he was among his own
people. In this disguise he entered the city of
Troy, and no one said anything to him. [250] I
alone recognized him and began to question him,
but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I
had washed and anointed him and had given him
clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not
to betray him to the Trojans [255] till he had got
safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he
explained to me the whole plan [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of the Achaeans.
He killed many Trojans and got much information
before he reached the Argive camp, for all which
things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for
my own part [260] I was glad, for my heart was
beginning to long after my home, and I was unhappy
about the wrong [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>atē</foreign>] that Aphrodite had done me in
taking me over there, away from my country, my
girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed
by no means deficient either in looks or
understanding.”</p>
<p n="124" start-line="4.265" end-line="4.289">[265] Then fair-haired Menelaos said, “All that
you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I
have traveled much, and have learned the plans
and <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos </foreign>of
many a hero, [270] but I have never seen such
another man as enduring Odysseus. What endurance
too, and what courage he displayed within the
wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the
Argives were lying in wait to bring death and
destruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you
came up to us; [275] some superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] who
wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to
it and you had Deiphobos the godlike with you.
Three times did you go all round our hiding place
and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own
name, <seg rend="subscript">279</seg> making your
voice like [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>eïskein</foreign>] the voices of their wives.
[280] Diomedes, great Odysseus, and I from our
seats inside heard what a noise you made. Diomedes
and I could not make up our minds whether to
spring out then and there, or to answer you from
inside, but Odysseus held us all in check, [285]
so we sat quite still, all except Antiklos, who
was beginning to answer you, when Odysseus clapped
his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them
there. It was this that saved us all, for he
muzzled Antiklos till Athena took you away again.”
[290] “How sad,” exclaimed the spirited
Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save
him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir,
be pleased to send us all to bed, that we may lie
down [295] and enjoy the blessed boon of
sleep.”</p>
<p n="125" start-line="4.290" end-line="4.305">Then Helen of Argos told the maid servants to
set beds in the room that was in the gatehouse,
and to make them with good red rugs, and spread
coverlets on the top of them with woolen cloaks
for the guests to wear. So the maids [300] went
out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which
a man-servant presently conducted the strangers.
Thus, then, did the hero Telemachus and glorious
Peisistratos sleep there in the forecourt, while
the son of Atreus lay in an inner room [305] with
lovely Helen by his side.</p>
<p n="126" start-line="4.306" end-line="4.311">When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, Menelaos rose and dressed himself. He
bound his sandals on to his comely feet, [310]
girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his
room looking like an immortal god. Then, taking a
seat near Telemachus he said:</p>
<p n="127" start-line="4.312" end-line="4.314">“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this
long sea voyage to shining Lacedaemon? Are you on
public or private business? Tell me all about
it.”</p>
<p n="128" start-line="4.315" end-line="4.331">[315] “I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus,
“to see if you can tell me anything about my
father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my
fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full
of miscreants who in overweening <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign> [320] keep
killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the
pretence of wooing my mother. Therefore, I am
suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me
about my father’s melancholy end, whether you saw
it with your own eyes, or heard it from [325] some
other traveler; for he was a man born to trouble.
Do not soften things out of any pity for myself,
but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw.
If my brave father Odysseus ever did you loyal
service either by word or deed, [330] when you
Achaeans were harassed in the <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign> of the Trojans,
bear it in mind now as in my favor and tell me
truly all.”</p>
<p n="129" start-line="4.332" end-line="4.350">Menelaos on hearing this was very much shocked.
“So,” he exclaimed, “these cowards would usurp a
brave man’s bed? [335] A hind might as well lay
her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then
go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy
dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will
make short work with the pair of them— [340] and
so will Odysseus with these suitors. By father
Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, <seg rend="subscript"
>342</seg> being such a man as the one who [i.e.
Odysseus], in well-founded Lesbos, <seg
rend="subscript">343</seg> in rivalry stood up and
wrestled Philomeleides <seg rend="subscript"
>344</seg> and threw him down mightily, and all
the Achaeans were glad— [345] if he is still such
and were to come near these suitors, they would
have a swift doom and a sorry wedding. As regards
your questions, however, I will not prevaricate
nor deceive you, [350] but will tell you without
concealment all that the old man of the sea told
me.</p>
<p n="130" start-line="4.351" end-line="4.366"><seg rend="subscript">351</seg> In Egypt did
they hold me up, the gods did, though I sorely
wanted to make a homecoming [<foreign

[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">deuro</foreign> = at
home, where I am speaking now]. <seg
rend="subscript">352</seg> Yes, they held me up,
since [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">epei</foreign>] I
did not perform for them a perfect sacrifice of
one hundred cattle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hekatombai</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>353</seg> The gods always wanted their protocols
to be kept in mind. Now off Egypt, about as far as
a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze
behind her, there is an island [355] called
Pharos—it has a good harbor from which vessels can
get out into open sea when they have taken in
water— [360] and the gods becalmed me twenty days
without so much as a breath of fair wind to help
me forward <seg rend="subscript">363</seg> and by
now all the food would have wasted away, and along
with it the strength of the men, if a goddess had
not taken pity upon me and saved me [365] in the
person of Eidothea, daughter to mighty Proteus,
the old man of the sea, for she had taken a great
fancy to me.</p>
<p n="131" start-line="4.367" end-line="4.374">She came to me one day when I was by myself, as
I often was, for the men used to go with their
barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope of
catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs
of hunger. [370] ‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it seems
to me that you like starving in this way—at any
rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you
stick here day after day, without even trying to
get away though your men are dying by inches.’</p>
<p n="132" start-line="4.375" end-line="4.381">[375] ‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of
the goddesses you may happen to be, that I am not
staying here of my own accord, but must have
offended the gods that live in the sky. Tell me,
therefore, for the gods know everything: which
[380] of the immortals it is that is hindering me
in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the
sea so as to reach my home [<foreign

<p n="133" start-line="4.382" end-line="4.393">‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all
quite clear to you. There is an old ever truthful
immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and
whose name is Proteus. [385] He is an Egyptian,
and people say he is my father; he is Poseidon’s
head man and knows every inch of ground all over
the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him and
hold him tight, he will tell you about your
voyage, what courses you are to take, [390] and
how you are to sail the sea so as to have a
homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>]. He will also tell you,
illustrious one, if you so will, all that has been
going on at your house both good and bad, while
you have been away on your long and dangerous
journey.’</p>
<p n="134" start-line="4.394" end-line="4.397">‘Can you show me,’ said I, [395] ‘some strategy
by means of which I may catch this old god without
his suspecting it and finding me out? For a
superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] is not easily caught—not by a
mortal man.’</p>
<p n="135" start-line="4.398" end-line="4.410">‘Stranger,’ said she, shining among goddesses,
‘I will make it all quite clear to you. [400]
About the time when the sun shall have reached the
mid-point in the sky, the ever-truthful old man of
the sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by
the West wind that furs the water over his head.
As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes
to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals—
[Halosydne’s chickens as they call them]— [405]
come up also from the gray sea, and go to sleep in
shoals all round him; and a very strong and
fish-like smell do they bring with them. Early
tomorrow morning I will take you to this place and
will lay you in ambush. Pick out [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>], therefore, the
three best men you have in your fleet, [410] and I
will tell you all the tricks that the old man will
play you.</p>
<p n="136" start-line="4.411" end-line="4.424">First he will look over all his seals, and
count them; then, when he has seen them and
tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to
sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep.
The moment you see that he is asleep seize him;
[415] put forth all your strength [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] and hold him fast,
for he will do his very utmost to get away from
you. He will turn himself into every kind of
creature that goes upon the earth, and will become
also both fire and water; but you must hold him
fast and grip him tighter and tighter, [420] till
he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he
was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may
slacken your hold [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>] and let him go; and you can ask
him which of the gods it is that is angry with
you, and what you must do to have a homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] over
the fishy sea.’</p>
<p n="137" start-line="4.425" end-line="4.446">[425] Having so said she dived under the waves,
whereon I turned back to the place where my ships
were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was
clouded with care as I went along. When I reached
my ship we got supper ready, for night was
falling, [430] and camped down upon the beach.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, I took the three men on whose prowess of
all kinds I could most rely, and went along by the
sea-side, praying heartily to the gods. [435]
Meanwhile the goddess fetched me up four seal
skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just
skinned, for she meant to play a trick upon her
father. Then she dug four pits for us to lie in,
and sat down to wait till we should come up. When
we were close to her, [440] she made us lie down
in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal
skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would have
been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy
seals was most distressing—who would go to bed
with a sea monster if he could help it?—but here,
too, the goddess helped us, and thought of
something that gave us great relief, [445] for she
put some ambrosia under each man’s nostrils, which
was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the
seals.</p>
<p n="138" start-line="4.447" end-line="4.463">We waited the whole morning and made the best
of it, watching the seals come up in hundreds to
bask upon the sea shore, [450] till at noon the
old man of the sea came up too, and when he had
found his fat seals he went over them and counted
them. We were among the first he counted, and he
never suspected any guile, but laid himself down
to sleep as soon as he had done counting. Then we
rushed upon him with a shout and [455] seized him;
on which he began at once with his old tricks, and
changed himself first into a lion with a great
mane; then all of a sudden he became a dragon, a
leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was
running water, and then again directly he was a
tree, but we stuck to him and never lost hold,
[460] till at last the cunning old creature became
distressed, and said, ‘Which of the gods was it,
Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for
snaring me and seizing me against my will? What do
you want?’</p>
<p n="139" start-line="4.464" end-line="4.470">‘You know that yourself, old man,’ I answered.
[465] ‘You will gain nothing by trying to put me
off. It is because I have been kept so long in
this island, and see no sign of my being able to
get away. I am losing all heart; tell me, then,
for you gods know everything, which of the
immortals it is that is hindering me, [470] and
tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to have
a homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>]?’</p>
<p n="140" start-line="4.471" end-line="4.480">‘Then,’ he said, ‘if you would finish your
voyage and get home quickly, you must offer
sacrifices to Zeus and to the rest of the gods
before embarking; [475] for it is decreed that you
shall not get back to your friends, and to your
own house, till you have returned to the sky-fed
stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the
immortal gods that reign in the sky. [480] When
you have done this they will let you finish your
voyage.’</p>
<p n="141" start-line="4.481" end-line="4.490">I was broken-hearted when I heard that I must
go back all that long and terrifying voyage to
Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, [485] ‘I will do
all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now
tell me, and tell me true, whether all the
Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we
set sail from Troy have got home safely, or
whether any one of them came to a bad end either
on board his own ship [490] or among his friends
when the days of his fighting were done.’</p>
<p n="142" start-line="4.491" end-line="4.511">‘Son of Atreus,’ he answered, ‘why ask me? You
had better not know my mind [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], for your eyes
will surely fill when you have heard my story.
[495] Many of those about whom you ask are dead
and gone, but many still remain, and only two of
the chief men among the bronze-armored Achaeans
perished during their return home. As for what
happened on the field of battle—you were there
yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,
alive, but hindered from returning [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]. Ajax was
wrecked, [500] for Poseidon drove him on to the
great rocks of Gyrai; nevertheless, he let him get
safe out of the water, and in spite of all
Athena’s hatred he would have escaped death, if he
had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the
gods could not drown him even though they had
tried to do so, [505] and when Poseidon heard this
large talk, he seized his trident in his two
brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrai in two
pieces. The base remained where it was, but the
part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into
the sea [510] and carried Ajax with it; so he
drank salt water and was drowned.</p>
<p n="143" start-line="4.512" end-line="4.523"><seg rend="subscript">512</seg> But your
brother [= Agamemnon] escaped from the forces of
destruction, and he slipped away <seg
rend="subscript">513</seg> in his hollow ships.
Hera had saved [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sōzein</foreign>] him. But when he was just about
to reach the high promontory of Malea, [515] a
gust of wind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thuella</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
>516</seg> carried him, heavily groaning, over the
fishy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ikhthuoeis</foreign>] sea [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] and drove him to
the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but
where Aegisthus was then living. By and by,
however, it seemed as though he was to have his
return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>], [520] safe after all, for the
gods backed the wind into its old quarter and they
reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed his native
soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in
his own country.</p>
<p n="144" start-line="4.524" end-line="4.537">Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept
always on the watch, and to whom he had [525]
promised two talents of gold. This man had been
looking out for a whole year to make sure that
Agamemnon did not give him the slip and prepare
war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go
by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once began
to lay a plot for him. [530] He picked [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] twenty of his
bravest warriors from the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> and placed them in ambuscade on
one side of the hall, while on the opposite side
he prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots
and horsemen to Agamemnon, and invited him to the
feast, but he meant foul play. [535] He got him
there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was
awaiting him, and killed him when the banquet was
over as though he were butchering an ox in the
shambles; not one of Agamemnon’s followers was
left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus’, but they
were all killed there in the halls.’</p>
<p n="145" start-line="4.538" end-line="4.547">Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as
I heard him. I sat down upon the sands and wept; I
felt as though I could no longer [540] bear to
live nor look upon the light of the sun.
Presently, when I had had my fill of weeping and
writhing upon the ground, the ever-truthful old
man of the sea said, ‘Son of Atreus, do not waste
any more time in crying so bitterly; it can do no
manner of good; find your way home [545] as fast
as ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and
even though Orestes anticipates you in killing
him, you may yet come in for his funeral.’</p>
<p n="146" start-line="4.548" end-line="4.553">Then I took comfort in my my heart and bold
spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>]
in spite of all my sorrow, [550] and said, ‘I
know, then, about these two; tell me, therefore,
about the third man of whom you spoke; is he still
alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? Or is
he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve
me.’</p>
<p n="147" start-line="4.554" end-line="4.569">‘The third man,’ he answered, [555] ‘is
Odysseus, son of Laertes, who dwells in Ithaca. I
can see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the
house of the nymph Kalypsō, who is keeping him
prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for he has
no ships nor sailors [560] to take him over the
sea. As for your own end, Menelaos, fostered son
of Zeus, you shall not die in horse-pasturing
Argos, but the gods will take you to the Elysian
plain, which is at the ends of the world. There
fair-haired Rhadamanthus [565] reigns, and men
lead an easier life than any where else in the
world, for in Elysium there is no snow, nor heavy
winter-storm, nor rain, <seg rend="subscript"
>567</seg> but the Okeanos sends up the gusts of
shrill-blowing Zephyros <seg rend="subscript"
>568</seg> at all times, so as to reanimate men.
This will happen to you because you have married
Helen, and are [570] Zeus’ son-in-law.’</p>
<p n="148" start-line="4.570" end-line="4.586">As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I
turned back to the ships with my companions, and
my heart was clouded with care as I went along.
When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for
night was falling, [575] and camped down upon the
beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered
Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water,
and put our masts and sails within them; then we
went on board ourselves, took our seats on the
benches, [580] and smote the gray sea with our
oars. I again stationed my ships in the sky-fed
stream of Egypt, and offered hecatombs that were
full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased the
anger of the gods, I raised a tomb to the memory
of Agamemnon that his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign> [585] might be inextinguishable,
after which I had a quick passage home, for the
gods sent me a fair wind.</p>
<p n="149" start-line="4.587" end-line="4.592">And now for yourself—stay here some ten or
twelve days longer, and I will then speed you on
your way. I will make you a noble [590] present of
a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a
beautiful chalice that so long as you live you may
think of me whenever you make a drink-offering to
the immortal gods.”</p>
<p n="150" start-line="4.593" end-line="4.608">“Son of Atreus,” replied the spirited
Telemachus, “do not press me to stay longer; [595]
I should be contented to remain with you for
another twelve months; I find your conversation so
delightful that I should never once wish myself at
home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left
at Pylos are already impatient, and you are
detaining me from them. [600] As for any present
you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that
it should be a piece of plate. I will take no
horses back with me to Ithaca, but will leave them
to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat
ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as
also meadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats
with their white and spreading ears; [605] whereas
in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor
racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats
than horses, and I like it the better for that.
None of our islands have much level ground,
suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.”</p>
<p n="151" start-line="4.609" end-line="4.619">Menelaos smiled [610] and took Telemachus’ hand
within his own. “What you say,” said he, “shows
that you come of good family. I both can, and
will, make this exchange for you, by giving you
the finest and most precious piece of plate in all
my house. [615] It is a mixing-bowl by Hephaistos’
own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is
inlaid with gold. The hero Phaidimos, king of the
Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit
which I paid him when I returned there on my
homeward journey. I will make you a present of
it.”</p>
<p n="152" start-line="4.620" end-line="4.624">[620] Thus did they converse as guests kept
coming to the king’s house. They brought sheep and
wine, while their wives had put up bread for them
to take with them; so they were busy cooking their
dinners in the courts.</p>
<p n="153" start-line="4.625" end-line="4.631">[625] Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs
or aiming with spears at a mark on the leveled
ground in front of Odysseus’ house, and were
behaving with all their old <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>. Antinoos and
Eurymakhos, who were their ringleaders and much
the foremost in <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>among them all, were sitting
together [630] when Noemon, son of Phronios, came
up and said to Antinoos,</p>
<p n="154" start-line="4.632" end-line="4.637">“Have we any idea, Antinoos, on what day
Telemachus returns from Pylos? He has a ship of
mine, and I want it, [635] to cross over to Elis:
I have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule
foals by their side not yet broken in, and I want
to bring one of them over here and break him.”</p>
<p n="155" start-line="4.638" end-line="4.647">They were astounded when they heard this, for
they had been sure that Telemachus had not gone to
the city of Neleus. They thought he was only away
somewhere [640] on the farms, and was with the
sheep, or with the swineherd; so Antinoos, son of
Eupeithes, said, “When did he go? Tell me truly,
and what young men did he take with him? Were they
freemen or his own bondsmen—for he might manage
that too? [645] Tell me also, did you let him have
the ship of your own free will because he asked
you, or did he take it by force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] without your
leave?”</p>
<p n="156" start-line="4.648" end-line="4.656">“I lent it him,” answered Noemon. “What else
could I do [650] when a man of his position said
he was in a difficulty and asked me to oblige him?
I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went
with him they were the best young men we have in
the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>, and
I saw Mentor go on board as captain—or some god
who was exactly like him. [655] I cannot
understand it, for I saw splendid Mentor here
myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then
setting out for Pylos.”</p>
<p n="157" start-line="4.657" end-line="4.662">Noemon then went back to his father’s house,
but Antinoos and Eurymakhos were very angry. They
told the others to leave off competing [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], and to come and
sit down along with themselves. [660] When they
came, Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, spoke in anger.
His heart was black with rage, and his eyes
flashed fire as he said:</p>
<p n="158" start-line="4.663" end-line="4.672">“Skies above! This voyage of Telemachus is a
very serious matter; we had made sure that it
would come to nothing, [665] but the young man has
got away in spite of us, and with a crew picked
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] from
the best of the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>, too. He will be giving us
trouble presently; may Zeus destroy him with
violence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>]
before he is full grown. Find me a ship,
therefore, with a crew of twenty men, [670] and I
will lie in wait for him in the straits between
Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the day that he
set out to try and get news of his father.”</p>
<p n="159" start-line="4.673" end-line="4.674">Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his
saying; they then all of them went inside the
buildings.</p>
<p n="160" start-line="4.675" end-line="4.695">[675] It was not long before Penelope came to
know what the suitors were plotting; for a
manservant, Medon, overheard them from outside the
outer court as they were laying their schemes
within, and went to tell his mistress. [680] As he
crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:
“Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for?
Is it to tell the maids to leave their godlike
master’s business and cook dinner for them? I wish
they [685] may neither woo nor dine henceforward,
neither here nor anywhere else, but let this be
the very last time, for the waste you all make of
my high-spirited son’s estate. Did not your
fathers tell you when you were children how good
Odysseus had been to them—never doing anything
high-handed, [690] nor speaking harshly to anybody
in the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>?
Such is the justice [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikē</foreign>] of divine kings: they may take a
fancy to one man and dislike another, but Odysseus
never did an unjust thing by anybody—which shows
what bad hearts you have, [695] and that there is
no such thing as gratitude [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] left in this
world.”</p>
<p n="161" start-line="4.696" end-line="4.702">Then Medon, a man of spirited mind said, “I
wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are
plotting something much more dreadful now—may the
gods frustrate their design. [700] They are going
to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home
from Pylos and glorious Lacedaemon, where he has
been to get news of his father.”</p>
<p n="162" start-line="4.703" end-line="4.710">Then Penelope’s heart sank within her, and for
a long time she was speechless; her eyes [705]
filled with tears, and she could find no
utterance. At last, however, she said, “Why did my
son leave me? What business had he to go sailing
off in fast-running ships that make long voyages
over the ocean like sea-horses? [710] Does he want
to die without leaving any one behind him to keep
up his name?”</p>
<p n="163" start-line="4.711" end-line="4.714">“I do not know,” answered Medon, “whether some
god set him on to it, or whether he went on his
own impulse to see if he could find out if his
father was dead, or alive and on his way home
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="164" start-line="4.715" end-line="4.721">[715] Then he went downstairs again, leaving
Penelope in an agony of grief [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]. There were
plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart
for sitting on any one of them; she could only
fling herself on the floor of her own room and
cry; whereon all the maids in the house, [720]
both old and young, gathered round her and began
to cry too, till at last in a transport of sorrow
she exclaimed,</p>
<p n="165" start-line="4.722" end-line="4.741">“My dears, the gods have been pleased to try me
with more affliction than any other woman of my
age and country. First I lost my brave and
lion-hearted husband, [725] who had every good
quality [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>]
under the sky, and whose <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign> was great over all Hellas and
middle Argos; <seg rend="subscript">727</seg> But
now the gusts of wind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thuellai</foreign>] have abducted my beloved son,
without my having heard one word about his leaving
home. You hussies, there was not one of you would
so much as think [730] of giving me a call out of
my bed, though all of you very well knew when he
was starting. If I had known he meant taking this
voyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter
how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse
behind him—one or other. Now, however, [735] go
some of you and call old man Dolios, who was given
me by my father on my marriage, and who is my
gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything
to Laertes, who may be able to hit on some plan
[740] for enlisting public sympathy on our side,
as against those who hanker <seg rend="subscript"
>741</seg>to destroy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>pthinein</foreign>] his progeny [i.e., of
Laertes] which is also that of godlike
Odysseus.”</p>
<p n="166" start-line="4.742" end-line="4.757">Then the dear old nurse Eurykleia said, “You
may kill me, Madam, or let me live on in your
house, whichever you please, but I will tell you
the real truth. [745] I knew all about it, and
gave him everything he wanted in the way of bread
and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that
I would not tell you anything for some ten or
twelve days, unless you asked or happened to hear
of his having gone, for he did not want you to
spoil your beauty by crying. [750] And now, Madam,
wash your face, change your dress, and go upstairs
with your maids to offer prayers to Athena,
daughter of Aegis-bearing Zeus, for she can save
him even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not
trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough already.
[755] Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate
the lineage of the son of Arkeisios so much, but
there will be a son left to come up after him, and
inherit both the house and the fair fields that
lie far all round it.”</p>
<p n="167" start-line="4.758" end-line="4.761">With these words she made her mistress leave
off crying, and dried the tears from her eyes.
Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, [760]
and went upstairs with her maids. She then put
some bruised barley into a basket and began
praying to Athena.</p>
<p n="168" start-line="4.762" end-line="4.766">“Hear me,” she cried, “Daughter of
Aegis-bearing Zeus, the one who cannot be worn
down. If ever resourceful Odysseus while he was
here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or
heifer, [765] bear it in mind now as in my favor,
and save my darling son from the villainy of the
suitors.”</p>
<p n="169" start-line="4.767" end-line="4.769">She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess
heard her prayer; meanwhile the suitors were
clamorous throughout the covered hall, and one of
them said:</p>
<p n="170" start-line="4.770" end-line="4.771">[770] “The queen is preparing for her marriage
with one or other of us. Little does she dream
that her son has now been doomed to die.”</p>
<p n="171" start-line="4.772" end-line="4.777">This was what they said, but they did not know
what was going to happen. Then Antinoos said,
“Comrades, let there be no loud [775] talking,
lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up
and do that in silence, about which we are all of
a mind.”</p>
<p n="172" start-line="4.778" end-line="4.786">He then chose [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>krinein</foreign>] twenty men, and they went down
to their ship and to the sea side; [780] they drew
the vessel into the water and got her mast and
sails inside her; they bound the oars to the
thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in
due course, and spread the white sails aloft,
while their fine servants brought them their
armor. [785] Then they made the ship fast a little
way out, came on shore again, got their suppers,
and waited till night should fall.</p>
<p n="173" start-line="4.787" end-line="4.794">But circumspect Penelope lay in her own room
upstairs unable to eat or drink, and wondering
whether her brave son would escape, [790] or be
overpowered by the wicked suitors. Like a lioness
caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming her in
on every side she thought and thought till she
sank into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of
thought and motion.</p>
<p n="174" start-line="4.795" end-line="4.803">[795] Then owl-vision goddess Athena turned her
thoughts to another matter, and made a vision in
the likeness of Penelope’s sister, Iphthime,
daughter of great-hearted Ikarios, who had married
Eumelos and lived in Pherai. She told the vision
to go to the house of godlike Odysseus, [800] and
to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into
her room by the hole through which the thong went
for pulling the door to, and hovered over her
head, saying,</p>
<p n="175" start-line="4.804" end-line="4.807">“You are asleep, Penelope: [805] the gods who
live at ease will not suffer you to weep and be so
sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will
yet come back to you.”</p>
<p n="176" start-line="4.808" end-line="4.823">Circumspect Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly
at the gates of dreamland, answered, [810]
“Sister, why have you come here? You do not come
very often, but I suppose that is because you live
such a long way off. Am I, then, to leave off
crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that
torture me? I, who have lost my brave and
lion-hearted husband, [815] who had every good
quality [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>]
under the sky, and whose <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign> was great over all Hellas and
middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off
on board of a ship—a foolish man who has never
been used to undergoing ordeals [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ponoi</foreign>], nor to going
about among gatherings of men. I am even more
anxious about him than about my husband; [820] I
am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest
something should happen to him, either from the
people in the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> where he has gone, or at sea, for
he has many enemies who are plotting against him,
and are bent on killing him before he can return
home.”</p>
<p n="177" start-line="4.824" end-line="4.829">Then the vision said, [825] “Take heart, and be
not so much dismayed. There is one gone with him
whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand
by his side, I mean Athena; it is she who has
compassion upon you, and who has sent me to bear
you this message.”</p>
<p n="178" start-line="4.830" end-line="4.834">[830] “Then,” said circumspect Penelope, “if
you are a god or have been sent here by divine
commission, tell me also about that other unhappy
one—is he still alive, or is he already dead and
in the house of Hādēs?”</p>
<p n="179" start-line="4.835" end-line="4.837">[835] And the vision said, “I shall not tell
you for certain whether he is alive or dead, and
there is no use in idle conversation.”</p>
<p n="180" start-line="4.838" end-line="4.841">Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the
door and was dissipated into thin air; [840] but
Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and
comforted, so vivid had been her dream.</p>
<p n="181" start-line="4.842" end-line="4.847">Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed
their ways over the sea, intent on murdering
Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called
Asteris, of no great size, [845] in mid channel
between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbor on
either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then
the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 5</head>
<p n="182" start-line="5.1" end-line="5.6" rend="no-indent">And now, as Dawn rose from her
couch beside haughty Tithonos—harbinger of light
alike to mortals and immortals—the gods met in
council and with them, Zeus the lord of thunder,
who is their king. [5] Then Athena began to tell
them of the many sufferings of Odysseus, for she
pitied him away there in the house of the nymph
Kalypsō.</p>
<p n="183" start-line="5.7" end-line="5.20">“Father Zeus,” said she, “and all you other
gods that live in everlasting bliss, I hope there
may never be such a thing as a kind and
well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will
govern equitably. [10] I hope they will be all
henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one
of his subjects who has not forgotten godlike
Odysseus, who ruled them as though he were their
father. There he is, lying in great pain in an
island where dwells the nymph Kalypsō, who will
not let him go; [15] and he cannot get back to his
own country, for he can find neither ships nor
sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore,
wicked people are now trying to murder his only
son Telemachus, [20] who is coming home from Pylos
and glorious Lacedaemon, where he has been to see
if he can get news of his father.”</p>
<p n="184" start-line="5.21" end-line="5.27">“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied
her father. “Did you not send him there yourself,
because you thought [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] it would help Odysseus to get
home and punish the suitors? [25] Besides, you are
perfectly able to protect Telemachus, and to see
him safely home again, while the suitors have to
come hurrying back without having killed him.”</p>
<p n="185" start-line="5.28" end-line="5.42">When he had thus spoken, he said to his beloved
son Hermes, “Hermes, you are our messenger, [30]
go therefore and tell Kalypsō we have decreed that
poor enduring Odysseus is to return home [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]. He is to be
convoyed neither by gods nor men, but after a
perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is
to reach fertile Skheria, [35] the land of the
Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods, and
will honor him as though he were one of ourselves.
They will send him in a ship to his own country,
and will give him more bronze and gold and raiment
than he would have brought back from Troy, [40] if
he had had all his prize wealth and had got home
without disaster. This is how we have settled that
he shall return to his country and his
friends.”</p>
<p n="186" start-line="5.43" end-line="5.58">Thus he spoke, and Hermes, guide and guardian,
slayer of Argos, did as he was told. Right away he
bound on his glittering golden sandals [45] with
which he could fly like the wind over land and
sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s
eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases,
and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; [50]
then he swooped down through the firmament till he
reached the level of the sea, whose waves he
skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every
hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its
thick plumage in the spray. He flew and flew over
many a weary wave, [55] but when at last he got to
the island which was his journey’s end, he left
the sea and went on by land till he came to the
cave where the nymph Kalypsō lived.</p>
<p n="187" start-line="5.59" end-line="5.77">He found her at home. There was a large fire
burning on the hearth, and one could smell from
far the fragrant reek of burning cedar [60] and
sandalwood. As for herself, she was busy at her
loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp
and singing beautifully. Round her cave there was
a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling
cypress trees, [65] wherein all kinds of great
birds had built their nests—owls, hawks, and
chattering sea-crows that have their business in
the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained
and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave;
[70] there were also four running rills of water
in channels cut pretty close together, and turned
here and there so as to irrigate the beds of
violets and luscious herbage over which they
flowed. Even a god could not help being charmed
with such a lovely spot, [75] so Hermes stood
still and looked at it; but when he had admired it
sufficiently he went inside the cave.</p>
<p n="188" start-line="5.78" end-line="5.91">Kalypsō knew him at once— [80] for the gods all
know each other, no matter how far they live from
one another—but great-hearted Odysseus was not
within; he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking
out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes,
groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. [85]
Kalypsō, shining among goddesses, gave Hermes a
seat and said: “Why have you come to see me,
Hermes—honored, and ever welcome—for you do not
visit me often? Say what you want; I will do it
for you at once [90] if I can, and if it can be
done at all; but come inside, and let me set
refreshment before you.</p>
<p n="189" start-line="5.92" end-line="5.96">As she spoke she drew a table loaded with
ambrosia beside him and mixed him some red nectar,
so Hermes ate and drank [95] till he had had
enough, and then said:</p>
<p n="190" start-line="5.97" end-line="5.115">“We are speaking god and goddess to one
another, and you ask me why I have come here, and
I will tell you truly as you would have me do.
Zeus sent me; it was no doing of mine; [100] who
could possibly want to come all this way over the
sea where there are no cities full of people to
offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?
Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other
gods can cross aegis-bearing Zeus, nor transgress
his orders [his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>]. [105] He says that you have here
the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine
years before the city of King Priam and sailed
home in the tenth year after having ransacked it.
During their homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] they sinned against Athena, who
raised both wind and waves against them, [110] so
that all his brave companions perished, and he
alone was carried here by wind and tide. Zeus says
that you are to let this by man go at once, for it
is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from
his own people, but shall return [115] to his
house and country and see his friends again.”</p>
<p n="191" start-line="5.116" end-line="5.144">Kalypsō, shining among divinities, trembled
with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she
exclaimed, “ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You
are always jealous and hate seeing a goddess take
a fancy [120] to a mortal man, and live with him
in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made
love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you
furious till Artemis went and killed him in
Ortygia. [125] So again when Demeter of the lovely
hair fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him
in a thrice plowed fallow field, Zeus came to hear
of it before so long and killed Iasion with his
thunder-bolts. And now you are angry with me too
because [130] I have a man here. I found the poor
creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for
Zeus had struck his ship with lightning and sunk
it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were
drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and
waves on to my island. [135] I got fond of him and
cherished him, and had set my heart on making him
immortal, so that he should never grow old all his
days; still I cannot cross aegis-bearing Zeus, nor
bring his counsels [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] to nothing; therefore, if he
insists upon it, [140] let the man go beyond the
seas again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself
for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.
Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice,
in all good faith, as will be likely to bring him
safely to his own country.”</p>
<p n="192" start-line="5.145" end-line="5.147">[145] “Then send him away,” said Hermes, “and
fear the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mēnis</foreign> of Zeus, lest he grow angry and
punish you.”</p>
<p n="193" start-line="5.148" end-line="5.159">Then he took his leave, [150] and Kalypsō went
out to look for great-hearted Odysseus, for she
had heard Zeus’ message. She found him sitting
upon the beach with his eyes ever filled with
tears, his sweet life wasting away as he wept for
his homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>]; for he had got tired of
Kalypsō, and though he was forced to sleep with
her [155] in the cave by night, it was she, not
he, that would have it so. As for the daytime, he
spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore,
weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always
looking out upon the sea. Kalypsō then went close
up to him said:</p>
<p n="194" start-line="5.160" end-line="5.170">[160] “My poor man, you shall not stay here
grieving and fretting your life out any longer. I
am going to send you away of my own free will; so
go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a
large raft with an upper deck that it may carry
you safely over the sea. [165] I will put bread,
wine, and water on board to save you from
starving. I will also give you clothes, and will
send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods
in the sky so will it— [170] for they know more
about these things, and can settle them better
than I can.”</p>
<p n="195" start-line="5.171" end-line="5.179">Long-suffering great Odysseus shuddered as he
heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there is
something behind all this; <seg rend="subscript"
>173</seg> when you devise this you are devising
something else, and it’s not sending me on my way
home when you bid me do such a dreadful [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">deinon</foreign>] thing as put to
sea [175] on a raft. Not even a well-found ship
with a fair wind could venture on such a distant
voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make
me go on board a raft unless you first solemnly
swear that you mean me no mischief.”</p>
<p n="196" start-line="5.180" end-line="5.191">[180] Kalypsō, shining among divinities, smiled
at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know
a great deal,” said she, “but you are quite wrong
here. May the sky above and earth below be my
witnesses, [185] with the waters of the river
Styx—and this is the most solemn oath which a
blessed god can take—that I mean you no sort of
harm, <seg rend="subscript">188</seg> but I think
and ponder only the kinds of things <seg
rend="subscript">189</seg> that I would devise for
myself if I were in such need. [190] I have a
decent disposition [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] and my <seg rend="subscript"
>191</seg> heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thūmos</foreign>] is not of iron. It’s a
compassionate heart.”</p>
<p n="197" start-line="5.192" end-line="5.202">When she had thus spoken she led the way
rapidly before him, and Odysseus followed in her
steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and
on till they came to Kalypsō’s cave, [195] where
he took the seat that Hermes had just left. The
nymph set before him all kinds of food to eat and
drink of the kind that mortals consume; but she
herself sat opposite godlike Odysseus, and her
maids set ambrosia and nectar before her, [200]
and they laid their hands on the good things that
were before them. When they had satisfied
themselves with meat and drink, shining goddess
Kalypsō spoke, saying:</p>
<p n="198" start-line="5.203" end-line="5.213">“Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of Laertes, so
you would start home [205] to your own land at
once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only
know how much suffering is in store for you before
you get back to your own country, you would stay
where you are, keep house along with me, and let
me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you
may be to see [210] this wife of yours, of whom
you are thinking all the time, day after day; yet
I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or
well-looking than she is, for it is not to be
expected that a mortal woman should compare in
beauty with an immortal.”</p>
<p n="199" start-line="5.214" end-line="5.224">“Goddess,” replied resourceful Odysseus, [215]
“do not be angry with me about this. I am quite
aware that my wife, circumspect Penelope, is
nothing like so tall or so beautiful as yourself.
She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal.
Nevertheless, I want to get home, [220] and can
think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when
I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the best
of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land
and sea already, so let this go with the
rest.”</p>
<p n="200" start-line="5.225" end-line="5.227">[225] Presently the sun set and it became dark,
whereon the pair retired into the inner part of
the cave and went to bed.</p>
<p n="201" start-line="5.228" end-line="5.261">When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, Odysseus put on his khiton and cloak,
[230] while the goddess wore a dress of a light
gossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a
beautiful golden waistband about her waist and a
veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to
think how she could speed great-hearted Odysseus
on his way. So she gave him a great bronze axe
that suited his hands; [235] it was sharpened on
both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle
fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a sharp
adze, and then led the way to the far end of the
island where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar
and pine, that reached the sky— [240] very dry and
well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the
water. Then, when she had shown him where the best
trees grew, Kalypsō, shining among divinities,
went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon
finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all
and adzed them smooth, [245] squaring them by rule
in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Kalypsō,
the shining goddess, came back with some augers,
so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers
together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft
as broad as a skilled shipwright [250] makes the
beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on top
of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He
also made a mast with a yard arm, [255] and a
rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round
with wicker hurdles as a protection against the
waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By
and by Kalypsō, the shining goddess, brought him
some linen to make the sails, and he made these
too, excellently, [260] making them fast with
braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of
levers, he drew the raft down into the water.</p>
<p n="202" start-line="5.262" end-line="5.281">In four days he had completed the whole work,
and on the fifth shining Kalypsō sent him from the
island after washing him and giving him some clean
clothes. [265] She gave him a goat skin full of
black wine, and another larger one of water; she
also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and
found him much good meat. Moreover, she made the
wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did
glorious Odysseus spread his sail before it, [270]
while he sat and guided the raft skillfully by
means of the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but
kept them fixed on the Pleiades, on late-setting
Boötes, and on the Bear—which men also call the
wagon, and which turns round and round where it
is, facing Orion: [275] she alone has no share in
the baths of Okeanos —for Kalypsō, bright among
goddesses, had told him to keep this to his left.
Seventeen days did he sail over the sea, and on
the eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains
[280] on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast
appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.</p>
<p n="203" start-line="5.282" end-line="5.290">But lord Poseidon, the strong Earthshaker, who
was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of
Odysseus a long way off, from the mountains of the
Solymoi. He could see him sailing upon the sea,
and it made him very angry, [285] so he wagged his
head and muttered to himself, saying, “Heavens, so
the gods have been changing their minds about
Odysseus while I was away in Ethiopia, and now he
is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it
is decreed that he shall escape from the
calamities that have befallen him. [290] Still, he
shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has
done with it.”</p>
<p n="204" start-line="5.291" end-line="5.312">Then he gathered his clouds together, grasped
his trident, stirred it round in the sea, and
roused the rage of every wind that blows till
earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and
night sprang forth out of the sky. [295] Winds
from East, South, North, and West fell upon him
all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up,
so that Odysseus’ heart began to fail him. “Alas,”
he said to himself in his dismay, “what ever will
become of me? [300] I am afraid Kalypsō was right
when she said I should have trouble by sea before
I got back home. It is all coming true. How black
is Zeus making the sky with his clouds, and what a
sea the winds [305] are raising from every quarter
at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest and thrice
blest were those Danaans who fell at Troy in the
cause [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>]
of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been
killed on the day when the Trojans [310] were
pressing me so sorely about the dead body of
Achilles, for then I should have had due
burial <seg rend="subscript">311</seg> and then
the Achaeans would have carried on my [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]; but now it seems
that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”</p>
<p n="205" start-line="5.313" end-line="5.332">As he spoke a sea broke over him with such
terrific fury that the raft reeled again, [315]
and he was carried overboard a long way off. He
let go the helm, and the force of the hurricane
was so great that it broke the mast half way up,
and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For
a long time Odysseus was under water, and it was
all he could do [320] to rise to the surface
again, for the clothes Kalypsō had given him
weighed him down; but at last he got his head
above water and spat out the bitter brine that was
running down his face in streams. In spite of all
this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft,
[325] but swam as fast as he could towards it, got
hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to
escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed
it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round
and round upon a road. [330] [It was as though the
South, North, East, and West winds were all
playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at
once.]</p>
<p n="206" start-line="5.333" end-line="5.353"><seg rend="subscript">333</seg> He [= Odysseus]
was seen by the daughter of Kadmos. She is Ino,
with the beautiful ankles, <seg rend="subscript"
>334</seg> and she is also called the White
Goddess [Leukotheā], but she had been a mortal
before that, endowed with a special voice
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">audē</foreign>]. [335]
But now, in the depths, she had a share in the
honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>]
that belongs to gods. <seg rend="subscript"
>336</seg> She took pity on Odysseus, lost at sea
and suffering pains [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>algea</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>337</seg> Appearing as a winged diving bird
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aithuia</foreign>], she
emerged from the waters <seg rend="subscript"
>338</seg> and perched on the raft, addressing him
with this set of words [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mūthos</foreign>]: <seg rend="subscript"
>339</seg> “Unfortunate man, why on earth is
Poseidon the earth-shaker [340] so terribly
hateful toward you, creating so many bad
experiences for you? <seg rend="subscript"
>341</seg> But I now see that he will not destroy
you, much as he wants to. <seg rend="subscript"
>342</seg> Do as I tell you, and I think you will
not miss in your mind what I tell you: <seg
rend="subscript">343</seg> get out of these
clothes of yours and let your raft be carried off
by the winds. <seg rend="subscript">344</seg> Just
let it go. Then start paddling with your hands and
strive for your homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] [345] by heading
for the land of the Phaeacians, where your destiny
[moira] for escape awaits you. <seg
rend="subscript">346</seg> Here, take my veil
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krēdemnon</foreign>] and
wrap it around your chest. <seg rend="subscript"
>347</seg> It is a veil that is immortalizing
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ambroton</foreign>], and
there is nothing to be afraid of: you will not
suffer anything or be destroyed. <seg
rend="subscript">348</seg> But as soon as you
touch land with your hands, <seg rend="subscript"
>349</seg> at that moment take off the veil and
throw it into the wine-colored sea [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>]. [350] Throw it
as far back as you can into the sea, while you
turn in the other direction.” <seg
rend="subscript">351</seg> Speaking these words,
the goddess took off her veil [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">krēdemnon</foreign>] and gave it
him. <seg rend="subscript">352</seg> Then she
plunged down again into the seething sea [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], <seg
rend="subscript">353</seg> looking like the diving
bird [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aithuia</foreign>],
and vanished beneath the dark waves.</p>
<p n="207" start-line="5.354" end-line="5.364">But long-suffering great Odysseus did not know
what to think. [355] “Alas,” he said to himself in
his dismay, “this is only some one or other of the
gods who is luring me to ruin by advising me to
quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at
present, for the land where she said I should be
quit of all troubles seems to be still a good way
off. [360] I know what I will do—I am sure it will
be best—no matter what happens I will stick to the
raft as long as her timbers hold together, but
when the sea breaks her up I will swim for it; I
do not see how I can do any better than this.”</p>
<p n="208" start-line="5.365" end-line="5.381">[365] While he was thus in two minds, Poseidon,
shaker of the earth, sent a terrifying great wave
that seemed to rear itself above his head till it
broke right over the raft, which then went to
pieces [370] as though it were a heap of dry chaff
tossed about by a whirlwind. Odysseus got astride
of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on
horseback; he then took off the clothes divine
Kalypsō had given him, bound Ino’s veil under his
arms, and plunged into the sea— [375] meaning to
swim on shore. King Poseidon, the strong
Earthshaker, watched him as he did so, and wagged
his head, muttering to himself and saying, “‘There
now, swim up and down as you best can till you
fall in with well-to-do people. I do not think you
will be able to say that I have let you off too
lightly.” [380] Then he lashed his fair-maned
horses and drove to Aigai where his palace is.</p>
<p n="209" start-line="5.382" end-line="5.387">But Athena, daughter of Zeus, resolved to help
Odysseus, so she bound the ways of all the winds
except one, and made them lie quite still; [385]
but she roused a good stiff breeze from the North
that should lay the waters till Zeus-sprung
Odysseus reached the land of the oar-loving
Phaeacians where he would be safe.</p>
<p n="210" start-line="5.388" end-line="5.405">Then he floated about for two nights and two
days in the water, with a heavy swell on the sea
and death staring him in the face; [390] but when
the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a
dead calm without so much as a breath of air
stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked
eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near.
Then, as children rejoice when their dear father
[395] begins to get better after having for a long
time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry
spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was
Odysseus thankful when he again saw land and
trees, and swam on with all his strength that he
might once more set foot upon dry ground. [400]
When, however, he got within earshot, he began to
hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for
the swell still broke against them with a terrific
roar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there
were no harbors where a ship might ride, nor
shelter of any kind, [405] but only headlands,
low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.</p>
<p n="211" start-line="5.406" end-line="5.423">Odysseus’ heart now began to fail him, and he
said despairingly to himself, “Alas, Zeus has let
me see land after swimming so far that I had given
up all hope, [410] but I can find no landing
place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten, the
rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with
deep water close under them so that I cannot climb
out for want of foothold. [415] I am afraid some
great wave will lift me off my legs and dash me
against the rocks as I leave the water—which would
give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I
swim further in search of some shelving beach or
harbor, a hurricane may [420] carry me out to sea
again sorely against my will, or the gods may send
some great monster of the deep to attack me; for
Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that
Poseidon, the renowned Earthshaker, is very angry
with me.”</p>
<p n="212" start-line="5.424" end-line="5.435">While he was thus in two minds [425] a wave
caught him and took him with such force against
the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn
to pieces if the owl-vision goddess Athena had not
shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock
with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain
till the wave retired, so he was saved [430] that
time; but presently the wave came on again and
carried him back with it far into the sea—tearing
his hands as the suckers of an octopus are torn
when some one plucks it from its bed, and the
stones come up along with it—even so did the rocks
[435] tear the skin from his strong hands, and
then the wave drew him deep down under the
water.</p>
<p n="213" start-line="5.436" end-line="5.450">Here poor Odysseus would have certainly
perished even in spite of his own destiny, if the
owl-vision goddess Athena had not helped him to
keep his wits about him. He swam seaward again,
beyond reach of the surf that was beating against
the land, and at the same time he kept looking
towards the shore to see if he could find [440]
some haven, or a spit that should take the waves
aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the
mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the
best place, for there were no rocks, and it
afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there
was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:
[445] “Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and
save me from the anger of the sea-god Poseidon,
for I approach you prayerfully. Anyone who has
lost his way has at all times a claim even upon
the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw near to
your stream, and cling to the knees of your
riverhood. [450] Have mercy upon me, O King, for I
declare myself your suppliant.”</p>
<p n="214" start-line="5.451" end-line="5.463">Then the god stayed his stream and stilled the
waves, making all calm before him, and bringing
him safely into the mouth of the river. Here at
last Odysseus’ knees and strong hands failed him,
for the sea had completely broken him. [455] His
body was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils
ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he
could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning
from sheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got
his breath and came to himself again, he took off
the scarf that Ino had given him [460] and threw
it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon
Ino received it into her hands from the wave that
bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid
himself down among the rushes, and kissed the
bounteous earth.</p>
<p n="215" start-line="5.464" end-line="5.473">“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay,
[465] “what ever will become of me, and how is it
all to end? If I stay here upon the river-bed
through the long watches of the night, I am so
exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make
an end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a
keen wind blowing from off the river. [470] If, on
the other hand, I climb the hill side, find
shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I
may escape the cold and have a good night’s rest,
but some savage beast may take advantage of me and
devour me.”</p>
<p n="216" start-line="5.474" end-line="5.493">In the end [475] he thought it best to take to
the woods, and he found one upon some high ground
not far from the water. There he crept beneath two
shoots of olive that grew from a single stock—the
one ungrafted, while the other had been grafted.
No wind, however squally, could break through the
cover they afforded, nor could the sun’s rays
pierce them, [480] nor the rain get through them,
so closely did they grow into one another.
Odysseus crept under these and began to make
himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great
litter of dead leaves lying about—enough to make a
covering for two [485] or three men even in hard
winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so
he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all
round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the
country, far from any neighbor, [490] hides a
brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself
from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did
Odysseus cover himself up with leaves; and Athena
shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his
eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his
sorrows.</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 6</head>
<p n="217" start-line="6.1" end-line="6.40" rend="no-indent">So here long-suffering great
Odysseus slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but
Athena went off to the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> and city of the Phaeacians—a
people who used to live in the fair town of
Hypereia, [5] near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the
Cyclopes were stronger in force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] than they and
plundered them, so their king, godlike Nausithoös,
moved them thence and settled them in Skheria, far
from all other people. He surrounded the city with
a wall, built houses [10] and temples, and divided
the lands among his people; but he was dead and
gone to the house of Hādēs, and King Alkinoos,
whose counsels were inspired by the gods, was now
reigning. To his house, then, did owl-vision
goddess Athena go in furtherance of the return
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of
great-hearted Odysseus. [15] She came into the
private chamber, with its many adornments, where
the girl [= Nausicaa] <seg rend="subscript"
>16</seg> was sleeping. Like the immortal
goddesses, in shape and in looks [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">eidos</foreign>], she [= Nausicaa]
was looking like [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>homoiē</foreign>] them. Nausicaa, daughter to
great-hearted King Alkinoos. Two maid servants
were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on
either side of the doorway, which was closed with
well-made folding doors. [20] Athena took the form
of the famous sea captain Dymas’ daughter, who was
a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;
then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a
breath of wind, she hovered over her head and
said: [25] “Nausicaa, what can your mother have
been about, to have such a lazy daughter? Here are
your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are
going to be married almost immediately, and should
not only be well dressed yourself, but should find
good clothes for those who attend you. This is the
way to get yourself a good name, [30] and to make
your father and mother proud of you. Suppose,
then, that we make tomorrow a washing day, and
start at daybreak. I will come and help you so
that you may have everything ready as soon as
possible, for all the best young men [35]
throughout your own <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> are courting you, and you are not
going to remain a young girl much longer. Ask your
father, therefore, to have a wagon and mules ready
for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and
belts; and you can ride, too, which will be much
pleasanter for you [40] than walking, for the
washing-cisterns are some way from the town.”</p>
<p n="218" start-line="6.41" end-line="6.56">When she had said this owl-vision Athena went
away to Olympus, which they say is the everlasting
home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and
neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides [45]
in everlasting sunshine and in a great
peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods
are illumined for ever and ever. This was the
place to which the owl-vision goddess went when
she had given instructions to the girl. By and by
morning came, throned in splendor, and woke
Nausicaa, who began wondering about her dream;
[50] she therefore went to the other end of the
house to tell her father and mother all about it,
and found them in their own room. Her mother was
sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn
with her maids around her, and she happened to
catch her father just as he was going out to
attend a meeting of the town council, [55] which
the proud Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She
stopped him and said:</p>
<p n="219" start-line="6.57" end-line="6.65">“Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a
good big wagon? I want to take all our dirty
clothes to the river and wash them. [60] You are
the chief man here, so it is only right that you
should have a clean khiton when you attend
meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five
sons at home, two of them married, while the other
three are good-looking bachelors; you know they
always like to have clean linen [65] when they go
to a dance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>khoros</foreign>], and I have been thinking about
all this.”</p>
<p n="220" start-line="6.66" end-line="6.70">She did not say a word about her own wedding,
for she did not like to, but her father knew and
said, “You shall have the mules, my love, and
whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with
you, and the men shall get you [70] a good strong
wagon with a body to it that will hold all your
clothes.”</p>
<p n="221" start-line="6.71" end-line="6.84">Then he gave his orders to the servants, who
got the wagon out, harnessed the mules, and put
them to, while the girl brought the clothes down
from the linen room [75] and placed them on the
wagon. Her mother prepared her a basket of
provisions with all sorts of good things, and a
goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the
wagon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse
of oil, [80] that she and her women might anoint
themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and
lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and
their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled
without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa
and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who
were with her.</p>
<p n="222" start-line="6.85" end-line="6.109">[85] When they reached the water side they went
to the washing-cisterns, through which there ran
at all times enough pure water to wash any
quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they
unharnessed the mules and turned them out [90] to
feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the
water side. They took the clothes out of the
wagon, put them in the water, and vied with one
another in treading them in the pits to get the
dirt out. After they had washed them and got them
quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side,
where [95] the waves had raised a high beach of
shingle, and set about washing themselves and
anointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got
their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited
for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When
they had done dinner [100] they threw off the
veils that covered their heads and began to play
at ball, while Nausicaa of the white arms sang for
them. As the huntress Artemis, who showers arrows,
goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetos or
Erymanthos to hunt wild boars or deer, [105] and
the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Zeus,
take their sport along with her (then is Leto
proud at seeing her daughter stand a full head
taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest
amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the
girl outshine her handmaids.</p>
<p n="223" start-line="6.110" end-line="6.118">[110] When it was time for them to start home,
and they were folding the clothes and putting them
into the wagon, owl-vision goddess Athena began to
consider how Odysseus should wake up and see the
handsome girl who was to conduct him to the city
of the Phaeacians. [115] The girl, therefore,
threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed her
and fell into deep water. Then they all shouted,
and the noise they made woke noble Odysseus, who
sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder
what it might all be.</p>
<p n="224" start-line="6.119" end-line="6.126">“Alas,” said he to himself, “what kind of
people have I come amongst? [120] Are they cruel,
savage, and uncivilized [= not <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>], or hospitable
and endowed with a god-fearing mind [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]? I seem to hear
the voices of young women, and they sound like
those of the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or
springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. At
any rate I am [125] among a lineage of men and
women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look
at them.”</p>
<p n="225" start-line="6.127" end-line="6.148">As he said this he crept from under his bush,
and broke off a bough covered with thick leaves to
hide his nakedness. [130] He looked like some lion
of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in
his strength and defying both wind and rain; his
eyes glare as he prowls in quest of oxen, sheep,
or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break
even into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get
at the sheep— [135] even such did Odysseus seem to
the young women, as he drew near to them all naked
as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one
so unkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the
others scampered off along the spits that jutted
out into the sea, but the daughter of Alkinoos
stood firm, for Athena [140] put courage into her
heart and took away all fear from her. She stood
right in front of Odysseus, and he doubted whether
he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet,
and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay
where he was and entreat her to give him some
clothes and show him the way to the town. [145] In
the end he thought it best to entreat her from a
distance in case the girl should take offence at
his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he
addressed her in honeyed and persuasive
language.</p>
<p n="226" start-line="6.149" end-line="6.174">“O queen,” he said, “I implore your aid—but
tell me, are you a goddess or are you a mortal
woman? [150] If you are a goddess and dwell in the
sky, I can only conjecture that you are Zeus’
daughter Artemis, for your face and figure
resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you
are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are
your father and mother— [155] thrice happy, too,
are your brothers and sisters; how proud and
delighted they must feel when they see so fair a
scion as yourself going out to a dance [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>]; most happy,
however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts
have been the richest, and who takes you to his
own [160] home. I never yet saw any one so
beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in
admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you
to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at
Delos growing near the altar of Apollo—for I was
there, too, with much people after me, [165] when
I was on that journey which has been the source of
all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant
shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired
and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and
wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees,
but I am in great distress [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]; [170]
yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been
tossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves
have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island,
and now a superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] has flung me
upon this coast that I may endure still further
suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come
to the end of it, but rather that the gods have
still much evil in store for me.</p>
<p n="227" start-line="6.175" end-line="6.185">[175] And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for
you are the first person I have met, and I know no
one else in this country. Show me the way to your
town, and let me have anything that you may have
brought here to wrap your clothes in. [180] May
the gods grant you in all things your heart’s
desire—husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home;
for there is nothing better in this world than
that man and wife should be of one mind in a
house. It discomfits their enemies, [185] makes
the hearts of their friends glad, and they
themselves know more about it than any one.”</p>
<p n="228" start-line="6.186" end-line="6.197">To this Nausicaa of the white arms answered,
“Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,
well-disposed person. There is no accounting for
luck; Zeus, the Olympian, gives prosperity
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>] to rich
and poor just as he chooses, [190] so you must
take what he has seen fit to send you, and make
the best of it. Now, however, that you have come
to this our country, you shall not want for
clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in
distress may reasonably look for. I will show you
the way to the town, and will tell you the name of
our people: [195] we are called Phaeacians, and I
am daughter to great-hearted Alkinoos, in whom the
whole strength and power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>] of the state is vested.”</p>
<p n="229" start-line="6.198" end-line="6.210">Then she called her maids and said, “Stay where
you are, you girls. Can you not see a man without
running away from him? [200] Do you take him for a
robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else
can come here to do us Phaeacians any harm, for we
are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land’s
end [205] that juts into the sounding sea, and
have nothing to do with any other people. This is
only some poor man who has lost his way, and we
must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners
in distress are under Zeus’ protection, and will
take what they can get and be thankful; so, girls,
give the poor man something to eat and drink,
[210] and wash him in the stream at some place
that is sheltered from the wind.”</p>
<p n="230" start-line="6.211" end-line="6.222">Then the maids left off running away and began
calling one another back. They made Odysseus sit
down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and
brought him a khiton and cloak. [215] They also
brought him the little golden cruse of oil, and
told him to go wash in the stream. But glorious
Odysseus said, “Young women, please to stand a
little on one side that I may wash the brine from
my shoulders and anoint myself with oil, [220] for
it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of
oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep
standing there. I am ashamed to strip before a
number of good-looking young women.”</p>
<p n="231" start-line="6.223" end-line="6.238">Then they stood on one side and went to tell
the girl, while great Odysseus washed himself in
the stream and scrubbed [225] the brine from his
back and from his broad shoulders. When he had
thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine
out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and
put on the clothes which the girl had given him;
Athena, daughter of Zeus, then made him look
taller and stronger [230] than before, she also
made the hair grow thick on the top of his head,
and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she
poured down gracefulness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kharis</foreign>] over his head and shoulders as
a skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds
under Hephaistos and Athena enriches a piece of
silver plate by gilding it— [235] and his work is
full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little
way off upon the beach, looking quite young and
full of charm [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kharis</foreign>], and the girl gazed on him with
admiration; then she said to her maids:</p>
<p n="232" start-line="6.239" end-line="6.246">“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something.
[240] I believe the gods who live in the sky have
sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw
him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is
like that of the gods who dwell in the sky. I
should like my future husband to be just such
another as he is, [245] if he would only stay here
and not want to go away. However, give him
something to eat and drink.”</p>
<p n="233" start-line="6.247" end-line="6.254">They did as they were told, and set food before
noble and long-suffering Odysseus, who ate and
drank ravenously, [250] for it was long since he
had had food of any kind. Meanwhile, Nausicaa of
the white arms turned her thoughts to another
matter. She got the linen folded and placed in the
wagon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took
her seat, she called Odysseus:</p>
<p n="234" start-line="6.255" end-line="6.272">[255] “Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be
going back to the town; I will introduce you at
the house of my excellent father, where I can tell
you that you will meet all the best people among
the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I bid you,
for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as
we are going past the fields and farm lands, [260]
follow briskly behind the wagon along with the
maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently,
however, we shall come to the town, where you will
find a high wall running all round it, and a good
harbor on either side with a narrow entrance into
the city, [265] and the ships will be drawn up by
the roadside, for every one has a place where his
own ship can lie. You will see the market place
with a temple of Poseidon in the middle of it, and
paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here
people deal in ship’s gear of all kinds, such as
cables and sails, and here, too, are the places
where oars are made, [270] for the Phaeacians are
not a nation of archers; they know nothing about
bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and
pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships,
with which they travel far over the sea.</p>
<p n="235" start-line="6.273" end-line="6.288">I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may
be set on foot against me later on; for the people
in the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> here are very ill-natured, [275]
and some lowly man, if he met us, might say, ‘Who
is this fine-looking stranger that is going about
with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose
she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a
vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some
foreign vessel, for we have no neighbors; [280] or
some god has at last come down from the sky in
answer to her prayers, and she is going to live
with him all the rest of her life. It would be a
better thing if she would take herself away and
find a husband somewhere else, for she will not
look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians
in the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> who woo her.’ [285] This is the
kind of disparaging remark that would be made
about me, and I could not complain, for I should
myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do
the like, and go about with men in spite of
everybody, while her father and mother were still
alive, and without having been married in the face
of all the world.</p>
<p n="236" start-line="6.289" end-line="6.315">If, therefore, [290] you want my father to give
you an escort and to help you to your homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], do as
I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of
poplars by the roadside dedicated to Athena; it
has a well in it and a meadow all round it. Here
my father has a field of rich garden ground, about
as far from the town as a man’s voice will carry.
[295] Sit down there and wait for a while till the
rest of us can get into the town and reach my
father’s house. Then, when you think we must have
done this, come into the town and ask the way to
the house of my father, great-hearted Alkinoos.
[300] You will have no difficulty in finding it;
any child will point it out to you, for no one
else in the whole town has anything like such a
fine house as he has. When you have got past the
gates and through the outer court, go right across
the inner court till you come to [305] my mother.
You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning
her purple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight
to see her as she leans back against one of the
bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind
her. Close to her seat stands that of my father,
on which he sits and drinks wine like an immortal
god. [310] Never mind him, but go up to my mother,
and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get
home quickly. If you can win her over, you may
hope to see your own country again, [315] no
matter how distant it may be.”</p>
<p n="237" start-line="6.316" end-line="6.323">So saying she lashed the mules with her whip
and they left the river. The mules drew well and
their hoofs went up and down upon the road. She
was careful not to go too fast for Odysseus [320]
and the maids who were following on foot along
with the wagon, so she plied her whip with
judgment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>]. As the sun was going down they
came to the sacred grove of Athena, and there
great Odysseus sat down and prayed to the mighty
daughter of Zeus.</p>
<p n="238" start-line="6.324" end-line="6.327">“Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of Aegis-bearing
Zeus, the one who cannot be worn down, [325] hear
me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when
Poseidon was wrecking me. Now, therefore, have
pity upon me and grant that I may find friends and
be hospitably received by the Phaeacians.”</p>
<p n="239" start-line="6.328" end-line="6.331">Thus did he pray, and Athena heard his prayer,
but she would not show herself to him openly, for
she was afraid of her [330] uncle, Poseidon, who
was still furious in his endeavors to prevent
godlike Odysseus from getting home.</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 7</head>
<p n="240" start-line="7.1" end-line="7.13" rend="no-indent">Thus, then, did long-suffering
great Odysseus wait and pray; but the girl drove
on to the town. When she reached her father’s
house she drew up at the gateway, and her brothers
[5] —comely as the gods—gathered round her, took
the mules out of the wagon, and carried the
clothes into the house, while she went to her own
room, where an old servant, Eurymedousa of Apeira,
lit the fire for her. This old woman had been
brought by sea [10] from Apeira, and had been
chosen as a prize for Alkinoos because he was king
over the Phaeacians, and the people in
the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> obeyed him as though he were a
god. She had been nurse to white-armed Nausicaa,
and had now lit the fire for her, and brought her
supper for her into her own room.</p>
<p n="241" start-line="7.14" end-line="7.21">Presently Odysseus got up to go towards the
town; and Athena [15] shed a thick mist all round
him to hide him in case any of the proud
Phaeacians who met him should be rude to him, or
ask him who he was. Then, as he was just entering
the town, she came towards him in the likeness
[20] of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She
stood right in front of him, and great Odysseus
said:</p>
<p n="242" start-line="7.22" end-line="7.26">“My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the
house of King Alkinoos? I am an unfortunate
foreigner in distress, [25] and do not know one in
your town and country.”</p>
<p n="243" start-line="7.27" end-line="7.36">Then owl-vision goddess Athena said, “Yes,
father stranger, I will show you the house you
want, for Alkinoos lives quite close to my own
father. [30] I will go before you and show the
way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look
at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people
here cannot abide strangers, and do not like men
who come from some other place. They are a
sea-faring folk, and sail [35] the seas by the
grace of Poseidon in ships that glide along like
thought, or as a bird in the air.”</p>
<p n="244" start-line="7.37" end-line="7.47">Then she led the way, and Odysseus followed in
her steps; but not one of the Phaeacians could see
him [40] as he passed through the city in the
midst of them; for the great goddess Athena in her
good will towards him had hidden him in a thick
cloud of darkness. He admired their harbors,
ships, places of assembly, and the lofty [45]
walls of the city, which, with the palisade on top
of them, were very striking, and when they reached
the king’s house Athena, the owl-vision goddess,
said:</p>
<p n="245" start-line="7.48" end-line="7.60">“This is the house, father stranger, which you
would have me show you. You will find a number of
great people [50] sitting at table, but do not be
afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is
the more likely he is to carry his point, even
though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her
name is Arete, and she comes of the same [55]
family as her husband Alkinoos. They both descend
originally from Poseidon, shaker of the Earth, who
was father to Nausithoös by Periboia, a woman of
great beauty. Periboia was the youngest daughter
of great-hearted Eurymedon, who at one time
reigned over the giants, [60] but he ruined his
ill-fated people and lost his own life to
boot.</p>
<p n="246" start-line="7.61" end-line="7.77">Poseidon, however, lay with his daughter, and
she had a son by him, the great-hearted
Nausithoös, who reigned over the Phaeacians.
Nausithoös had two sons Rhexenor and Alkinoos;
Apollo of the silver bow killed the first of them
[65] while he was still a bridegroom and without
male issue; but he left a daughter Arete, whom
Alkinoos married, and honors as no other woman is
honored of all those that keep house along with
their husbands. Thus she both was, and still is,
respected beyond measure [70] by her children, by
Alkinoos himself, and by the whole people, who
look upon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever
she goes about the city, for she is a thoroughly
good woman both in mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] and heart, and when any women are
friends of hers, she will help their husbands also
to settle their disputes. [75] If you can gain her
good will, you may have every hope of seeing your
friends again, and getting safely back to your
home and country.”</p>
<p n="247" start-line="7.78" end-line="7.90"><seg rend="subscript">78</seg> Speaking thus,
Athena [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>Athēnē</foreign>], with the looks of an owl, went
off <seg rend="subscript">79</seg> over the barren
sea, leaving behind lovely Skheria. [80] She came
to Marathon and to Athens [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">Athēnē</foreign>], with its wide
causeways, <seg rend="subscript">81</seg> and she
entered the well-built house of Erekhtheus. But
Odysseus <seg rend="subscript">82</seg> went
toward the renowned house of Alkinoos, and he
pondered much as he paused a while before reaching
the threshold of bronze. <seg rend="subscript"
>84</seg> There was a gleam [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aiglē</foreign>] there, which was
like the gleam of the sun or the moon, [85]
spreading throughout that palace famed for its
high ceilings, that home of great-hearted
Alkinoos. <seg rend="subscript">86</seg> There
were walls made of bronze [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">khalkeoi</foreign>], along either
side <seg rend="subscript">87</seg> stretching all
the way from the threshold to the inner chamber,
and all around the walls was a frieze of
blue. <seg rend="subscript">88</seg> Doors made of
gold closed off the sturdy building on the
inside, <seg rend="subscript">89</seg> and posts
made of silver were set in place into the
threshold made of bronze [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>khalkeos oudos</foreign>]. [90] Silver was the
lintel, and golden was the handle of the door.</p>
<p n="248" start-line="7.91" end-line="7.111">On either side there stood gold and silver
mastiffs which Hephaistos, with his consummate
skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over
the palace of great-hearted king Alkinoos; so they
were immortal and could never grow old. [95] Seats
were ranged all along the wall, here and there
from one end to the other, with coverings of fine
woven work which the women of the house had made.
Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to
sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at
all seasons; [100] and there were golden figures
of young men with lighted torches in their hands,
raised on pedestals, to give light by night to
those who were at table. There are fifty maid
servants in the house, some of whom are always
grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, [105]
while others work at the loom, or sit and spin,
and their shuttles go, backwards and forwards like
the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is
so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the
Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so
their women [110] excel all others in weaving, for
Athena has taught them all manner of useful arts,
and they are very intelligent.</p>
<p n="249" start-line="7.112" end-line="7.132">Outside the gate of the outer court there is a
large garden of about four acres with a wall all
round it. It is full of beautiful trees— [115]
pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious
apples. There are luscious figs also, and olives
in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail all
the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the
air is so soft that a new crop ripens before the
old has dropped. [120] Pear grows on pear, apple
on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the
grapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the
level ground of a part of this, the grapes are
being made into raisins; in another part they are
being gathered; [125] some are being trodden in
the wine tubs, others further on have shed their
blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others
again are just changing color. In the furthest
part of the ground there are beautifully arranged
beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year
round. Two streams go through it, the one turned
in ducts throughout the whole [130] garden, while
the other is carried under the ground of the outer
court to the house itself, and the town’s people
draw water from it. Such, then, were the splendors
with which the gods had endowed the house of King
Alkinoos.</p>
<p n="250" start-line="7.133" end-line="7.145">So here long-suffering great Odysseus stood for
a while and looked about him, but when he had
looked long enough [135] he crossed the threshold
and went within the precincts of the house. There
he found all the chief people among the Phaeacians
making their drink-offerings to sharp-eyed Hermes,
which they always did the last thing before going
away for the night. He went straight through the
court, [140] still hidden by the cloak of darkness
in which Athena had enveloped him, till he reached
Arete and King Alkinoos; then he laid his hands
upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment
the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he
became visible. Every one was speechless with
surprise at seeing a man there, [145] but Odysseus
began at once with his petition.</p>
<p n="251" start-line="7.146" end-line="7.152">“Queen Arete,” he exclaimed, “daughter of
godlike Rhexenor, in my distress I humbly pray
you, as also your husband and these your guests
(whom may the gods make prosperous with long life
and happiness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbos</foreign>], and may they leave their
possessions to their children, [150] and all the
honors conferred upon them by the state [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]) to help me home
to my own country as soon as possible; for I have
been long in trouble and away from my
friends.”</p>
<p n="252" start-line="7.153" end-line="7.158">Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes
and they all held their peace, [155] till
presently the old hero Ekheneus, who was an
excellent speaker and an elder among the
Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty addressed
them thus:</p>
<p n="253" start-line="7.159" end-line="7.166">“Alkinoos,” said he, “it is not creditable to
you [160] that a stranger should be seen sitting
among the ashes of your hearth; everyone is
waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell
him, then, to rise and take a seat on a stool
inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some
wine and water that we may make a drink-offering
to Zeus, the lord of thunder, [165] who takes all
well-disposed suppliants under his protection; and
let the housekeeper give him some supper, of
whatever there may be in the house.”</p>
<p n="254" start-line="7.167" end-line="7.181">When Alkinoos heard this he took the
high-spirited and much-devising Odysseus by the
hand, raised him from the hearth, [170] and bade
him take the seat of powerful Laodamas, who had
been sitting beside him and was his favorite son.
A maid servant then brought him water in a
beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver
basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a
clean table beside him; [175] an upper servant
brought him bread and offered him many good things
of what there was in the house, and long-suffering
great Odysseus ate and drank. Then Alkinoos, the
hallowed prince, said to the herald [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kērux</foreign>], “Pontonoos, mix
a cup of wine and hand it round [180] that we may
make drink-offerings to Zeus the lord of thunder,
who is the protector of all well-disposed
suppliants.”</p>
<p n="255" start-line="7.182" end-line="7.185">Pontonoos then mixed wine and water, and handed
it round after giving every man his
drink-offering. When they had made their
offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was
minded, [185] Alkinoos said:</p>
<p n="256" start-line="7.186" end-line="7.206">“Aldermen and town councilors of the
Phaeacians, hear my words. You have had your
supper, so now go home to bed. Tomorrow morning I
shall invite a still larger number of aldermen,
[190] and will give a sacrificial banquet in honor
of our guest; we can then discuss the question of
his escort, and consider how we may at once send
him back rejoicing to his own country without toil
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] or
inconvenience to himself, no matter how distant it
may be. [195] We must see that he comes to no harm
while on his homeward journey, but when he is once
at home he will have to take the luck he was born
with for better or worse like other people. It is
possible, however, that the stranger is one of the
immortals who has come down from the sky to visit
us; [200] but in this case the gods are departing
from their usual practice, for hitherto they have
made themselves perfectly clear to us when we have
been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at
our feasts just like one of our selves, and if any
solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one
or other of them, [205] they affect no
concealment, for we are as near of kin to the gods
as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.”</p>
<p n="257" start-line="7.207" end-line="7.225">Then resourceful Odysseus said: “Pray,
Alkinoos, do not take any such notion into your
head. I have nothing of the immortal about me,
[210] neither in body nor mind, and most resemble
those among you who are the most afflicted.
Indeed, were I to tell you all that the gods have
seen fit to lay upon me, you would say that I was
still worse off than they are. [215] Nevertheless,
let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty
stomach is a very importunate thing, and thrusts
itself on a man’s notice no matter how dire is his
distress [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>penthos</foreign>]. I am in great distress
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>],
[220] yet it insists that I shall eat and drink,
bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and
dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As
for yourselves, do as you propose, and at break of
day set about helping me to get home. I shall be
content to die if I may first once more [225]
behold my property, my bondsmen, and all the
greatness of my house.”</p>
<p n="258" start-line="7.226" end-line="7.239">Thus did he speak. Every one approved his
saying, and agreed that he should have his escort
inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when
they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk
each as much as he was minded they went home to
bed every man in his own abode, [230] leaving
great Odysseus in the hall with Arete and godlike
Alkinoos while the servants were taking the things
away after supper. White-armed Arete was the first
to speak, for she recognized the khiton, cloak,
[235] and good clothes that Odysseus was wearing,
as the work of herself and of her maids; so she
said, “Stranger, before we go any further, there
is a question I should like to ask you. Who, and
whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?
Did you not say you had come here from beyond the
sea?”</p>
<p n="259" start-line="7.240" end-line="7.258">[240] And resourceful Odysseus answered, “It
would be a long story, my Lady, were I to relate
in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand
of the gods has been laid heavy upon me; but as
regards your question, there is an island far away
in the sea which is called ‘the Ogygian’. [245]
Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess
Kalypsō, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself
far from all neighbors human or divine. A
superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>], however, led me to her hearth
all desolate and alone, for Zeus struck my ship
with his thunderbolts, [250] and broke it up in
mid-ocean. My brave comrades were drowned every
man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was
carried here and there for the space of nine days,
till at last during the darkness of the tenth
night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island
where the great goddess Kalypsō of ordered hair
[255] lives. She took me in and treated me with
the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me
immortal that I might never grow old, but she
could not persuade me to let her do so.</p>
<p n="260" start-line="7.259" end-line="7.277">I stayed with Kalypsō seven years straight on
end, and watered [260] the good clothes she gave
me with my tears during the whole time; but at
last when the eighth year came round she bade me
depart of her own free will, either because Zeus
had told her she must, or because she had changed
her mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>]. She sent me from her island on a
raft, which she provisioned [265] with abundance
of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout
clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm
and fair. Seventeen days did I sail over the sea,
and on the eighteenth I caught sight of the first
outlines of the mountains upon your coast—and glad
indeed was I to set eyes upon them. [270]
Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store
for me, for at this point the Earthshaker Poseidon
would let me go no further, and raised a great
storm against me; the sea was so terribly high
that I could no longer keep to my raft, [275]
which went to pieces under the fury of the gale,
and I had to swim for it, till wind and current
brought me to your shores.</p>
<p n="261" start-line="7.278" end-line="7.297">There I tried to land, but could not, for it
was a bad place and the waves dashed me against
the rocks, [280] so I again took to the sea and
swam on till I came to a river that seemed the
most likely landing place, for there were no rocks
and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I
got out of the water and gathered my senses
together again. Night was coming on, so I left the
river, [285] and went into a thicket, where I
covered myself all over with leaves, and presently
the gods sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick
and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all
night, and through the next day till afternoon,
when I woke as the sun was setting in the west,
[290] and saw your daughter’s maid servants
playing upon the beach, and your daughter among
them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid,
and she proved to be of an excellent disposition,
much more so than could be expected from so young
a person—for young people are apt to be
thoughtless. [295] She gave me plenty of bread and
wine, and when she had had me washed in the river
she also gave me the clothes in which you see me.
Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so,
I have told you the whole truth [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alētheia</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="262" start-line="7.298" end-line="7.301">Then Alkinoos said, “Stranger, [300] it was
very wrong of my daughter not to bring you on at
once to my house along with the maids, seeing that
she was the first person whose aid you asked.”</p>
<p n="263" start-line="7.302" end-line="7.307">“Pray do not scold her,” replied resourceful
Odysseus; “she is not to blame. She did tell me to
follow along with the maids, [305] but I was
ashamed and afraid, for I thought you might
perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human
being is sometimes a little suspicious and
irritable.”</p>
<p n="264" start-line="7.308" end-line="7.328">“Stranger,” replied Alkinoos, “I am not the
kind of man [310] to get angry about nothing; it
is always better to be reasonable; but by Father
Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, now that I see what kind
of person you are, and how much you think as I do,
I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and
become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give
you a house and an estate, [315] but no one (may
the gods forbid) shall keep you here against your
own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will
attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You
can sleep during the whole voyage if you like, and
the men shall sail you over smooth waters [320]
either to your own home, or wherever you please,
even though it be a long way further off than
Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when
they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityos
the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any
place— [325] and yet they did the whole voyage in
a single day without distressing themselves, and
came back again afterwards. You will thus see how
much my ships excel all others, and what
magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”</p>
<p n="265" start-line="7.329" end-line="7.333">Then was long-suffering great Odysseus glad
[330] and prayed aloud saying, “Father Zeus, grant
that Alkinoos may do all as he has said, for so he
will win an imperishable <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign> among humankind, and at the same
time I shall return to my country.”</p>
<p n="266" start-line="7.334" end-line="7.343">Thus did they converse. [335] Then Arete of the
white arms told her maids to set a bed in the room
that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good
red rugs, and to spread coverlets on the top of
them with woolen cloaks for Odysseus to wear. The
maids then went out with torches in their hands,
[340] and when they had made the bed they came up
to Odysseus and said, “Rise, sir stranger, and
come with us for your bed is ready,” and glad
indeed was he to go to his rest.</p>
<p n="267" start-line="7.344" end-line="7.347">So long-suffering great Odysseus slept in a bed
[345] placed in a room over the echoing gateway;
but Alkinoos lay in the inner part of the house,
with the queen his wife by his side.</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 8</head>
<p n="268" start-line="8.1" end-line="8.14" rend="no-indent">Now when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alkinoos, the
hallowed prince, and Odysseus, ransacker of
cities, both rose, and Alkinoos led the way [5] to
the Phaeacian place of assembly, which was near
the ships. When they got there they sat down
side-by-side on a seat of polished stone, while
Athena took the form of one of the servants of the
high-spirited Alkinoos, and went round the town in
order to contrive <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos </foreign>for great-hearted Odysseus. [10]
She went up to the townspeople, man by man, and
said, “Aldermen and town councilors of the
Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and
listen to the stranger who has just come off a
long voyage to the house of high-spirited King
Alkinoos; he looks like an immortal god.”</p>
<p n="269" start-line="8.15" end-line="8.24">[15] With these words she made them all want to
come, and they flocked to the assembly till seats
and standing room were alike crowded. Every one
was struck with the appearance of Odysseus,
high-spirited son of Laertes, for Athena had given
him gracefulness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kharis</foreign>] about the head and shoulders,
[20] making him look taller and stouter than he
really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians
favorably as being a very remarkable man, and
might come off well in the many trials [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] of skill to
which they would challenge him. Then, when they
were got together, [25] Alkinoos spoke:</p>
<p n="270" start-line="8.25" end-line="8.45">“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town
councilors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak
even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may
be, has found his way to my house from somewhere
or other either East or West. [30] He wants an
escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let
us then get one ready for him, as we have done for
others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet
came to my house has been able to complain of me
for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us
draw a ship into the sea— [35] one that has never
yet made a voyage—and man her with two and fifty
of our choicest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>krinein</foreign>] young sailors in the <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos.</foreign> Then when you
have made fast your oars each by his own seat,
leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a
feast. I will provide you with everything. [40] I
am giving these instructions to the young men who
will form the crew, for as regards you sceptered
kings, you will join me in entertaining our guest
in the halls. I can take no excuses, and we will
have Demodokos to sing to us; for there is no bard
like him [45] whatever he may choose to sing
about.”</p>
<p n="271" start-line="8.46" end-line="8.61">Alkinoos then led the way, and the others
followed after, while a herald [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kērux</foreign>] went to fetch
Demodokos. The fifty-two picked [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] oarsmen went to
the sea shore as they had been told, [50] and when
they got there they drew the ship into the water,
got her mast and sails inside her, bound the oars
to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather,
all in due course, and spread the white sails
aloft. [55] They moored the vessel a little way
out from land, and then came on shore and went to
the house of high-spirited King Alkinoos. The
outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were
filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both
old and young; and Alkinoos killed them a dozen
sheep, eight [60] full grown pigs, and two oxen.
These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a
magnificent banquet.</p>
<p n="272" start-line="8.62" end-line="8.71"><seg rend="subscript">62</seg> The herald came
near, bringing with him a singer, very
trusted, <seg rend="subscript">63</seg> whom the
Muse loved exceedingly. She gave him both a good
thing and a bad thing. <seg rend="subscript"
>64</seg> For she took away from him his eyes but
gave him the sweetness of song [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aoidē</foreign>]. [65] For him did
Pontonoos place a chair, silver studded, <seg
rend="subscript">66</seg> right in the midst of
the people who were feasting, propping the chair
against a tall column, <seg rend="subscript"
>67</seg> and the herald took from a peg the
clear-sounding phorminx that was hanging
there <seg rend="subscript">68</seg> above his
head, and he presented it to him so he could take
it in his hands. <seg rend="subscript"
>69</seg> The herald did this. And next to him he
[= the herald] put a beautiful basket and a table.
[70] He put next to him also a cup of wine to
drink from whenever he [= Demodokos] felt in his
heart the need to do so. <seg rend="subscript"
>71</seg> And, with hands reaching out swiftly,
they made for the good things that were prepared
and waiting.</p>
<p n="273" start-line="8.72" end-line="8.82"><seg rend="subscript">72</seg> When they had
satisfied their desire for drinking and
eating, <seg rend="subscript">73</seg> the Muse
impelled the singer to sing the glories [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign> plural] of
men, <seg rend="subscript">74</seg> starting from
a thread [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">oimē</foreign>]
[of a song] that had at that time a glory
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]
reaching all the way up to the vast sky. [75] It
was the quarrel [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>neikos</foreign>] of Odysseus and Achilles son of
Peleus, <seg rend="subscript">76</seg> how they
once upon a time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>pote</foreign>] fought at a sumptuous feast of
the gods, <seg rend="subscript">77</seg> with
terrible words, and the king of men,
Agamemnon, <seg rend="subscript">78</seg> was
happy in his mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] that the best of the Achaeans
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aristoi
Akhaiōn</foreign>] were fighting. <seg
rend="subscript">79</seg> For [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">gar</foreign>] thus had oracular
Phoebus Apollo prophesied to him, [80] at holy
Delphi, when he [Agamemnon] had crossed the stone
threshold <seg rend="subscript">81</seg> to
consult the oracle. For [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>gar</foreign>] then [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>tote</foreign>] it was that the beginning of pain
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pēma</foreign>] started
rolling down [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kulindesthai</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
>82</seg> upon both Trojans and Danaans [=
Achaeans], all on account of the plans [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">boulai</foreign>] of great
Zeus. <seg rend="subscript">83</seg> These things,
then, the singer sang, whose fame goes far and
wide.</p>
<p n="274" start-line="8.83" end-line="8.92">As for Odysseus <seg rend="subscript"
>84</seg> he took hold of his great purple cloak
in his powerful hands [85] and he pulled it over
his head, veiling that face of his with its comely
looks, <seg rend="subscript">86</seg> since he
felt shame in front of the Phaeacians as tears
started flowing from beneath his brows. <seg
rend="subscript">87</seg> And whenever the divine
singer would leave off [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>lēgein</foreign>] the singing, <seg
rend="subscript">88</seg> he would wipe away the
tears as he removed the cloak from his head, <seg
rend="subscript">89</seg> and, holding up a
drinking cup, he would offer a libation to the
gods. [90] But then, whenever he [= the singer]
started [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>arkhesthai</foreign>] singing all over again
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aps</foreign>], urged to
do so <seg rend="subscript">91</seg> by the best
of the Phaeacians, since they took delight
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">terpesthai</foreign>] in
the words of his song, <seg rend="subscript"
>92</seg> Odysseus would veil his head and start
lamenting [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>goân</foreign>] all over again.</p>
<p n="275" start-line="8.93" end-line="8.103"><seg rend="subscript">93</seg> So there he was,
escaping the notice of all while he kept pouring
out his tears [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dakrua</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>94</seg> But Alkinoos was the only one of all of
them who was aware, and he took note [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>]; [95] he was
sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that
he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and
town councilors of the oar-loving Phaeacians, we
have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the
minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; [100]
let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], so
that our guest on his return home may be able to
tell his friends how much we surpass all other
nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and
runners.”</p>
<p n="276" start-line="8.104" end-line="8.119">With these words he led the way, and the others
followed after. [105] A servant hung Demodokos’
lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the hall,
and set him on the same way as that along which
all the chief men of the Phaeacians were going to
see the sports; a crowd of several thousand people
followed them, [110] and there were many excellent
competitors for all the prizes: Akroneos, Okyalos,
Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Ankhialos, Eretmeus,
Ponteus, Proreus, Thoön, Anabesineos, and
Amphialos, son of Polyneos, son of Tekton. [115]
There was also Euryalos, son of Naubolos, who was
like manslaughtering Arēs himself, and was the
best looking man among the Phaeacians except
Laodamas. Three sons of stately Alkinoos, stately
Laodamas, Halios, and godlike Klytoneus, competed
also.</p>
<p n="277" start-line="8.120" end-line="8.139">[120] The foot races came first. The course was
set out for them from the starting post, and they
raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew
forward at the same moment. Stately Klytoneus came
in first by a long way; he left every one else
behind him by the length of the furrow that a
couple of mules can plow [125] in a fallow field.
They then turned to the painful art of wrestling,
and here Euryalos proved to be the best man.
Amphialos excelled all the others in jumping,
while at throwing the disc there was no one who
could approach Elatreus. [130] Alkinoos’ fine son
Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who
presently said, when they had all been diverted
with the games [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>], “Let us ask the stranger
whether he excels in any of these sports [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>]; he seems very
powerfully built; [135] his thighs, calves, hands,
and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at
all old, but he has suffered much lately, and
there is nothing like the sea for making havoc
with a man, no matter how strong he is.”</p>
<p n="278" start-line="8.140" end-line="8.142">[140] “You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied
Euryalos, “go up to your guest and speak to him
about it yourself.”</p>
<p n="279" start-line="8.143" end-line="8.151">When Laodamas heard this he made his way into
the middle of the crowd and said to Odysseus,
[145] “I hope, sir, that you will enter yourself
in some one or other of our competitions [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthloi</foreign>] if you are
skilled in any of them—for you seem to know of
sports [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthloi</foreign>]. There is no greater <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign> for a man all his
life long as the showing himself good with his
hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something,
and banish all sorrow from your mind. [150] Your
return home will not be long delayed, for the ship
is already drawn into the water, and the crew is
found.”</p>
<p n="280" start-line="8.152" end-line="8.157">Resourceful Odysseus answered, “Laodamas, why
do you taunt me in this way? My mind is set rather
on cares than contests [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthloi</foreign>]; [155] I have been through
infinite trouble, and am come among you now as a
suppliant, praying your king and people [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] to further my
homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="281" start-line="8.158" end-line="8.164">Then Euryalos reviled him outright and said, “I
gather, then, that you are unskilled [160] in any
of the many sports [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthloi</foreign>] that men generally delight in.
I suppose you are one of those grasping traders
that go about in ships as captains or merchants,
and who think of nothing but of their outward
freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem
to be much of the athlete [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlētēs</foreign>] about
you.”</p>
<p n="282" start-line="8.165" end-line="8.185">[165] “For shame, sir,” answered resourceful
Odysseus, fiercely, “you are an insolent man—so
true is it that the gods do not grace all men
alike in speech, person, and understanding. One
man may be of weak presence, [170] but the gods
have adorned him with such a good conversation
that he charms every one who sees him; his honeyed
moderation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aidōs</foreign>] carries his hearers with him so
that he is leader in all assemblies of his
fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to.
Another may be as handsome as a god, [175] but his
good looks are not crowned with verbal grace
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>]. This
is your case. No god could make a finer looking
man than you are, but you are empty with respect
to <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>. Your
ill-judged [= without <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kosmos</foreign>] remarks have made me
exceedingly angry, for I excel [180] in a great
many athletic exercises [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>]; indeed, so long as I had youth
and strength, I was among the first athletes of
the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labor and
sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the
field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea;
still, in spite of all this I will engage in the
competition [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>], [185] for your taunts have
stung me to the quick.”</p>
<p n="283" start-line="8.186" end-line="8.198">So he hurried up without even taking his cloak
off, and seized a disc, larger, more massive and
much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians
when disc-throwing among themselves. Then,
swinging it back, he threw it from his brawny
hand, [190] and it made a humming sound in the air
as he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the
rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from
his hand, and flew beyond any mark [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] that had been made
yet. Athena, in the form of a man, came and marked
the place where it had fallen. [195] “A blind man,
sir,” said she, “could easily tell your mark
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] by
groping for it—it is so far ahead of any other.
You may make your mind easy about this contest
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], for
no Phaeacian can come near to such a throw as
yours.”</p>
<p n="284" start-line="8.199" end-line="8.233">Much-enduring great Odysseus was glad [200]
when he found he had a friend among the
lookers-on, so he began to speak more pleasantly.
“Young men,” said he, “come up to that throw if
you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or
even heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with
me [205] let him come on, for I am exceedingly
angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care
what it is, with any man of you all except
Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest,
and one cannot compete with one’s own personal
friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a
sensible thing [210] for a guest to challenge his
host’s family at any game [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], especially when
he is in a foreign <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>. He will cut the ground from
under his own feet if he does; but I make no
exception as regards any one else, for I want to
have the matter out and know which is the best
man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic
sport [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>]
known among humankind. [215] I am an excellent
archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a
man down with my arrow, no matter how many more
are taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes
was the only man who could shoot better than I
could [220] when we Achaeans were before
the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign> of
the Trojans. I far excel every one else in the
whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the
face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot
against the mighty dead, such as Hēraklēs, or
Eurytos of Oikhalia— [225] men who could shoot
against the gods themselves. This in fact was how
great Eurytos came prematurely by his end, for
Apollo was angry with him and killed him because
he challenged him as an archer. I can throw a dart
farther than any one else can shoot an arrow.
[230] Running is the only point in respect of
which I am afraid some of the Phaeacians might
beat me, for I have been brought down very low at
sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am

<p n="285" start-line="8.234" end-line="8.265">They all held their peace [235] except King
Alkinoos, who began, “Sir, we have had much
pleasure in hearing all that you have told us,
from which I understand that you are willing to
show your prowess [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>], as having been displeased with
some insolent remarks that have been made to you
by one of our athletes, and which could never have
been uttered [240] by any one who knows how to
talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my
meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief
men who may be dining with yourself and your
family when you get home, that we have an
hereditary aptitude [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>] [245] for accomplishments of all
kinds. We are not particularly remarkable for our
boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are
singularly fleet of foot and are excellent
sailors. <seg rend="subscript">248</seg> Dear to
us always is feasting [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dais</foreign>], also the kitharis, and occasions
of singing and dancing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>khoroi</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
>249</seg> also the changing of costumes from one
occasion to the next, also warm baths and lying
around in bed. [250] Let’s get started. I want the
best of the Phaeacian acrobatic dancers [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">bētarmones</foreign>] <seg
rend="subscript">251</seg> to perform their
sportive dance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>paizein</foreign>], so that the stranger, our
guest, will be able to tell his near-and-dear
ones, <seg rend="subscript">252</seg>when he gets
home, how much better we (Phaeacians) are than
anyone else <seg rend="subscript">253</seg> in
sailing and in footwork, in dance and song. <seg
rend="subscript">254</seg> One of you go and get
for Demodokos the clear-sounding phorminx, [255]
bringing it to him. It is in the palace
somewhere.” <seg rend="subscript">256</seg> Thus
spoke Alkinoos, the one who looks like the gods,
and the herald [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kērux</foreign>] got up, <seg rend="subscript"
>257</seg> ready to bring the well carved phorminx
from the palace of the king. <seg rend="subscript"
>258</seg> And the organizers [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aisumnētai</foreign>], the nine
selectmen, all got up <seg rend="subscript"
>259</seg> —they belonged to the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]—and
they started arranging everything according to the
rules of the competition [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>agōn</foreign>]. [260] They made smooth the place
of the singing and dancing [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>], and they made a
wide space of competition [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>]. <seg
rend="subscript">261</seg> The herald [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kērux</foreign>] came near,
bringing the clear-sounding phorminx <seg
rend="subscript">262</seg> for Demodokos. He moved
to the center of the space. At his right and at
his left were boys [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kouroi</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
>263</seg> in the first stage of adolescence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">prōthēboi</foreign>],
standing there, well versed in dancing [<foreign

rend="subscript">264</seg> They pounded out with
their feet a dance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>khoros</foreign>], a thing of wonder, and
Odysseus [265] was observing the sparkling
footwork. He was amazed in his heart [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>].</p>
<p n="286" start-line="8.266" end-line="8.288"><seg rend="subscript">266</seg> And he [=
Demodokos], playing on the phorminx [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">phormizein</foreign>], started
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">anaballesthai</foreign>]
singing beautifully <seg rend="subscript"
>267</seg> about [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>amphi</foreign>] the bonding [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">philotēs</foreign>] of Arēs and of
Aphrodite, the one with the beautiful garlands
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>stephanoi</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
>268</seg> about how they, at the very beginning,
mated with each other in the palace of
Hephaistos, <seg rend="subscript">269</seg> in
secret Arēs made Aphrodite many presents, and
defiled [270] lord Hephaistos’ marriage bed, so
the sun, who saw what they were about, told
Hephaistos. Hephaistos was very angry when he
heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy
brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its
place, and began to forge some chains [275] which
none could either unloose or break, so that they
might stay there in that place. When he had
finished his snare he went into his bedroom and
festooned the bed-posts all over [280] with chains
like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the
great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god could
see them, so fine and subtle were they. As soon as
he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made
as though he were setting out for the fair state
of strong-founded Lemnos, which of all places in
the world was the one he was most fond of. [285]
But Arēs kept no blind look out, and as soon as he
saw him start, hurried off to his house, burning
with love for sweet-garlanded Aphrodite.</p>
<p n="287" start-line="8.289" end-line="8.294">Now Aphrodite was just come in from a visit
[290] to her father Zeus, the powerful son of
Kronos, and was about sitting down when Arēs came
inside the house, and said as he took her hand in
his own, “Let us go to the couch of Hephaistos: he
is not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among
the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous.”</p>
<p n="288" start-line="8.295" end-line="8.304">[295] She was not unwilling, so they went to
the couch to take their rest, whereon they were
caught in the toils which cunning Hephaistos had
spread for them, and could neither get up nor stir
hand or foot, but found too late that they were in
a trap. [300] Then glorious Hephaistos of the
strong arms came up to them, for he had turned
back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the
sun told him what was going on. He was in a
furious passion, [305] and stood in the vestibule
making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the
gods.</p>
<p n="289" start-line="8.305" end-line="8.320">“Father Zeus,” he cried, “and all you other
blessed gods who live for ever, come here and see
the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will
show you. Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite is always
dishonoring me because I am lame. She is in love
with ruinous Arēs, [310] who is handsome and clean
built, whereas I am a cripple—but my parents are
responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aitioi</foreign>] for that, not I; they ought
never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair
together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to
look at them. [315] They are very fond of one
another, but I do not think they will lie there
longer than they can help, nor do I think that
they will sleep much; there, however, they shall
stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave
him for his bitch-eyed daughter, [320] who is fair
but not honest.”</p>
<p n="290" start-line="8.321" end-line="8.328">Then the gods gathered to the house of
Hephaistos. Earth-encircling Poseidon came, and
kindly Hermes, the bringer of luck, and lord
Apollo, but the goddesses stayed at home all of
them for shame. [325] Then the givers of all good
things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods
roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw
how cunning Hephaistos had been, whereon one would
turn towards his neighbor saying:</p>
<p n="291" start-line="8.329" end-line="8.332">“Ill deeds do not bring excellence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>], and the weak
[330] confound the strong. See how limping
Hephaistos, lame as he is, has caught Arēs who is
the fleetest god in the sky; and now Arēs will be
cast in heavy damages.”</p>
<p n="292" start-line="8.333" end-line="8.337">Thus did they converse, but lord Apollo said to
Hermes, [335] “Messenger Hermes, giver of good
things, you would not care how strong the chains
were, would you, if you could sleep with Aphrodite
the golden?”</p>
<p n="293" start-line="8.338" end-line="8.342">“King Apollo,” answered Hermes, “I only wish
[340] I might get the chance, though there were
three times as many chains—and you might look on,
all of you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep
with her if I could.”</p>
<p n="294" start-line="8.343" end-line="8.348">The immortal gods burst out laughing as they
heard him, but Poseidon took it all seriously, and
kept on imploring [345] Hephaistos to set Arēs
free again. “Let him go,” he cried, “and I will
undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you
all the damages that are held reasonable among the
immortal gods.”</p>
<p n="295" start-line="8.349" end-line="8.353">“Do not,” replied renowned Hephaistos of the
strong arms, [350] “ask me to do this; a bad man’s
bond is bad security; what remedy could I enforce
against you if Arēs should go away and leave his
debts behind him along with his chains?”</p>
<p n="296" start-line="8.354" end-line="8.358">“Hephaistos,” said Poseidon, shaker of the
Earth, [355] “if Arēs goes away without paying his
damages, I will pay you myself.” So mighty
Hephaistos answered, “In this case I cannot and
must not refuse you.”</p>
<p n="297" start-line="8.359" end-line="8.366">Then he loosed the bonds that bound them, [360]
and as soon as they were free they scampered off,
Arēs to Thrace and laughter-loving Aphrodite to
Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her
altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here the
Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of
ambrosia [365] such as the immortal gods make use
of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most
enchanting beauty.</p>
<p n="298" start-line="8.367" end-line="8.369"><seg rend="subscript">367</seg> These things,
then, the singer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aoidos</foreign>] was singing [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aeidein]</foreign>, that very
famous singer. As for Odysseus, <seg
rend="subscript">368</seg> he felt delight
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">terpesthai</foreign>] in
his heart as he was listening—and so too did all
the others feel, <seg rend="subscript"
>369</seg> the Phaeacians, those men with their
long oars, men famed for their ships.</p>
<p n="299" start-line="8.370" end-line="8.380">[370] Then Alkinoos told Laodamas and Halios to
dance alone, for there was no one to compete with
them. So they took a red ball which Polybos, the
skilled craftsman, had made for them, and one of
them bent himself backwards and threw it up
towards the clouds, [375] while the other jumped
from off the ground and caught it with ease before
it came down again. When they had done throwing
the ball straight up into the air they began to
dance, and at the same time kept on throwing it
backwards and forwards to one another, while all
the young men [380] in the ring applauded and made
a great stamping with their feet. Then great
Odysseus said:</p>
<p n="300" start-line="8.381" end-line="8.384">“King Alkinoos, pre-eminent among all people,
you said your people were the nimblest dancers in
the world, and indeed they have proved themselves
to be so. I was astonished as I saw them.”</p>
<p n="301" start-line="8.385" end-line="8.397">[385] The hallowed king was delighted at this,
and exclaimed to the oar-loving Phaeacians
“Aldermen and town councilors, our guest seems to
be a person of singular judgment; let us give him
such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably
expect. [390] There are twelve chief men
throughout the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>, and counting myself there are
thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak,
a khiton, and a talent of fine gold; let us give
him all this in a lump down at once, [395] so that
when he gets his supper he may do so with a light
heart. As for Euryalos, he will have to make a
formal apology and a present too, for he has been
rude.”</p>
<p n="302" start-line="8.398" end-line="8.405">Thus did he speak. The others all of them
applauded his saying, and sent their servants to
fetch the presents. [400] Then Euryalos said,
“Great King Alkinoos, I will give the stranger all
the satisfaction you require. He shall have a
sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which
is of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of
newly sawn ivory [405] into which it fits. It will
be worth a great deal to him.”</p>
<p n="303" start-line="8.406" end-line="8.411">As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of
Odysseus and said, “Good luck to you, father
stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the
winds blow it away [410] with them, and may the
gods grant you a safe return, for I understand you
have been long away from home, and have gone
through much hardship.”</p>
<p n="304" start-line="8.412" end-line="8.415">To which resourceful Odysseus answered, “Good
luck to you too my friend, and may the gods grant
you every happiness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbos</foreign>]. I hope you will not miss the
sword you have given [415] me along with your
apology.”</p>
<p n="305" start-line="8.416" end-line="8.422">With these words he girded the sword about his
shoulders and towards sundown the presents began
to make their appearance, as the servants of the
donors kept bringing them to the house of King
Alkinoos; here his sons [420] received them, and
placed them under their mother’s charge. Then
Alkinoos led the way to the house and bade his
guests take their seats.</p>
<p n="306" start-line="8.423" end-line="8.432">“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go,
fetch the best chest we have, [425] and put a
clean cloak and khiton in it. Also, set a copper
on the fire and heat some water; our guest will
take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing
of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have
made him <seg rend="subscript">429</seg> so that
he [= Odysseus] might take delight [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">terpesthai</foreign>] in the feast
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dais</foreign>] and in
listening to the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>humnos</foreign> of the song. [430] I shall
myself give him this golden goblet—which is of
exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of
me for the rest of his life whenever he makes a
drink-offering to Zeus, or to any of the
gods.”</p>
<p n="307" start-line="8.433" end-line="8.442">Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod
upon the fire as fast as they could, [435] whereon
they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear
fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and
the water became hot as the flame played about the
belly of the tripod. Meanwhile Arete brought a
magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it
she packed all the beautiful presents [440] of
gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought.
Lastly she added a cloak and a good khiton from
Alkinoos, and said to Odysseus:</p>
<p n="308" start-line="8.443" end-line="8.445">“See to the lid yourself, and have the whole
bound round at once, for fear any one should rob
you [445] by the way when you are asleep in your
ship.”</p>
<p n="309" start-line="8.446" end-line="8.460">When long-suffering great Odysseus heard this
he put the lid on the chest and made it fast with
a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so
before an upper servant told him to come [450] to
the bath and wash himself. He was very glad of a
warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him
ever since he left the house of fair-haired
Kalypsō, who as long as he remained with her had
taken as good care of him as though he had been a
god. When the servants had done washing and
anointing him with oil, [455] and had given him a
clean cloak and khiton, he left the bathing room
and joined the guests who were sitting over their
wine. Lovely Nausicaa, with the gods’ loveliness
on her, stood by one of the bearing-posts
supporting the roof of the hall, and admired him
as she saw him pass. [460] “Farewell stranger,”
said she, “do not forget me when you are safe at
home again, for it is to me first that you owe a
ransom for having saved your life.”</p>
<p n="310" start-line="8.461" end-line="8.468">And resourceful Odysseus said, “Nausicaa,
daughter of great-hearted Alkinoos, [465] may
Zeus, the mighty, high-thundering husband of Hera,
grant that I may reach my home and see my day of
homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>]; so shall I bless you as a
goddess all my days, for it was you who saved
me.”</p>
<p n="311" start-line="8.469" end-line="8.483">When he had said this, he seated himself beside
Alkinoos. [470] Supper was then served, and the
wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the
favorite bard, Demodokos, and set him in the midst
of the company, near one of the bearing-posts
supporting the hall, that he might lean against
it. [475] Then resourceful Odysseus cut off a
piece of roast pork with plenty of fat (for there
was abundance left on the joint) and said to a
servant, “Take this piece of pork over to
Demodokos and tell him to eat it; for all the pain
his lays may cause me I will salute him none the
less; bards are honored [480] and get respect
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>]
throughout the world, for the Muse teaches them
their songs and loves them.”</p>
<p n="312" start-line="8.484" end-line="8.498">The servant carried the pork in his fingers
over to the hero Demodokos, who took it and was
very much pleased. They then laid their hands on
the good things that were before them. [485] When
they had satisfied their desire for drinking and
eating, <seg rend="subscript">486</seg> then
Odysseus, the one with many a stratagem, addressed
Demodokos: <seg rend="subscript"
>487</seg> “Demodokos, I admire and pointedly
praise you, more than any other human. <seg
rend="subscript">488</seg> Either the Muse, child
of Zeus, taught you, or Apollo. <seg
rend="subscript">489</seg> All too well, in accord
with its <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kosmos</foreign>, do you sing the fate of the
Achaeans [490] —all the things the Achaeans did
and all the things that were done to them, and
they suffered for it— <seg rend="subscript"
>491</seg> you sing it as if you yourself had been
present or had heard it from someone else. <seg
rend="subscript">492</seg> But come now, move
ahead and shift forward [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>metabainein</foreign>] and sing the <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign> of the
horse, <seg rend="subscript">493</seg> the wooden
horse that Epeios made with the help of
Athena, <seg rend="subscript">494</seg> the one
that Odysseus, the radiant one, once upon a time
took to the acropolis as a stratagem, [495] having
filled it with men, who ransacked Ilion. <seg
rend="subscript">496</seg>. If you can tell me in
due order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>katalegein</foreign>], in accord with proper
apportioning [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>moira</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
>497</seg> then right away I will say the
authoritative word [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mūthos</foreign>] to all mortals: <seg
rend="subscript">498</seg> I will say, and I see
it as I say it, that the god, favorably disposed
toward you, granted you a divinely sounding
song.”</p>
<p n="313" start-line="8.499" end-line="8.520"><seg rend="subscript">499</seg> And he [=
Demodokos], setting his point of departure
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hormētheis</foreign>],
started [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>arkhesthai</foreign>] from the god. And he made
visible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>phainein</foreign>] the song, [500] taking it
from the point where they [= the Achaeans],
boarding their ships with the strong benches, <seg
rend="subscript">501</seg>sailed away, setting
their tents on fire. <seg rend="subscript"
>502</seg> That is what some of the Argives [=
Achaeans] were doing. But others of them were in
the company of Odysseus most famed, and they were
already <seg rend="subscript">503</seg> sitting
hidden inside the Horse, which was now in the
meeting place of the Trojans. <seg
rend="subscript">504</seg> The Trojans themselves
had pulled the Horse into the acropolis. [505] So
there it was, standing there, and they talked a
great deal about it, in doubt about what to
do, <seg rend="subscript">506</seg> sitting around
it. There were three different plans: <seg
rend="subscript">507</seg> to split the hollow
wood with pitiless bronze, <seg rend="subscript"
>508</seg> or to drag it to the heights and push
it down from the rocks, <seg rend="subscript"
>509</seg> or to leave it, great artifact that it
was, a charm [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thelktērion</foreign>] of the gods [510] —which,
I now see it, was exactly the way it was going to
end [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>teleutân</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
>511</seg> because it was fate [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aisa</foreign>] that the place
would be destroyed, once the city had enfolded in
itself <seg rend="subscript">512</seg> the great
Wooden Horse, when all the best men were sitting
inside it, <seg rend="subscript">513</seg> the
Argives [= Achaeans], that is, bringing slaughter
and destruction upon the Trojans. <seg
rend="subscript">514</seg> He sang how the sons of
the Achaeans destroyed the city, [515] pouring out
of the Horse, leaving behind the hollow place of
ambush. <seg rend="subscript">516</seg> He sang
how the steep citadel was destroyed by different
men in different places. <seg rend="subscript"
>517</seg> —how Odysseus went to the palace of
Deiphobos, <seg rend="subscript">518</seg> how he
was looking like Arēs, and godlike Menelaos went
with him, <seg rend="subscript">519</seg> and how
in that place, I now see it, he [= Demodokos] said
that he [= Odysseus] dared to go through the worst
part of the war, [520] and how he emerged
victorious after that, with the help of Athena,
the one with the mighty heart [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>].</p>
<p n="314" start-line="8.521" end-line="8.534"><seg rend="subscript">521</seg> So these were
the things that the singer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aoidos</foreign>] most famed was
singing. As for Odysseus, <seg rend="subscript"
>522</seg> he dissolved [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>tēkesthai</foreign>] into tears. He made wet his
cheeks with the tears flowing from his
eyelids, <seg rend="subscript">523</seg> just as a
woman cries, falling down and embracing her dear
husband, <seg rend="subscript">524</seg> who fell
in front of the city and people he was defending,
[525] trying to ward off the pitiless day of doom
that is hanging over the city and its
children. <seg rend="subscript">526</seg> She sees
him dying, gasping for his last breath, <seg
rend="subscript">527</seg> and she pours herself
all over him as she wails with a piercing cry. But
there are men behind her, <seg rend="subscript"
>528</seg> prodding her with their spears, hurting
her back and shoulders, <seg rend="subscript"
>529</seg> and they bring for her a life of
bondage, which will give her pain and sorrow.
[530] Her cheeks are wasting away with a sorrow
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] that is
most pitiful [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>eleeinon</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>531</seg> So also did Odysseus pour out a piteous
tear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dakruon</foreign>]
from beneath his brows; <seg rend="subscript"
>532</seg> there he was, escaping the notice of
all while he kept pouring out his tears [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dakrua</foreign>]. <seg
rend="subscript">533</seg> But Alkinoos was the
only one of all of them who was aware, and he took
note [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>].
[535] The king, therefore, at once rose and
said:</p>
<p n="315" start-line="8.535" end-line="8.547">“Aldermen and town councilors of the oar-loving
Phaeacians, <seg rend="subscript">537</seg> It is
high time for Demodokos to hold off and stop the
song of that lyre of his with its clear
sound. <seg rend="subscript">538</seg> I say that
because the beauty and the pleasure he gives
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharizestai</foreign>]
as he sings these things does not at all extend to
everyone here. <seg rend="subscript">539</seg> As
soon as we began dining and as soon as the divine
singer got started, [540] ever since then there
has been no pause in grief-filled lamentation
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">goos</foreign>] on the
part of this one, <seg rend="subscript"
>541</seg> I mean, on the part of this guest here.
It seems to me that sorrow [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] has overcome his
thinking, very much so. <seg rend="subscript"
>542</seg> This one [= the singer] must now hold
off [on his singing], so that we may take delight
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">terpesthai</foreign>]
all together <seg rend="subscript">543</seg> —I
mean, not only we as the hosts but also he as the
guest. It would be much more beautiful that way.
For all these festivities, with the escort and the
presents that we are making with so much good
will, are wholly in his honor, [545] and any one
with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows
that he ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as
though he were his own brother.</p>
<p n="316" start-line="8.548" end-line="8.571">Therefore, sir, do you on your part affect no
more concealment nor reserve in the matter about
which I shall ask you; it will be more polite in
you to give me a plain answer; [550] tell me the
name by which your father and mother over yonder
used to call you, and by which you were known
among your neighbors and fellow-townspeople. There
is no one, neither rich nor poor, who is
absolutely without any name whatever, for people’s
fathers and mothers give them names as soon as
they are born. [555] Tell me also your country,
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], and city, that our ships may
shape their purpose accordingly and take you
there. For the Phaeacians have no pilots; their
vessels have no rudders as those of other nations
have, but the ships themselves understand what it
is that we are thinking about and want; [560] they
know all the cities and countries in the whole
world, and can traverse the sea just as well even
when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that
there is no danger of being wrecked or coming to
any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father
say [565] that Poseidon was angry with us for
being too easy-going in the matter of giving
people escorts. He said that one of these days he
should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning
from having escorted some one, and bury our city
under a high mountain. [570] That is what the old
man said. And the god [Poseidon] could either
bring these things to fulfillment <seg
rend="subscript">571</seg> or they could be left
unfulfilled, however it was pleasing to his
heart.</p>
<p n="317" start-line="8.572" end-line="8.586">And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have
you been wandering, and in what countries have you
traveled? Tell us of the peoples themselves, [575]
and of their cities—who were hostile, savage and
uncivilized [non-<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikaios</foreign>], and who, on the other hand,
hospitable and endowed with a god-fearing mind
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]. <seg
rend="subscript">577</seg> Tell us why you are
weeping and lamenting in your heart [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] <seg
rend="subscript">578</seg> when you hear the fate
of the Argive Danaans [= Achaeans] or the fate of
Troy. <seg rend="subscript">579</seg> The gods
arranged all this, and they wove the fate of doom
[580] for mortals, so that future generations
might have something to sing about. <seg
rend="subscript">581</seg> Did you lose some
kinsman of your wife’s when you were at Troy? <seg
rend="subscript">582</seg>Some such noble person?
Or a son-in-law or father-in-law? Such people are
most certainly <seg rend="subscript">583</seg> the
nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh
and blood. <seg rend="subscript">584</seg> Or was
it perhaps a comrade [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hetairos</foreign>] who was well aware of the
things that were most pleasing to you? [585] Some
such noble person? For not any less prized than
your own brother <seg rend="subscript"
>586</seg> is a comrade [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hetairos</foreign>] who is well aware of things
you think about.”</p>

tables that are filled <seg rend="subscript"

mixing bowl is drawn [10] by the one who pours the
wine and takes it around, pouring it into their
cups. <seg rend="subscript">11</seg> This kind of
thing, as I see it in my way of thinking, is the
most beautiful thing in the whole world. Now,
however, since you are inclined to ask the story
of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in
respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor
yet how to continue and conclude my tale, [15] for
the hand of the gods has been laid heavily upon
me.</p>
<p n="319" start-line="9.16" end-line="9.36">Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you
too may know it, and that one day, if I outlive
this time of sorrow, I may become a guest-friend
to you, though I live so far away from all of
you. <seg rend="subscript">19</seg> I am Odysseus
son of Laertes, and I, with all [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pāsi</foreign>] my acts of
trickery, [20] I-am-on-the-minds-of [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">melō</foreign>] all [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pāsi</foreign>] humans, and my
glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]
reaches all the way up to the sky. I live in
Ithaca, where there is a high mountain called
Neriton, covered with forests; and not far from it
there is a group of islands very near to one
another—Doulikhion, Samē, and the wooded island of
Zakynthos. [25] It lies squat on the horizon, all
highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while
the others lie away from it towards dawn. It is a
rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my
eyes know none that they better love to look upon.
The goddess Kalypsō, shining among divinities,
kept me [30] with her in her cave, and wanted me
to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean
goddess Circe; but they could neither of them
persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man
than his own country and his parents, [35] and
however splendid a home he may have in a foreign
country, if it be far from father or mother, he
does not care about it.</p>
<p n="320" start-line="9.37" end-line="9.61">Now, however, I will tell you of the many
hazardous adventures which by Zeus’ will I met
with on my return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] from Troy. When I had set sail
thence the wind took me first to Ismaros, [40]
which is the city of the Kikones. There I
ransacked the town and put the people to the
sword. We took their wives and also much booty,
which we divided equitably amongst us, so that
none might have reason to complain. I then said
that we had better make off at once, but my men
very foolishly would not obey me, [45] so they
stayed there drinking much wine and killing great
numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore.
Meanwhile the Kikones cried out for help to other
Kikones who lived inland. These were more in
number, and stronger, and they were more skilled
in the art of war, for they could fight, [50]
either from chariots or on foot as the occasion
served; in the morning, therefore, they came as
thick as leaves and bloom in summertime [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>], and the hand of
the gods was against us, so that we were hard
pressed. They set the battle in array near the
[55] ships, and the armies aimed their bronze-shod
spears at one another. So long as the day waxed
and it was still morning, we held our own against
them, though they were more in number than we; but
as the sun went down, towards the time when men
let loose their oxen, the Kikones got the better
of us, [60] and we lost half a dozen men from
every ship we had; so we got away with those that
were left.</p>
<p n="321" start-line="9.62" end-line="9.81">Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our
hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we
had lost our comrades, nor did we leave [65] till
we had thrice invoked each one of the poor men who
had perished by the hands of the Kikones. Then
cloud-gathering Zeus raised the North wind against
us till it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky
were hidden in thick clouds, and night sprang
forth out of the sky. [70] We let the ships run
before the gale, but the force of the wind tore
our sails to tatters, so we took them down for
fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards
the land. There we lay two days and two nights
suffering [75] much alike from toil and distress
of mind, but on the morning of the third day we
again raised our masts, set sail, and took our
places, letting the wind and steersmen [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>] direct our
ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed
[80] had not the North wind and the currents been
against me as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set
me off my course hard by the island of
Cythera.</p>
<p n="322" start-line="9.82" end-line="9.104">I was driven thence by foul winds for a space
of nine days upon the sea, but on the tenth day we
reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who live on
a food that comes from a kind of flower. [85] Here
we landed to take in fresh water, and our crews
got their mid-day meal on the shore near the
ships. When they had eaten and drunk [90] I chose
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] two
of my company to go see what manner of men the
people of the place might be, and they had a third
man under them. They started at once, and went
about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no
harm, but gave them to eat of the lotus, which was
so delicious that those who ate of it [95] left
off caring about home, and did not even want to go
back and say what had happened to them, but were
for staying and munching lotus with the
Lotus-eaters without thinking further of
their <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>;
nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced
them back to the ships and made them [100] fast
under the benches. Then I told the rest to go on
board at once, lest any of them should taste of
the lotus and leave off wanting to get home
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], so
they took their places and smote the gray sea with
their oars.</p>
<p n="323" start-line="9.105" end-line="9.115">[105] We sailed hence, always in much distress,
till we came to the land of the lawless and
inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant
nor plow, but trust in providence, and live on
such [110] wheat, barley, and grapes as grow wild
without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes
yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow
them. They have no laws nor assemblies of the
people, but live in caves on the tops of high
mountains; each is lord and master [115] in his
family, and they take no account of their
neighbors.</p>
<p n="324" start-line="9.116" end-line="9.141">Now off their harbor there lies a wooded and
fertile island not quite close to the land of the
Cyclopes, but still not far. It is overrun with
wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and
are never disturbed by foot of man; [120] for
sportsmen—who as a rule will suffer so much
hardship in forest or among mountain precipices—do
not go there, nor yet again is it ever plowed or
fed down, but it lies a wilderness untilled and
unsown from year to year, and has no living thing
upon it but only goats. [125] For the Cyclopes
have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who could make
ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city
to city, or sail over the sea to one another’s
country as people who have ships can do; [130] if
they had had these they would have colonized the
island, for it is a very good one, and would yield
everything in due season. There are meadows that
in some places come right down to the sea shore,
well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes
would do there excellently; there is level land
for plowing, and it would always yield heavily
[135] at harvest time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hōrā</foreign>], for the soil is deep. There is a
good harbor where no cables are wanted, nor yet
anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one
has to do is to beach one’s vessel and stay there
till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea
again. [140] At the head of the harbor there is a
spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and
there are poplars growing all round it.</p>
<p n="325" start-line="9.142" end-line="9.151">Here we entered, but so dark was the night that
some god must have brought us in, for there was
nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist hung all
round our ships; the moon [145] was hidden behind
a mass of clouds so that no one could have seen
the island if he had looked for it, nor were there
any breakers to tell us we were close in shore
before we found ourselves upon the land itself;
when, however, we had beached the ships, we took
down the sails, [150] went ashore and camped upon
the beach till daybreak.</p>
<p n="326" start-line="9.152" end-line="9.171">When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, we admired the island and wandered all
over it, while the nymphs, Zeus of the aegis’
daughters, [155] roused the wild goats that we
might get some meat for our dinner. Then we
fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the
ships, and dividing ourselves into three bands
began to shoot the goats. Heaven sent us excellent
sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship
got nine goats, [160] while my own ship had ten;
thus through the livelong day to the going down of
the sun we ate and drank our fill—and we had
plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken
[165] many jars full when we ransacked the city of
the Kikones, and this had not yet run out. While
we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards
the land of the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and
saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could
almost fancy we heard their voices and the
bleating of their sheep and goats, but when the
sun went down and it came on dark, we camped down
upon the beach, [170] and next morning I called a
council.</p>
<p n="327" start-line="9.172" end-line="9.176">‘Stay here, my brave men,’ said I, ‘all the
rest of you, while I go with my ship and make
trial of these people myself: [175] I want to see
if they are uncivilized [= not <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>] savages, or a
population that is hospitable and endowed with a
god-fearing <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>.’</p>
<p n="328" start-line="9.177" end-line="9.192">I went on board, bidding my men to do so also
and loose the hawsers; [180] so they took their
places and smote the gray sea with their oars.
When we got to the land, which was not far, there,
on the face of a cliff near the sea, we saw a
great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station
for a great many sheep and goats, and outside
there was a large yard, [185] with a high wall
round it made of stones built into the ground and
of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of
a huge monster who was then away from home
shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to
do with other people, but led the life of an
outlaw. [190] He was a horrid creature, not like a
human being at all, but resembling rather some
crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the
top of a high mountain.</p>
<p n="329" start-line="9.193" end-line="9.215">I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay
where they were, [195] all but the twelve best
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] among
them, who were to go along with myself. I also
took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been
given me by Maron, son of Euanthes, who was priest
of Apollo, the patron god of Ismaros, and lived
within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we
were ransacking the city we respected him, and
spared his life, as also his wife and child; [200]
so he made me some presents of great value—seven
talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with
twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, [205] and of
the most exquisite flavor. Not a man nor maid in
the house knew about it, but only himself, his
wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he
mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, [210]
and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so
exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from
drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine,
and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for
my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with
some savage who would be of great strength, [215]
and would respect neither right [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign>] nor law.</p>
<p n="330" start-line="9.216" end-line="9.230">We soon reached his cave, but he was out
shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of
all that we could see. His cheese-racks were
loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and
kids than his pens could hold. [220] They were
kept in separate flocks; first there were the
piglets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and
lastly the very young ones all kept apart from one
another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls,
and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming
with whey. When they saw all this, my men begged
me [225] to let them first steal some cheeses, and
make off with them to the ship; they would then
return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on
board and sail away with them. It would have been
indeed better if we had done so but I would not
listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner
himself, in the hope that he might give me a
present. [230] When, however, we saw him my poor
men found him ill to deal with.</p>
<p n="331" start-line="9.231" end-line="9.251">We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in
sacrifice, ate others of them, and then sat
waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his
sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge
load of dry firewood to light the fire for his
supper, [235] and this he flung with such a noise
on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves
for fear at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile
he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the
she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving the
males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the
yards. Then [240] he rolled a huge stone to the
mouth of the cave—so huge that two and twenty
strong four-wheeled wagons would not be enough to
draw it from its place against the doorway. When
he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and
[245] goats, all in due course, and then let each
of them have her own young. He curdled half the
milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the
other half he poured into bowls that he might
drink it for his supper. [250] When he had got
through with all his work, he lit the fire, and
then caught sight of us, whereon he said:</p>
<p n="332" start-line="9.252" end-line="9.255">‘Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from?
Are you traders, or do you sail the sea as rovers,
[255] with your hands against every man, and every
man’s hand against you?’</p>
<p n="333" start-line="9.256" end-line="9.271">We were frightened out of our senses by his
loud voice and monstrous form, but I managed to
say, ‘We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,
but by the will of Zeus, [260] and stress of
weather, we have been driven far out of our
course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of
Atreus, who has won infinite <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign> throughout the
whole world, [265] by ransacking so great a city
and killing so many people. We therefore humbly
pray you to show us some hospitality, and
otherwise make us such presents as visitors may
reasonably expect. May your excellency revere
[give <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs </foreign>to]
the gods, for we are your suppliants, [270] and
Zeus takes all respectable travelers under his
protection, for he is the avenger of all
suppliants and foreigners in distress.’</p>
<p n="334" start-line="9.272" end-line="9.280">To this he gave me but a pitiless answer,
‘Stranger,’ said he, ‘you are a fool, or else you
know nothing of this country. Talk to me, indeed,
about fearing the gods or shunning their anger?
[275] We Cyclopes do not care about Zeus of the
aegis or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever
so much stronger than they. I shall not spare
either yourself or your companions out of any
regard for Zeus, unless I am in the humor for
doing so. And now tell me [280] where you made
your ship fast when you came on shore. Was it
round the point, or is she lying straight off the
land?’</p>
<p n="335" start-line="9.281" end-line="9.286">He said this to draw me out, but I was too
cunning to be caught in that way, so I answered
with a lie: ‘Poseidon, shaker of the Earth,’ said
I, ‘sent my ship on to the rocks at the far end of
your country, [285] and wrecked it. We were driven
on to them from the open sea, but I and those who
are with me escaped the jaws of death.’</p>
<p n="336" start-line="9.287" end-line="9.306">The cruel wretch granted me not one word of
answer, but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two
of my men at once and dashed them down upon the
ground as though they had been puppies. [290]
Their brains were shed upon the ground, and the
earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore them
limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled
them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh,
bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving
anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up
our hands to the sky on seeing [295] such a horrid
sight, for we did not know what else to do; but
when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and
had washed down his meal of human flesh with a
drink of neat milk, he stretched himself full
length upon the ground among his sheep, and went
to sleep. I was at first inclined [300] to seize
my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals,
but I reflected that if I did we should all
certainly be lost, for we should never be able to
shift [305] the stone which the monster had put in
front of the door. So we stayed sobbing and
sighing where we were till morning came.</p>
<p n="337" start-line="9.307" end-line="9.317">When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, he again lit his fire, milked his goats
and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let each
have her own young one; [310] as soon as he had
got through with all his work, he clutched up two
more of my men, and began eating them for his
morning’s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease,
he rolled the stone away from the door and drove
out his sheep, but he at once put it back again—as
easily as though he were merely clapping the lid
on to a quiver full of arrows. [315] As soon as he
had done so he shouted, and cried ‘Shoo, shoo,’
after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain;
so I was left to scheme some way of taking my
revenge and covering myself with glory.</p>
<p n="338" start-line="9.318" end-line="9.346">In the end I thought it would be the best plan
to do as follows. The Cyclops had a great club
which was lying near one of the sheep pens; [320]
it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it
intending to use it for a staff as soon as it
should be dry. It was so huge that we could only
compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant
vessel of large burden, and able to venture out
into open sea. [325] I went up to this club and
cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this
piece to the men and told them to fine it evenly
off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and
lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring
the end in the fire to make it harder. When I had
done this I hid it under dung, [330] which was
lying about all over the cave, and told the men to
cast lots which of them should venture along with
myself to lift it and bore it into the monster’s
eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the
very four whom I should have chosen, [335] and I
myself made five. In the evening the wretch came
back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into
the cave—this time driving them all inside, and
not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy
must have taken him, or a god must have prompted
him to do so. [340] As soon as he had put the
stone back to its place against the door, he sat
down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite
rightly, and then let each have her own young one;
when he had got through with all this work, he
gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper
off them. [345] So I went up to him with an
ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:</p>
<p n="339" start-line="9.347" end-line="9.352">‘Look here, Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you have been
eating a great deal of man’s flesh, so take this
and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of
liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it
to you as a drink-offering, in the hope that you
would take compassion upon me [350] and further me
on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on
ramping and raving most intolerably. You ought to
be ashamed yourself; how can you expect people to
come see you any more if you treat them in this
way?’</p>
<p n="340" start-line="9.353" end-line="9.359">He then took the cup and drank. He was so
delighted with the taste of the wine that he
begged me for another bowl full. [355] ‘Be so
kind,’ he said, ‘as to give me some more, and tell
me your name at once. I want to make you a present
that you will be glad to have. We have wine even
in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the
sun ripens them, but this drinks like nectar and
ambrosia all in one.’</p>
<p n="341" start-line="9.360" end-line="9.367">[360] I then gave him some more; three times
did I fill the bowl for him, and three times did
he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I
saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to
him as plausibly as I could: ‘Cyclops, you ask my
name and I will tell it you; [365] give me,
therefore, the present you promised me; my name is
Noman [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ou tis</foreign>];
this is what my father and mother and my friends
have always called me.’</p>
<p n="342" start-line="9.368" end-line="9.370">But the cruel wretch said, ‘Then I will eat all
Noman’s [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ou
tis</foreign>] comrades before Noman [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ou tis</foreign>] himself, [370]
and will keep Noman [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ou
tis</foreign>] for the last. This is the present
that I will make him.’</p>
<p n="343" start-line="9.371" end-line="9.402">As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face
upwards on the ground. His great neck hung heavily
backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him.
Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine
and the gobbets of human flesh on which he had
been gorging, for he was very drunk. [375] Then I
thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to
heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them
should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green
though it was, was about to blaze, [380] I drew it
out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men
gathered round me, for a superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] had
filled their hearts with courage. We drove the
sharp end of the beam into the monster’s eye, and
bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning
it round and round as though I were boring a hole
in a ship’s plank with an auger, [385] which two
men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as
long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red
hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood
bubbled all over it as we worked it round and
round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball
scalded his eyelids [390] and eyebrows, and the
roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a
blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold
water to temper it—for it is this that gives
strength to the iron—and it makes a great hiss as
he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss
round the beam of olive wood, [395] and his
hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran
away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all
besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it
from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as
he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived [400] on
the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered
from all quarters round his cave when they heard
him crying, and asked what was the matter with
him.</p>
<p n="344" start-line="9.403" end-line="9.406">‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that
you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of
the night, and preventing us from being able to
sleep? [405] Surely no man [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mē tis</foreign>] is carrying off
your sheep? Surely no man [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mē tis</foreign>] is trying to
kill you either by fraud or by force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>]?</p>
<p n="345" start-line="9.407" end-line="9.408">But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the
cave, ‘Noman [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ou
tis</foreign>] is killing me by fraud! Noman
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ou tis</foreign>] is
killing me by force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>]!’</p>
<p n="346" start-line="9.409" end-line="9.412">‘Then,’ said they, [410] ‘if no man [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mē tis</foreign>] is attacking
you, you must be ill; when Zeus makes people ill,
there is no help for it, and you had better pray
to your father Poseidon.’</p>
<p n="347" start-line="9.413" end-line="9.419">Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at
the success of my clever stratagem [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign>], [415] but the
Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt
about with his hands till he found the stone and
took it from the door; then he sat in the doorway
and stretched his hands in front of it to catch
anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I
might be foolish enough to attempt this.</p>
<p n="348" start-line="9.420" end-line="9.436">[420] As for myself I kept on puzzling to think
how I could best save my own life [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] and those of my
companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who
knows that his life depends upon it, for the
danger was very great. In the end I thought that
this plan would be the best. [425] The male sheep
were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece,
so I bound them noiselessly in threes together,
with some of the reeds on which the wicked monster
used to sleep. There was to be a man under the
middle sheep, [430] and the two on either side
were to cover him, so that there were three sheep
to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer
than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by
the back, ensconced myself in the thick wool under
his belly, [435] and hung on patiently to his
fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it
all the time.</p>
<p n="349" start-line="9.437" end-line="9.446">Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind
till morning came, but when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep
hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained
bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for
their udders [440] were full to bursting; but
their master in spite of all his pain felt the
backs of all the sheep as they stood upright,
without being sharp enough to find out that the
men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was
going out, last of all, [445] heavy with its
fleece and with the weight of my crafty self;
powerful Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:</p>
<p n="350" start-line="9.447" end-line="9.460">‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the
last to leave my cave this morning? You are not
wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the
mob with a run whether [450] to flowery mead or
bubbling fountain, and are the first to come home
again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it
because you know your master has lost his eye, and
are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid
crew have got him down in his drink and blinded
him? [455] But I will have his life yet. If you
could understand and talk, you would tell me where
the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his brains
upon the ground till they flew all over the cave.
[460] I should thus have some satisfaction for the
harm this no-good Noman has done me.’</p>
<p n="351" start-line="9.461" end-line="9.472">As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when
we were a little way out from the cave and yards,
I first got from under the ram’s belly, and then
freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were
very fat, by constantly heading them in the right
direction [465] we managed to drive them down to
the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing
those of us who had escaped death, but wept for
the others whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I
made signs to them by nodding and frowning that
they were to hush their crying, and told them to
get all [470] the sheep on board at once and put
out to sea; so they went aboard, took their
places, and smote the gray sea with their oars.
Then, when I had got as far out as my voice would
reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.</p>
<p n="352" start-line="9.473" end-line="9.479">[475] ‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken
better measure of your man before eating up his
comrades in your cave. You wretch, do you intend
by violence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>] to eat up your visitors in your
own cave? You might have known that your sin would
find you out, and now Zeus and the other gods have
punished you.’</p>
<p n="353" start-line="9.480" end-line="9.491">[480] He got more and more furious as he heard
me, so he tore the top from off a high mountain,
and flung it just in front of my ship so that it
was within a little of hitting the end of the
rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it,
and the wash [485] of the wave it raised carried
us back towards the mainland, and forced us
towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole
and kept the ship off, making signs to my men by
nodding my head, [490] that they must row for
their lives, whereon they laid out with a will.
When we had got twice as far as we were before, I
was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men
begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.</p>
<p n="354" start-line="9.492" end-line="9.499">‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to
provoke this savage creature further; [495] he has
thrown one rock at us already which drove us back
again to the mainland, and we were sure it had
been the death of us; if he had then heard any
further sound of voices he would have pounded our
heads and our ship’s timbers into a jelly with the
rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he
can throw them a long way.’</p>
<p n="355" start-line="9.500" end-line="9.505">[500] But I would not listen to them, and
shouted out to him in my rage, ‘Cyclops, if anyone
asks you who it was that put your eye out and
spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant
warrior Odysseus, ransacker of cities, [505] son
of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’</p>
<p n="356" start-line="9.506" end-line="9.521">Then he groaned, and cried out, ‘Alas, alas,
then the old prophecy about me is coming true.
There was a prophet [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mantis</foreign>] here, at one time, a man both
brave and of great stature, Telemos, son of
Eurymos, who was an excellent seer, [510] and did
all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew
old; he told me that all this would happen to me
some day, and said I should lose my sight by the
hand of Odysseus. I have been all along expecting
some one of imposing presence and superhuman
strength, [515] whereas he turns out to be a
little insignificant weakling, who has managed to
blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my
drink; come here, then, Odysseus, that I may make
you presents to show my hospitality, and urge
Poseidon, glorious shaker of the Earth, to help
you forward on your journey—for Poseidon and I are
father and son. [520] He, if he so will, shall
heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can
do.’</p>
<p n="357" start-line="9.522" end-line="9.525">Then I said, ‘I wish I could be as sure of
killing you outright and sending you down, bereft
of your <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>,
to the house of Hādēs, as I am [525] that it will
take more than Poseidon to cure that eye of
yours.’ Then he lifted up his hands to the
firmament of the sky and prayed, saying, ‘Hear me,
great Poseidon, who encircles the Earth; if I am
indeed your own true-begotten son, [530] grant
that Odysseus, ransacker of cities, son of
Laertes, who makes his home in Ithaca may never
reach his home alive; or if he must get back to
his friends at last, let him do so late and in
sore plight after losing all his men let him reach
his home [535] in another man’s ship and find
trouble in his house.’</p>
<p n="358" start-line="9.526" end-line="9.542">Thus did he pray, and Poseidon heard his
prayer. Then he picked up a rock much larger than
the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with
prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship,
[540] but was within a little of hitting the end
of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell
into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove
us onwards on our way towards the shore of the
island.</p>
<p n="359" start-line="9.543" end-line="9.555">When at last we got to the island where we had
left the rest of our ships, we found our comrades
[545] lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our
return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got
out of her on to the sea shore; we also landed the
Cyclops’ sheep, and divided them equitably amongst
us so that none might have reason to complain.
[550] As for the ram, my companions agreed that I
should have it as an extra share; so I sacrificed
it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to
Zeus, dark-clouded son of Kronos, who is the lord
of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only
thought how he might destroy [555] my ships and my
comrades.</p>
<p n="360" start-line="9.556" end-line="9.566">Thus through the livelong day to the going down
of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink,
but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we
camped upon the beach. [560] When the child of
morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my
men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they took
their places and smote the gray sea with their
oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts,
but glad to have escaped death though we had lost
our comrades.</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 10</head>
<p n="361" start-line="10.1" end-line="10.13" rend="no-indent">Thence we went on to the
Aeolian island where lives Aiolos, son of
Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an
island that floats (as it were) upon the sea, iron
bound with a wall that girds it. [5] Now, Aiolos
has six daughters and six sons in the bloom of
youth, so he made the sons marry the daughters,
and they all live with their dear father and
mother, feasting and enjoying every conceivable
kind of luxury. [10] All day long the atmosphere
of the house is loaded with the savor of roasting
meats till it groans again, yard and all; but by
night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads,
each with his own wife between the blankets. These
were the people among whom we had now come.</p>
<p n="362" start-line="10.14" end-line="10.27">Aiolos entertained me for a whole month asking
me questions all the time [15] about Troy, the
Argive fleet, and the return [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of the Achaeans.
I told him exactly how everything had happened,
and when I said I must go, and asked him to
further me on my way, he made no sort of
difficulty, but set about doing so at once.
Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide [20] to
hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut
up in the hide as in a sack—for Zeus, son of
Kronos, had made him captain over the winds, and
he could stir or still each one of them according
to his own pleasure. He put the sack in the ship
and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver
thread that not even a breath [25] of a side-wind
could blow from any quarter. The West wind, which
was fair for us, did he alone let blow as it
chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were
lost through our own folly.</p>
<p n="363" start-line="10.28" end-line="10.45">Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on
the tenth day our native land showed on the
horizon. [30] We got so close in that we could see
the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead
tired, fell into a light sleep, for I had never
let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might
get home the faster. Then the men fell to talking
among themselves, [35] and said I was bringing
back gold and silver in the sack that
great-hearted Aiolos, son of Hippotas, had given
me. ‘Bless my heart,’ would one turn to his
neighbor, saying, ‘how this man gets honored and
makes friends in whatever city or country he may
go. [40] See what fine prizes he is taking home
from Troy, while we, who have traveled just as far
as he has, come back with hands as empty as we set
out with— and now Aiolos has given him ever so
much more. Quick—let us see what it all is, [45]
and how much gold and silver there is in the sack
he gave him.’</p>
<p n="364" start-line="10.46" end-line="10.55">Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed.
They loosed the sack, whereupon the wind flew
howling forth and raised a storm that carried us
weeping out to sea and away from our own country.
Then I awoke, [50] and knew not whether to throw
myself into the sea or to live on and make the
best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and
lay down in the ship, while the men lamented
bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet [55]
back to the Aeolian island.</p>
<p n="365" start-line="10.56" end-line="10.66">When we reached it we went ashore to take in
water, and dined hard by the ships. Immediately
after dinner I took a herald and one of my men
[60] and went straight to the famous house of
Aiolos, where I found him feasting with his wife
and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the
threshold. They were astounded when they saw us
and said, ‘Odysseus, what brings you here? What
superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] has been ill-treating you? [65]
We took great pains to further you on your way
home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted
to go to.’</p>
<p n="366" start-line="10.67" end-line="10.76">Thus did they speak, but I answered
sorrowfully, ‘My men have undone me; they, and
cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me
this mischief, for you can if you will.’ [70] I
spoke as movingly as I could, but they said
nothing, till their father answered, ‘Vilest of
humankind, get you gone at once out of the island;
him whom the gods hate will I in no way help. [75]
Be off, for you come here as one abhorred of the
gods.’ And with these words he sent me sorrowing
from his door.</p>
<p n="367" start-line="10.77" end-line="10.86">Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were
worn out with long and fruitless rowing, for there
was no longer any wind to help them. [80] Six
days, night and day did we toil, and on the
seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold of
Lamos—Telepylos, the city of the Laestrygonians,
where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and
goats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving
out his flock [to feed] and this last answers the
salute. In that country a man who could do without
sleep might earn [85] double wages, one as a
herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd, for
they work much the same by night as they do by
day.</p>
<p n="368" start-line="10.87" end-line="10.102">When we reached the harbor we found it
land-locked under steep cliffs, [90] with a narrow
entrance between two headlands. My captains took
all their ships inside, and made them fast close
to one another, for there was never so much as a
breath of wind inside, but it was always dead
calm. [95] I kept my own ship outside, and moored
it to a rock at the very end of the point; then I
climbed a high rock to reconnoiter, but could see
no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke
rising from the ground. [100] So I sent two of my
company with an attendant to find out what sort of
people the inhabitants were.</p>
<p n="369" start-line="10.103" end-line="10.113">The men when they got on shore followed a level
road by which the people draw their firewood from
the mountains into the town, [105] till presently
they met a young woman who had come outside to
fetch water, and who was daughter to a
Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going to
the sweet-running fountain Artakia from which the
people bring in their water, and when my men had
come close up to her, they asked her [110] who the
king of that country might be, and over what kind
of people he ruled; so she directed them to her
father’s house, but when they got there they found
his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,
and they were horrified at the sight of her.</p>
<p n="370" start-line="10.114" end-line="10.132">She at once called her husband, famous
Antiphates, [115] from the place of assembly, and
right away he set about killing my men. He
snatched up one of them, and began to make his
dinner of him then and there, whereon the other
two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they
could. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry after
them, [120] and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians
sprang up from every quarter—ogres, not men. They
threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though
they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid
sound of the ships crunching up against one
another, and the death cries of my men, as the
Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took
them home to eat them. [125] While they were thus
killing my men within the harbor I drew my sword,
cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to
row with all their might if they too would not
fare like the rest; [130] so they laid out for
their lives, and we were thankful enough when we
got into open water out of reach of the rocks they
hurled at us. As for the others there was not one
of them left.</p>
<p n="371" start-line="10.133" end-line="10.155">Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped
death, though we had lost our comrades, [135] and
came to the Aeaean island, where Circe of the
lovely hair lives, a great and cunning goddess who
is own sister to the magician Aietes—for they are
both children of the sun, Helios who shines on
mortals, by Perse, who is daughter to Okeanos.
[140] We brought our ship into a safe harbor
without a word, for some god guided us there, and
having landed we stayed there for two days and two
nights, worn out in body and mind. When the
fair-haired morning of the third day came [145] I
took my spear and my sword, and went away from the
ship to reconnoiter, and see if I could discover
signs of human handiwork, or hear the sound of
voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I
espied the smoke of Circe’s house [150] rising
upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I
saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke,
I would not go on at once and find out more, but
in the end I thought it best to go back to the
ship, give [155] the men their dinners, and send
some of them instead of going myself.</p>
<p n="372" start-line="10.156" end-line="10.182">When I had nearly got back to the ship some god
took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine
antlered stag right into the middle of my path. He
was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink
of the river, [160] for the heat of the sun drove
him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle
of the back; the bronze point of the spear went
clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust
until the life went out of him. Then I set my foot
upon him, drew my spear from [165] the wound, and
laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and
rushes and twisted them into a fathom or so of
good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet
of the noble creature together; having so done I
hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship
[170] leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much
too big for me to be able to carry him on my
shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw
him down in front of the ship, I called the men
and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them.
‘Look here my friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going
to die so much before our time after all, [175]
and at any rate we will not starve so long as we
have got something to eat and drink on board.’
Then they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore
[180] and admired the stag, for he was indeed a
splendid specimen. Then, when they had feasted
their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed
their hands and began to cook him for dinner.</p>
<p n="373" start-line="10.183" end-line="10.197">Thus through the livelong day to the going down
of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our
fill, [185] but when the sun went down and it came
on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the
child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I
called a council and said, [190] My friends, I am
speaking this way because I do not know which
place is west and which place is east <seg
rend="subscript">191</seg> —which is the place
where the sun, bringing light for mortals, goes
underneath the earth <seg rend="subscript"
>192</seg> and which is the place where it rises.
Still, let us start thinking it through, as
quickly as we can, <seg rend="subscript"
>193</seg> whether there is still any craft
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign>] left. I
must tell you, though, I think there is none. We
are certainly on an island, for I went as high as
I could this morning, [195] and saw the sea
reaching all round it to the horizon; it lies low,
but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out
of a thick forest of trees.’</p>
<p n="374" start-line="10.198" end-line="10.209"><seg rend="subscript">198</seg> So I spoke. And
their heart was broken <seg rend="subscript"
>199</seg> as they remembered the deeds of
Antiphates the Laestrygonian [200] and
the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign> of the
great-hearted Cyclops, the man eater. <seg
rend="subscript">201</seg> And they wept loud and
shrill, letting many a tear fall. <seg
rend="subscript">202</seg> But crying did not get
them anywhere. So I divided my strong-greaved men
into two companies and set a captain over each;
[205] I gave one company to godlike Eurylokhos,
while I took command of the other myself. Then we
cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon
great-hearted Eurylokhos; so he set out with his
twenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who
were left behind.</p>
<p n="375" start-line="10.210" end-line="10.228">[210] When they reached Circe’s house they
found it built of cut stones, on a site that could
be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.
There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling
all round it—poor bewitched creatures whom she had
tamed by her enchantments and drugged into
subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged
their great tails, [215] fawned upon them, and
rubbed their noses lovingly against them. As
hounds crowd round their master when they see him
coming from dinner—for they know he will bring
them something—even so did these wolves and lions
with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the
men were terribly frightened at seeing such
strange creatures. [220] Presently they reached
the gates of the goddess’ house, and as they stood
there they could hear Circe within, singing most
beautifully as she worked at her loom, making a
web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colors
as no one but a goddess could weave. Then Polites,
leader of men, [225] whom I valued and trusted
more than any other of my men, said, ‘There is
some one inside working at a loom and singing most
beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let
us call her and see whether she is woman or
goddess.’</p>
<p n="376" start-line="10.229" end-line="10.240">They called her [230] and she came down,
unfastened the door, and bade them enter. They,
thinking no evil, followed her, all except
Eurylokhos, who suspected mischief and stayed
outside. When she had got them into her house, she
set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a
drink with cheese, honey, meal, [235] and Pramnian
wine but she drugged it with wicked poisons to
make them forget their homes, and when they had
drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her
wand, and shut them up in her pigsties. They were
like pigs—head, hair, and all, [240] and they
grunted just as pigs do; but their senses
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] were the
same as before, and they remembered
everything.</p>
<p n="377" start-line="10.241" end-line="10.250">Thus then were they shut up squealing, and
Circe threw them some acorns and beech masts such
as pigs eat, but Eurylokhos hurried back [245] to
tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was
so overcome with dismay that though he tried to
speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes
filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh,
till at last we forced his story out of him, [250]
and he told us what had happened to the
others.</p>
<p n="378" start-line="10.251" end-line="10.260">‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through
the forest, and in the middle of it there was a
fine house built with cut stones in a place that
could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or
else she was a goddess, working at her loom and
singing sweetly; [255] so the men shouted to her
and called her, whereon she at once came down,
opened the door, and invited us in. The others did
not suspect any mischief so they followed her into
the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought
there might be some treachery. From that moment I
saw them no more, [260] for not one of them ever
came out, though I sat a long time watching for
them.’</p>
<p n="379" start-line="10.261" end-line="10.269">Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it
over my shoulders; I also took my bow, and told
Eurylokhos to come back with me and show me the
way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands
[265] and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Sir, do not
force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for
I know you will not bring one of them back with
you, nor even return alive yourself; let us rather
see if we cannot escape at any rate with the few
that are left us, for we may still save our
lives.’</p>
<p n="380" start-line="10.270" end-line="10.288">[270] ‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I,
‘eating and drinking at the ship, but I must go,
for I am most urgently bound to do so.’ With this
I left the ship and went up inland. [275] When I
got through the charmed grove, and was near the
great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Hermes
with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in
the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down
just coming upon his face. [280] He came up to me
and took my hand within his own, saying, ‘My poor
unhappy man, where are you going over this
mountain top, alone and without knowing the way?
Your men are shut up in Circe’s pigsties, like so
many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not
fancy that you can set them free? I can tell you
[285] that you will never get back and will have
to stay there with the rest of them. But never
mind, I will protect you and get you out of your
difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of great
virtue, and keep it about you when you go to
Circe’s house, it will be a talisman to you
against every kind of mischief.</p>
<p n="381" start-line="10.289" end-line="10.301">And I will tell you of all the wicked
witchcraft that Circe will try to practice upon
you. [290] She will mix a potion for you to drink,
and she will drug the meal with which she makes
it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the
virtue of the herb that I shall give you will
prevent her spells from working. I will tell you
all about it. When Circe strikes you with her
wand, draw your sword [295] and spring upon her as
though you were going to kill her. She will then
be frightened and will desire you to go to bed
with her; on this you must not point blank refuse
her, for you want her to set your companions free,
and to take good care also of yourself, but you
make her swear solemnly by all the blessed that
she [300] will plot no further mischief against
you, or else when she has got you naked she will
unman you and make you fit for nothing.’</p>
<p n="382" start-line="10.302" end-line="10.306">As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the
ground and showed me what it was like. The root
was black, while the flower was as white as milk;
[305] the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot
uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they
like.</p>
<p n="383" start-line="10.307" end-line="10.320">Then Hermes went back to high Olympus passing
over the wooded island; but I fared onward to the
house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care
as I walked along. [310] When I got to the gates I
stood there and called the goddess, and as soon as
she heard me she came down, opened the door, and
asked me to come in; so I followed her—much
troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly
decorated seat [315] inlaid with silver, there was
a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed a
mixture in a golden goblet for me to drink; but
she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When
she had given it me, and I had drunk it without
its charming me, she struck me with her wand.
[320] ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be off to the
pigsty, and make your lair with the rest of
them.’</p>
<p n="384" start-line="10.321" end-line="10.335">But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as
though I would kill her, whereon she fell with a
loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke
piteously, saying, [325] ‘Who and whence are you?
From what place and people have you come? How can
it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?
Never yet was any man able to stand so much as a
taste of the herb I gave you; you must have some
sort of spell-proof <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>. [330] You must be Odysseus of
many turns [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>polutropos</foreign>], about whose <seg
rend="subscript">331</seg> future coming he used
to talk to me always—the one with the golden rod,
the Argeiphontes [= Hermes] — who he always said
would come here some day with his ship while on
his way home from Troy; so be it then; sheathe
your sword and let us go to bed, [335] that we may
make friends and learn to trust each other.’</p>
<p n="385" start-line="10.336" end-line="10.344">And I answered, ‘Circe, how can you expect me
to be friendly with you when you have just been
turning all my men into pigs? And now that you
have got me here myself, you mean me mischief
[340] when you ask me to go to bed with you, and
will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall
certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless
you will first take your solemn oath to plot no
further harm against me.’</p>
<p n="386" start-line="10.345" end-line="10.347">[345] So she swore at once as I had told her,
and when she had completed her oath then I went to
bed with her.</p>
<p n="387" start-line="10.348" end-line="10.374">Meanwhile her four servants, who are her
housemaids, set about their work. [350] They are
the children of the groves and fountains, and of
the holy waters that run down into the sea. One of
them spread a fair purple cloth over a seat, and
laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought
tables of silver up to the seats, [355] and set
them with baskets of gold. A third mixed some
sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put
golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth
brought in water and set it to boil in a large
cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted.
[360] When the water in the cauldron was boiling,
she poured cold into it till it was just as I
liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began
washing me from the cauldron about the head and
shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of
my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me and
anointing me with oil, [365] she arrayed me in a
good cloak and khiton and led me to a richly
decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a
footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then
brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and
poured it into a silver basin [370] for me to wash
my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an
upper servant brought me bread and offered me many
things of what there was in the house, and then
Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat
without heeding what was before me, still moody
and suspicious.</p>
<p n="388" start-line="10.375" end-line="10.381">[375] When Circe saw me sitting there without
eating, and in great grief [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>], she came to me
and said, ‘Odysseus, why do you sit like that as
though you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart,
and refusing both meat and drink? Is it [380] that
you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for
I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt
you.’</p>
<p n="389" start-line="10.382" end-line="10.387">And I said, ‘Circe, no man with any sense of
what is right can think of either eating or
drinking in your house [385] until you have set
his friends free and let him see them. If you want
me to eat and drink, you must free my men and
bring them to me that I may see them with my own
eyes.’</p>
<p n="390" start-line="10.388" end-line="10.405">When I had said this she went straight through
the court with her wand in her hand and opened the
pigsty doors. [390] My men came out like so many
prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went
about among them and anointed each with a second
drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug had
given them fell off, [395] and they became men
again, younger than they were before, and much
taller and better looking. They knew me at once,
seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for
joy till the whole house was filled with the sound
of their shouting, [400] and Circe herself was so
sorry for them that she came up to me and said,
‘Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of Laertes, go
back at once to the sea where you have left your
ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide
all your ship’s gear and property in some cave,
[405] and come back here with your men.’</p>
<p n="391" start-line="10.406" end-line="10.421">I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea
shore, and found the men at the ship weeping and
wailing most piteously. [410] When they saw me the
inept blubbering characters began frisking round
me as calves break out and gambol round their
mothers, when they see them coming home to be
milked after they have been feeding all day, and
the homestead resounds with their lowing. [415]
They seemed as glad to see me as though they had
got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they
had been born and bred. ‘Sir,’ said the
affectionate creatures, ‘we are as glad to see you
back [420] as though we had got safe home to
Ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of our
comrades.’</p>
<p n="392" start-line="10.422" end-line="10.437">I spoke comfortingly to them and said, ‘We must
draw our ship on to the land, and hide the ship’s
gear with all our property in some cave; [425]
then come with me all of you as fast as you can to
Circe’s house, where you will find your comrades
eating and drinking in the midst of great
abundance.’ Then the men would have come with me
at once, but Eurylokhos tried to hold them back
[430] and said, ‘Alas, poor wretches that we are,
what will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by
going to the house of Circe, who will turn us all
into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to
keep guard over her house. [435] Remember how the
Cyclops treated us when our comrades went inside
his cave, and bold Odysseus with them. It was all
through his sheer folly that those men lost their
lives.’</p>
<p n="393" start-line="10.438" end-line="10.445">When I heard him I was in two minds whether or
no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy
thigh [440] and cut his head off in spite of his
being a near relation of my own; but the men
interceded for him and said, ‘Sir, if it may so
be, let this man stay here and mind [445] the
ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe’s
house.’</p>
<p n="394" start-line="10.446" end-line="10.448">Then we all went inland, and Eurylokhos was not
left behind after all, but came on too, for he was
frightened by the severe reprimand that I had
given him.</p>
<p n="395" start-line="10.449" end-line="10.465">Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men
who had been left behind [450] were washed and
anointed with olive oil; she had also given them
woolen cloaks and khitons, and when we came we
found them all comfortably at dinner in her house.
As soon as the men saw each other face to face and
knew one another, they wept for joy and cried
aloud till the whole place rang again. [455] Then
Circe came up to me and said, ‘Resourceful
Odysseus, noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus,
tell your men to leave off crying; I know <seg
rend="subscript">458</seg> how much suffering you
underwent in the fishy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ikhthuoeis</foreign>] sea [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pοntos</foreign>], and how ill you
have fared among cruel savages on the mainland,
[460] but that is over now, so stay here, and eat
and drink till you are once more as strong and
hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at
present you are weakened both in body and mind;
you keep all the time thinking of the hardships
you have suffered during your travels, so that you
have no more [465] cheerfulness left in you.’</p>
<p n="396" start-line="10.466" end-line="10.474">Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed
with Circe for a whole twelvemonth feasting upon
an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But when
the year had passed, [470] and the seasons
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrai</foreign>] had
turned round, and the waning of moons and the long
days had begun, my men called me apart and said,
‘Sir, it is time you began to think about going
home, if so be it you are to be spared to see your
house and native country at all.’</p>
<p n="397" start-line="10.475" end-line="10.486">[475] Thus did they speak and I assented. Then
through the livelong day to the going down of the
sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when
the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid
themselves down to sleep in the covered halls.
[480] I, however, after I had got into bed with
Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess
listened to what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’ said
I, ‘please keep the promise you made me about
furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get
back [485] and so do my men, they are always
pestering me with their complaints as soon as ever
your back is turned.’</p>
<p n="398" start-line="10.487" end-line="10.495">And the goddess answered, ‘Resourceful
Odysseus, noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus,
you shall none of you stay here any longer if you
do not want to, [490] but first you [= Odysseus]
must bring to fulfillment [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">teleîn</foreign>] another journey
and travel until you enter <seg rend="subscript"
>491</seg>the palace of Hādēs and of the dreaded
Peresephone, <seg rend="subscript">492</seg> and
there you all will consult [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">khrē-</foreign>] the spirit
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of
Teiresias of Thebes, <seg rend="subscript"
>493</seg> the blind seer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>], whose thinking
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phrenes</foreign>] is
grounded [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>empedoi</foreign>]: <seg rend="subscript"
>494</seg> to him, even though he was dead,
Persephone gave consciousness [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], [495] so as to be
the only one there who has the power to think
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pepnusthai</foreign>].
But the others [in Hādēs] just flit about, like
shadows [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>skiai</foreign>].’</p>
<p n="399" start-line="10.496" end-line="10.502">I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in
bed and wept, and would gladly have lived no
longer to see the light of the sun, but presently
when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself
about, [500] I said, ‘And who shall guide me upon
this voyage—for the house of Hādēs is a port that
no ship can reach.’</p>
<p n="400" start-line="10.503" end-line="10.515">[505] ‘You will want no guide,’ she answered;
‘raise your mast, set your white sails, sit quite
still, and the North Wind will blow you there of
itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of
Okeanos, you will reach the fertile shore of
Persephone’s country [510] with its groves of tall
poplars and willows that shed their fruit
untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of
deep-eddying Okeanos, and go straight on to the
dark abode of Hādēs. You will find it near the
place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus
(which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into
Acheron, and you will see [515] a rock near it,
just where the two roaring rivers run into one
another.</p>
<p n="401" start-line="10.516" end-line="10.525">When you have reached this spot, as I now tell
you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length,
breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a
drink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed
with milk, then wine, [520] and in the third place
water—sprinkling white barley meal over the whole.
Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor
feeble spirits, and promise them that when you get
back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer
to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre
with good things. More particularly you must
promise that Teiresias shall have a black [525]
sheep all to himself, the finest in all your
flocks.</p>
<p n="402" start-line="10.526" end-line="10.540">When you shall have thus besought the spirits
with your prayers, offer them a ram and a black
ewe, bending their heads towards Erebos; but
yourself turn away from them as though you would
make towards the river. Then, [530] many dead
men’s spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhai</foreign>] will come to you, and you must
tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have
just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice
with prayers to Hādēs the powerful and to revered
Persephone. [535] Then draw your sword and sit
there, so as to prevent any other poor spirit
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] from
coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall
have answered your questions. The seer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] will presently
come to you, and will tell you about your
voyage—what stages you are to make, [540] and how
you are to sail the sea so as to reach your
homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>].’</p>
<p n="403" start-line="10.541" end-line="10.550">It was day-break by the time she had done
speaking, so she dressed me in my khiton and
cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light
gossamer fabric over her shoulders, [545]
fastening it with a golden waistband round her
waist, and she covered her head with a mantle.
Then I went about among the men everywhere all
over the house, and spoke kindly to each of them
man by man: ‘You must not lie sleeping here any
longer,’ said I to them, ‘we must be going, for
Lady Circe has told me all about it.’ [550] And
this they did as I bade them.</p>
<p n="404" start-line="10.551" end-line="10.560">Even so, however, I did not get them away
without misadventure. We had with us a certain
youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense
or courage, who had got drunk [555] and was lying
on the house-top away from the rest of the men, to
sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard
the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up
on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by
the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the
roof [560] and broke his neck, and his spirit
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] went
down to the house of Hādēs.</p>
<p n="405" start-line="10.561" end-line="10.565">When I had got the men together I said to them,
‘You think you are about to start home again, but
Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we
have got to go to the house of Hādēs and revered
Persephone [565] to consult the spirit of the
Theban prophet Teiresias.’</p>
<p n="406" start-line="10.566" end-line="10.574">The men were broken-hearted as they heard me,
and threw themselves on the ground groaning and
tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters
by crying. When we reached the sea shore, [570]
weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe brought the
ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the
ship. She passed through the midst of us without
our knowing it, for who can see the comings and
goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be
seen?</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 11</head>
<p n="407" start-line="11.1" end-line="11.22" rend="no-indent">Then, when we had got down to
the sea shore we drew our ship into the water and
got her mast and sails into her; we also put the
sheep on board and [5] took our places, weeping
and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great
and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew
dead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our
sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever
wanted doing to the ship’s gear [10] and let her
go as the wind and helmsman [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>] headed her.
All day long her sails were full as she held her
course over the sea, but when the sun went down
and darkness was over all the earth, we got into
the deep waters of the river Okeanos, where lie
the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] and city of the Cimmerians [15]
who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the
rays of the radiant sun never pierce neither at
his rising nor as he goes down again out of the
sky, but the poor wretches live in one long
melancholy night. [20] When we got there we
beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and
went along by the waters of Okeanos till we came
to the place of which Circe had told us.</p>
<p n="408" start-line="11.23" end-line="11.50">Here Perimedes and Eurylokhos held the victims,
while I drew my sword [25] and dug the trench a
cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the
dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine,
and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled white
barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to
the poor feckless spirits, and promising [30] them
that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a
barren heifer for them, the best I had, and would
load the pyre with good things. I also
particularly promised that Teiresias should have a
black sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks.
When I had prayed sufficiently [35] to the dead, I
cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood
run into the trench, whereon the spirits [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhai</foreign>] came trooping
up from Erebos—brides, young bachelors, old men
worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in
love, [40] and brave men who had been killed in
battle, with their armor still smirched with
blood; they came from every quarter and flitted
round the trench with a strange kind of screaming
sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw
them coming I told the men to be quick and flay
[45] the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make
burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to
repeat prayers to Hādēs and to revered Persephone;
but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and
would not let the poor feckless [50] spirits come
near the blood till Teiresias should have answered
my questions.</p>
<p n="409" start-line="11.51" end-line="11.58">The first spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē</foreign>] that came was that of my
comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet been laid
beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked
and unburied in Circe’s house, for other labor
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] was
pressing us. [55] I was very sorry for him, and
cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how did
you come down here into this gloom and darkness?
You have come here on foot quicker than I have
with my ship.’</p>
<p n="410" start-line="11.59" end-line="11.80">[60] ‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was
all bad luck of a superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>], and my own
unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the
top of Circe’s house, and never thought of coming
down again by the great staircase, but fell right
off the roof [65] and broke my neck, so my spirit
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] went
down to the house of Hādēs. And now I beseech you
by all those whom you have left behind you, though
they are not here, by your wife, by the father who
brought you up when you were a child, and by
Telemachus who is the one hope of your house, do
what I shall now ask you. I know that when you
leave this place [70] you will again hold your
ship for the Aeaean island. Do not go thence
leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I
may bring the gods’ anger upon you; but burn me
with whatever armor I have, [75] heap up a tomb
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] for me
at the shore of the gray sea, <seg
rend="subscript">76</seg> wretched man that I am,
so that even those who live in the future will
learn about it. <seg rend="subscript"
>77</seg> Make this ritual act [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">teleîn</foreign>] for me, and
stick the oar on top of the tomb [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">tumbos</foreign>] <seg
rend="subscript">78</seg> —the oar that I used
when I was rowing with my comrades [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hetairoi</foreign>].’ And I said,
[80] ‘My poor man, I will do all that you have
asked of me.’</p>
<p n="411" start-line="11.81" end-line="11.89">Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with
one another, I on the one side of the trench with
my sword held over the blood, and the spirit of my
comrade saying all this to me from the other side.
Then came the spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē</foreign>] of my dead mother [85]
Antikleia, daughter to great-hearted Autolykos. I
had left her alive when I set out for sacred Troy
and was moved to tears when I saw her, but even
so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come
near the blood till I had asked my questions of
Teiresias.</p>
<p n="412" start-line="11.90" end-line="11.96">[90] Then came also the spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of Theban
Teiresias, <seg rend="subscript">91</seg> with a
golden scepter in his hand. He recognized me and
said, <seg rend="subscript">92</seg> ‘Odysseus,
you who are descended from the gods, noble son of
Laertes, <seg rend="subscript">93</seg> why,
wretched man, have you left the light of day <seg
rend="subscript">94</seg> and come down to see the
dead in this place without any delights? [95]
Stand back from the trench and draw back your
sharp sword <seg rend="subscript">96</seg> so that
I may drink of the blood and tell you unmistakably
true things.’</p>
<p n="413" start-line="11.97" end-line="11.99"><seg rend="subscript">97</seg> So he spoke, and
I [= Odysseus] drew back, and sheathed my
silver-studded sword, <seg rend="subscript"
>98</seg>putting it back into the scabbard, and
then he [= Teiresias], after he had drunk the
black blood, <seg rend="subscript">99</seg> began
to address me with his words, faultless seer
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] that
he was:</p>
<p n="414" start-line="11.100" end-line="11.117">[100] ‘It’s your homecoming [<foreign

god will make this painful for you. I say that
because I do not think <seg rend="subscript"
>102</seg> that the earth-shaking god [= Poseidon]
will not take notice, who has lodged in his heart
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] an

<p n="415" start-line="11.118" end-line="11.137"><seg rend="subscript">118</seg> But you will
avenge the outrages committed by those men when

after you kill the suitors in your own house,
[120] killing them either by trickery or openly,
by way of sharp bronze, <seg rend="subscript"

with you a well-made oar, <seg rend="subscript"

which are painted purple on each side, [125] and
well-made oars that are like wings for ships. <seg

sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>], a
very clear one, which will not get lost in your

someone on the road encounters you <seg

be a winnowing shovel that you have on your

>129</seg> at that point you must stick into the
ground the well-made oar [130] and sacrifice
beautiful sacrifices to Lord Poseidon <seg

boar that mounts sows. <seg rend="subscript"
>132</seg> And then go home and offer sacred

to them in proper order, one after the other. As
for yourself, death shall come to you from the

<p n="416" start-line="11.138" end-line="11.144">‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please
the gods, [140] but tell me and tell me true, I

>psūkhē</foreign>] of Teiresias went back to the
house of Hādēs, for his prophecies had now been
spoken, but I sat still where I was until my
mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew
me at once and spoke fondly to me, saying, [155]
‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of
darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard
thing for the living to see these places, for
between us and them there are great and terrifying
waters, and there is Okeanos, which no man can
cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to
take him. Are you [160] all this time trying to
find your way home from Troy, and have you never
yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your
own house?’</p>
<p n="419" start-line="11.163" end-line="11.179">‘Mother,’ said I, [165] ‘I was forced to come
here to consult the spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of the Theban
prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the
Achaean land nor set foot on my native country,
and I have had nothing but one long series of
misfortunes from the very first day that I set out
with Agamemnon for Ilion, the land of noble
steeds, to fight the Trojans. [170] But tell me,
and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you
have a long illness, or did Artemis, shooter of
arrows, approach and slay you with her gentle
shafts? Tell me also about my father, and the son
whom I left behind me; is [175] my property still
in their hands, or has some one else got hold of
it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim
it? Tell me again what my wife intends doing, and
in what mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] she is; does she live with my son
and guard my estate securely, <seg
rend="subscript">179</seg> or has whoever is the
best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aristos</foreign>]
of the Achaeans already married her?</p>
<p n="420" start-line="11.180" end-line="11.203">[180] My mother answered, ‘Your wife still
remains in your house, but she is in great
distress of mind and spends her whole time in
tears both night and day. No one as yet has got
possession of your fine property, and [185]
Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He
has to entertain largely, as of course he must,
considering his position as a magistrate, and how
every one invites him; your father remains at his
old place in the country and never goes near the
town. He has no comfortable bed nor bedding; [190]
in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of
the fire with the men and goes about all in rags,
but in summer, when the warm weather comes on
again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of
vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground, feeling
grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>].
[195] He is in continual sorrow [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] about your
never having a homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], and suffers
more and more as he grows older. As for my own end
it was this way: the gods did not take me swiftly
and painlessly in my own house, [200] nor was I
attacked by any illness such as those that
generally wear people out and kill them, but my
longing to know what you were doing and the force
of my affection for you—this it was that was the
death of me.’</p>
<p n="421" start-line="11.204" end-line="11.214">Then I tried to find some way [205] of
embracing my mother’s spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>]. Thrice I sprang
towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but
each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a
dream or phantom, and being touched to the quick I
said to her, [210] ‘Mother, why do you not stay
still when I would embrace you? If we could throw
our arms around one another we might find sad
comfort in the sharing of our grief [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] even in the house
of Hādēs; does proud Persephone want to lay a
still further load of grief upon me by mocking me
with a phantom only?’</p>
<p n="422" start-line="11.215" end-line="11.224">[215] ‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill-fated
of all humankind, it is not Persephone, daughter
of Zeus, that is beguiling you, but all people are
like this when they are dead. The sinews no longer
hold the flesh and bones together; [220] these
perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon
as life has left the body, and the spirit
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] flits
away as though it were a dream. Now, however, go
back to the light of day as soon as you can, and
note all these things that you may tell them to
your wife hereafter.’</p>
<p n="423" start-line="11.225" end-line="11.234">[225] Thus did we converse, and then proud
Persephone sent up the spirits of the wives and
daughters of all the most famous men. They
gathered in crowds about the blood, and I
considered how I might question them severally.
[230] In the end I thought that it would be best
to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy
thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood
at once. So they came up one after the other, and
each one as I questioned her told me her birth and
lineage.</p>
<p n="424" start-line="11.235" end-line="11.252">[235] The first I saw was gloriously descended
Tyro. She was daughter of stately Salmoneus and
wife of Kretheus, the son of Aiolos. She fell in
love with the river, godlike Enipeus, who is much
the most beautiful river in the whole world. [240]
Once when she was taking a walk by his side as
usual, Poseidon, disguised as her lover, lay with
her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue
wave arched itself like a mountain over them to
hide both woman and god, [245] whereon he loosed
her virgin waistband and laid her in a deep
slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed of
love, he took her hand in his own and said, ‘Tyro,
rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods
[250] are not fruitless, and you will have fine
twins about this time twelve months. Take great
care of them. I am the Earthshaker Poseidon, so
now go home, but hold your tongue and do not tell
anyone.’</p>
<p n="425" start-line="11.253" end-line="11.259">Then he dived under the sea, and she in due
course bore Pelias and Neleus, [255] who both of
them served Zeus with all their might. Pelias was
a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolkos, but
the other lived in sandy Pylos. The rest of her
children were by Kretheus, namely, Aison, Pheres,
and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and
charioteer.</p>
<p n="426" start-line="11.260" end-line="11.265">[260] Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to
Asopos, who could boast of having slept in the
arms of even Zeus himself, and who bore him two
sons, Amphion and Zethos. These founded
seven-gated Thebes with its seven gates, and built
a wall all round it; for strong though they were
they could not [265] hold Thebes of wide spaces
till they had walled it.</p>
<p n="427" start-line="11.266" end-line="11.270">Then I saw Alkmene, the wife of Amphitryon, who
also bore to Zeus indomitable Hēraklēs,
lion-hearted and bold of purpose; and Megara, who
was daughter to high-spirited King Creon, [270]
and married the terrifying son of Amphitryon.</p>
<p n="428" start-line="11.271" end-line="11.280">I also saw fair Epikaste, mother of King
Oedipus, whose terrible lot it was to marry her
own son without suspecting it in her mind
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]. He
married her after having killed his father, but
the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world;
[275] whereon he remained king of beloved Thebes,
in great grief for the spite the gods had borne
him; but Epikaste went to the house of the mighty
jailer Hādēs, having hanged herself for grief,
[280] and the avenging spirits haunted him as for
an outraged mother—to his ruing bitterly
thereafter.</p>
<p n="429" start-line="11.281" end-line="11.297">Then I saw Khloris, surpassingly lovely, whom
Neleus married for her beauty, having given
priceless presents for her. She was youngest
daughter to Amphion, son of Iasos and king of
Minyan Orkhomenos, [285] and was Queen in Pylos.
She bore Nestor, Khromios, and proud Periklymenos,
and she also bore that marvelously lovely woman
Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but
Neleus would only give her to him who should raid
the [290] cattle of Iphikles from the grazing
grounds of Phylake, and this was a hard task. The
only man who would undertake to raid them was a
certain excellent seer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>mantis</foreign>], but the will of the gods was
against him, for the rangers of the cattle caught
him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a
full year had passed [295] and the same season
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] came
round again, Iphikles set him at liberty, after he
had expounded all the oracles of the gods. Thus,
then, was the will of Zeus accomplished.</p>
<p n="430" start-line="11.298" end-line="11.304">And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndareus, who bore
him two famous sons, [300] Castor [Kastor],
breaker of horses, and Pollux [Polydeukes], the
mighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying under
the earth, though they are still alive, for by a
special dispensation of Zeus, they die and come to
life again, each one of them every other day
throughout all time, and they have the rank of
gods.</p>
<p n="431" start-line="11.305" end-line="11.320">[305] After her I saw Iphimedeia, wife of
Aloeus, who boasted the embrace of Poseidon. She
bore two sons Otos and far-famed Ephialtes, but
both were short lived. They were the finest
children that were ever born in this world, [310]
and the best looking, famous Orion only excepted;
for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high,
and measured nine cubits round the chest. They
threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus,
[315] and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of
Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of
Ossa, that they might scale the sky itself, and
they would have done it, too, if they had been
grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of
them, before they had got so much as a sign of
hair [320] upon their cheeks or chin.</p>
<p n="432" start-line="11.321" end-line="11.325">Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair
Ariadne, daughter of the malignant magician Minos,
whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to
Athens, but he did not enjoy her, for before he
could do so Artemis killed her [325] in the island
of Dia on account of what Dionysus had said
against her.</p>
<p n="433" start-line="11.326" end-line="11.332">I also saw Maira and Klymene and hateful
Eriphyle, who sold her own husband for gold. But
it would take me all night if I were to name every
single one of the wives and daughters of heroes
whom I saw, [330] and it is time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] for me to go to
bed, either on board ship with my crew, or here.
As for my escort, the gods and yourselves will see
to it.”</p>
<p n="434" start-line="11.333" end-line="11.334">Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them
enthralled and speechless throughout the covered
hall. [335] Then white-armed Arete said to
them:</p>
<p n="435" start-line="11.335" end-line="11.341">“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians?
Is he not tall and good looking, and is he not
clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you
share in the distinction. Do not be in a hurry to
send him away, nor be withholding [340] in the
presents you make to one who is in such great
need, for the gods have blessed all of you with
great abundance.”</p>
<p n="436" start-line="11.342" end-line="11.346">Then spoke the aged hero Ekheneus who was one
of the oldest men among them, “My friends,” said
he, “what our august queen has just said to us is
both reasonable [345] and to the purpose,
therefore be persuaded by it; but the decision
whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King
Alkinoos.”</p>
<p n="437" start-line="11.347" end-line="11.353">“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alkinoos,
“as surely as I still live and reign over the
oar-loving Phaeacians. [350] Our guest is indeed
very anxious to his homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], still we must
persuade him to remain with us until tomorrow, by
which time I shall be able to get together the
whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards his
escort it will be a matter for you all, and mine
above all others as the chief person in the
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="438" start-line="11.354" end-line="11.361">And resourceful Odysseus answered, [355] “Great
King Alkinoos, if you were to bid me to stay here
for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my
way, loaded with your noble gifts, I should obey
you gladly and it would redound greatly to my
advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my
own people, [360] and should thus be more
respected and beloved by all who see me when I get
back to Ithaca.”</p>
<p n="439" start-line="11.362" end-line="11.376">“Odysseus,” replied Alkinoos, “not one of us
who sees you has any idea that you are a charlatan
or a swindler. I know there are many people [365]
going about who tell such plausible stories that
it is very hard to see through them, but there is
a style about your language which assures me of
your good disposition. Moreover you have told the
story of your own misfortunes, and those of the
Argives, as though you were a practiced bard;
[370] but tell me, and tell me true, whether you
saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at
the same time with yourself, and perished
there. <seg rend="subscript">373</seg> This night
is very long—immeasurably so. It is not yet time
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] <seg
rend="subscript">374</seg> to sleep in the palace.
But go on telling me about your wondrous deeds.
[375] And I myself could hold out until the bright
dawn, if only <seg rend="subscript">376</seg> you
could bear to tell me, here in the palace, of your
sufferings.”</p>
<p n="440" start-line="11.377" end-line="11.384">“Great Alkinoos, pre-eminent among all people,”
answered resourceful Odysseus, “there is a time
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] for
making speeches, and a time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] for going to bed;
[380] nevertheless, since you so desire, I will
not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale
of those of my comrades who did not fall fighting
with the Trojans, but perished on their return
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>],
through the treachery of a wicked woman.</p>
<p n="441" start-line="11.385" end-line="11.403">[385] When chaste Persephone had dismissed the
female spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhai</foreign>] in all directions, the spirit
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of
Agamemnon, son of Atreus, came sadly up to me,
surrounded by those who had perished with him in
the house of Aegisthus. [390] As soon as he had
tasted the blood he knew me, and weeping bitterly
stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me;
but he had no strength nor substance any more,
[395] and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld
him. ‘How did you come by your death,’ said I,
‘most lordly King Agamemnon? Did Poseidon [400]
raise his winds and waves against you when you
were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of
you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting
or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in
defense of their wives and city?’</p>
<p n="442" start-line="11.404" end-line="11.434">‘Resourceful Odysseus,’ he answered, [405]
‘noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, I was not
lost at sea in any storm of Poseidon’s raising,
nor did my foes dispatch me upon the mainland, but
Aegisthus [410] and my wicked wife were the death
of me between them. He asked me to his house,
feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably
as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house,
while all around me my comrades were slain like
sheep or pigs [415] for the wedding breakfast, or
dinner-party, or gourmet feast of some great
nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed
either in a general engagement, or in single
combat, but you never saw anything so truly
pitiable as the way in which we fell in that hall,
with the mixing-bowl and the loaded [420] tables
lying all about, and the ground reeking with our
blood. I heard Priam’s daughter Kassandra scream
as treacherous Clytemnestra killed her close
beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the
sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill the
slut of a murderess, [425] but she slipped away
from me; she would not even close my lips nor my
eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in
this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman
when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was.
[430] Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I
was going to be welcomed home by my children and
my servants, but her abominable crime has brought
disgrace on herself and all women who shall come
after—even on the good ones.’</p>
<p n="443" start-line="11.435" end-line="11.439">[435] And I said, ‘In truth Zeus of the wide
brows has hated the house of Atreus from first to
last in the matter of their women’s counsels. See
how many of us fell for Helen’s sake, and now it
seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against
you too during your absence.’</p>
<p n="444" start-line="11.440" end-line="11.461">[440] ‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued
Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly even with your
own wife. Do not tell her all that you know
perfectly well yourself. Tell her a part only, and
keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that
your wife, Odysseus, is likely to murder you,
[445] for circumspect Penelope is a very admirable
woman, and has an excellent nature. We left her a
young bride with an infant at her breast when we
set out for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown
up to man’s estate, [450] in a happy [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">olbios</foreign>] way, and he and
his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace
one another as it is right they should do, whereas
my wicked wife did not even allow me the happiness
of looking upon my son, but killed me before I
could do so. Furthermore I say—and lay my saying
to your heart— [455] do not tell people when you
are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal a
march upon them, for after all this there is no
trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true,
can you give me any news of my son Orestes? Is he
in Orkhomenos, or at sandy Pylos, [460] or is he
at Sparta with Menelaos—for I presume that he is
still living.’</p>
<p n="445" start-line="11.462" end-line="11.464">And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do
not know whether your son is alive or dead, and it
is not right to talk when one does not know.’</p>
<p n="446" start-line="11.465" end-line="11.476">[465] As we two sat weeping and talking thus
sadly with one another the spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of Peleus’s son,
Achilles, came up to us with Patroklos, stately
Antilokhos, and Ajax, who was the finest and best
man [470] of all the Danaans after the
swift-footed son of Peleus. The <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē </foreign>of the fleet
descendant of Aiakos knew me and spoke piteously,
saying, ‘Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of
Laertes and seed of Zeus, what deed of daring will
you undertake next, [475] that you venture down to
the house of Hādēs among us inept dead, who are
but the spirits of them that can labor no
more?’</p>
<p n="447" start-line="11.477" end-line="11.486">And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost
champion of the Achaeans, I came to consult
Teiresias, and see if he could advise me [480]
about my return home to Ithaca, for I have never
yet been able to get near the Achaean land, nor to
set foot in my own country, but have been in
trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one
was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor
ever will be, for you were adored by all us
Argives as long as you were alive, [485] and now
that you are here you are a great prince among the
dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to heart
even if you are dead.’</p>
<p n="448" start-line="11.487" end-line="11.503">‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s
favor; [490] I would rather be a paid servant in a
poor man’s house and be above ground than king of
kings among the dead. But give me news about my
son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a great
warrior, or is this not so? Tell me also if you
have heard anything about my father stately
Peleus— [495] does he still rule among the
Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect
throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old
and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by his
side, in the light of day, with the same strength
that I had when [500] I killed the bravest of our
foes upon the plain of Troy—could I but be as I
then was and go even for a short time to my
father’s house, anyone who tried to do him
violence or supersede him would soon feel my
strength and invincible hands.’</p>
<p n="449" start-line="11.504" end-line="11.537">[505] ‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of
stately Peleus, but I can tell you the truth
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">alētheia</foreign>]
about your beloved son Neoptolemos, for I took him
in my own ship from Skyros with the strong-greaved
Achaeans. [510] In our councils of war at Troy he
was always first to speak, and his judgment was
unerring. Godlike Nestor and I were the only two
who could surpass him; and when it came to
fighting on the plain of Troy, he would never
remain with [515] the body of his men, but would
dash on far in front, foremost of them all in
valor. Many a man did he kill in battle—I cannot
name every single one of those whom he slew while
fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only
say how he killed that valiant hero [520]
Eurypylos, son of Telephos, who was the handsomest
man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of
the Keteioi fell around him by reason of a woman’s
bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the
Argives went inside the horse that Epeios had
made, and it was left to me to settle [525] when
we should either open the door of our ambuscade,
or close it, though all the other leaders and
chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes
and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him
turn pale [530] nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he
was all the time urging me to break out from the
horse—grasping the handle of his sword and his
bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the
foe. Yet when we had ransacked the city of Priam
he got his handsome share of the prize wealth and
[535] went on board (such is the fortune of war)
without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown
spear nor in close combat, for the rage of Arēs is
a matter of great chance.’</p>
<p n="450" start-line="11.538" end-line="11.540">When I had told him this, the spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of Achilles
strode off across a meadow full of asphodel, [540]
exulting over what I had said concerning the
prowess of his son.</p>
<p n="451" start-line="11.541" end-line="11.551">The spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhai</foreign>] of other dead men stood near
me and told me each his own melancholy tale; but
the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē </foreign>of
swift-footed Ajax, son of Telamon, alone held
aloof—still angry with me for having won [545] the
cause in our dispute about the armor of Achilles.
Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan
prisoners and Athena were the judges. Would that I
had never gained the day in such a contest
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], for
it cost the life of [550] Ajax, who was foremost
of all the Danaans after the stately son of
Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.</p>
<p n="452" start-line="11.552" end-line="11.562">When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said,
‘Ajax, son of stately Telamon, will you not forget
and forgive even in death, but must the judgment
about that hateful armor still rankle with you?
[555] It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such
a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned
you as much as we mourned Achilles, son of Peleus
himself, nor can anything be blamed [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>] except the spite
that Zeus bore against the Danaans, [560] for it
was this that made him counsel your
destruction—come here, therefore, bring your proud
spirit into subjection, and hear what I can tell
you.’</p>
<p n="453" start-line="11.563" end-line="11.567">He would not answer, but turned away to Erebos
and to the other spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhai</foreign>]; [565] nevertheless, I should
have made him talk to me in spite of his being so
angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only
that there were still others among the dead whom I
desired to see.</p>
<p n="454" start-line="11.568" end-line="11.571"><seg rend="subscript">568</seg> There I saw
Minos, radiant son of Zeus, <seg rend="subscript"
>569</seg> who was holding a golden scepter as he
dispensed justice among the dead. [570] He was
seated, while they [= the dead] asked the lord for
his judgments [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikai</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>571</seg> Some of them [= the dead] were seated,
and some were standing, throughout the house of
Hādēs, with its wide gates.</p>
<p n="455" start-line="11.572" end-line="11.575">After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of
asphodel driving the spirits of the wild beasts
that he had killed upon the mountains, [575] and
he had a great bronze club in his hand,
unbreakable for ever and ever.</p>
<p n="456" start-line="11.576" end-line="11.581">And I saw Tityos, glorious son of Gaia,
stretched upon the plain and covering some nine
acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of
him were digging their beaks into his liver, and
he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands,
but could not; [580] for he had violated Zeus’
honored mistress Leto as she was going through
Panopeus on her way to Pytho.</p>
<p n="457" start-line="11.582" end-line="11.592">I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who
stood in a lake that reached his chin; he was
dying to quench his thirst, but could never reach
the water, [585] for whenever the poor creature
stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so
that there was nothing but dry ground—parched by a
superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>]. There were tall trees,
moreover, that shed their fruit over his
head—pears, pomegranates, apples, [590] sweet figs
and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature
stretched out his hand to take some, the wind
tossed the branches back again to the clouds.</p>
<p n="458" start-line="11.593" end-line="11.600">And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising
his prodigious stone [595] with both his hands.
With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the
top of the hill, but always, just before he could
roll it over on to the other side, its weight
would be too much for him, and the pitiless stone
would come thundering down again on to the plain.
Then he would begin trying to push it up hill
again, and the sweat ran [600] off him and the
steam rose after him.</p>
<p n="459" start-line="11.601" end-line="11.626">After him I saw mighty Hēraklēs, but it was his
phantom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>eidōlon</foreign>] only, for he [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">autos</foreign>] is feasting ever
with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to
wife, who is daughter of Zeus and Hera of the
golden sandals. [605] The spirits were screaming
round him like scared birds flying in all
directions. He looked black as night with his bare
bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,
glaring around as though ever on the point of
taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous
golden [610] belt adorned in the most marvelous
fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with
gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle, and
death. The man who made that belt, do what he
might, would never be able to make another like
it. [615] Hēraklēs knew me at once when he saw me,
and spoke piteously, saying, ‘My poor resourceful
Odysseus, noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus,
are you too leading the same sorry kind of life
that I did when I was above ground? [620] I was
son of Kronian Zeus, but I went through an
infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to
one who was far beneath me—a lowly man who set me
all manner of labors [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthloi</foreign>]. He once sent me here to fetch
the hound of Hādēs—for he did not think he could
find any <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign> harder for me than this, [625]
but I got the hound out of Hādēs and brought him
to him, for Hermes and Athena helped me.’</p>
<p n="460" start-line="11.627" end-line="11.640">Then Hēraklēs went down again into the house of
Hādēs, but I stayed where I was in case some other
of the mighty dead [630] should come to me. And I
should have seen still other of them that are gone
before, whom I would like to have seen—Theseus and
Perithoös glorious children of the gods, but so
many thousands of spirits came round me and
uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic
stricken lest proud Persephone should send up
[635] from the house of Hādēs the head of that
terrifying monster Gorgon. Then I hastened back to
my ship and ordered my men to go on board at once
and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took
their places, whereon the ship went down the
stream of the river Okeanos. [640] We had to row
at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.</p>

the abode and the dancing places [<foreign

the sunrises of Helios, [5] we then drew our ship

where we went to sleep and waited till day should

<p n="462" start-line="12.8" end-line="12.15">Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered
Dawn, appeared, I sent some men to Circe’s house
[10] to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood
from a wood where the headland jutted out into the
sea, and after we had wept over him and lamented
him we performed his funeral rites. When his body
and armor had been burned to ashes, <seg
rend="subscript">14</seg> We heaped up a tomb
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tumbos</foreign>] for
him, and then, erecting as a column on top, [15]
we stuck his well-made oar into the very top of
the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>tumbos</foreign>].</p>
<p n="463" start-line="12.16" end-line="12.27">While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew
that we had got back from the house of Hādēs,
dressed herself and came to us as fast as she
could; and her maid servants came with her
bringing us bread, meat, and wine. [20] Then she
stood in the midst of us and said, <seg
rend="subscript">21</seg>‘Wretched men! You went
down to the House of Hādēs while you were still
alive. <seg rend="subscript">22</seg> You

then, stay here for the rest of the day, feast
your fill, [25] and go on with your voyage at
daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will
tell Odysseus about your course, and will explain
everything to him so as to prevent your suffering
from misadventure either by land or sea.’</p>
<p n="464" start-line="12.28" end-line="12.35">We agreed to do as she had said, [30] and
feasted through the livelong day to the going down
of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came
on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by
the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took me
by the hand and bade me be seated away from the
others, while she reclined by my side and asked me
all about our adventures.</p>
<p n="465" start-line="12.36" end-line="12.54">[35] ‘So far so good,’ said she, when I had
ended my story, ‘and now pay attention to what I
am about to tell you—the god himself, indeed, will
recall it to your recollection. First you will
come to the Sirens who enchant [40] all who come
near them. If anyone unwarily draws in too close
and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and
children will never welcome him home again, for
they sit in a green field and warble him to death
with the sweetness of their song. [45] There is a
great heap of dead men’s bones lying all around,
with the flesh still rotting off them. Therefore
pass these Sirens by, and stop your men’s ears
with wax that none of them may hear; but if you
like you can listen yourself, [50] for you may get
the men to bind you in the swift ship, hands and
feet, upright in the step of the mast, and have
the ends of the ropes fastened to the mast itself,
that you may have the pleasure of listening. If
you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they
must bind you faster.</p>
<p n="466" start-line="12.55" end-line="12.72">[55] When your crew have taken you past these
Sirens, I cannot give you coherent directions as
to which of two courses you are to take; I will
lay the two alternatives before you, and you must
consider them for yourself. On the one hand there
are some overhanging rocks against which [60] the
deep blue waves of dark-eyed Amphitrite beat with
terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks
the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no,
not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to
Father Zeus, but the sheer rock always carries off
one of them, [65] and Father Zeus has to send
another to make up their number; no ship that ever
yet came to these rocks has got away again, but
the waves and whirlwinds of fire are freighted
with wreckage and with the bodies of dead
men. <seg rend="subscript">69</seg>The only
seafaring ship that has ever yet sailed past that
[rock] was [70] the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>Argo</foreign>, which-is-on-the-minds-of
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">melousa</foreign>] all
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pāsi</foreign>], and
this was when it sailed away from Aietes, and she
too would have gone against these great rocks,
only that Hera piloted her past them for the love
she bore to Jason.</p>
<p n="467" start-line="12.73" end-line="12.100">Of these two rocks the one reaches the sky and
its peak is lost in a dark cloud. [75] This never
leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even
in summer and early autumn. No man though he had
twenty hands and twenty feet could get a foothold
on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as
smooth as though it had been polished. [80] In the
middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West
and turned towards Erebos; you must take your ship
this way, but the cave is so high up that not even
the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it.
[85] Inside it Scylla sits and yelps with a voice
that you might take to be that of a young hound,
but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no
one—not even a god—could face her without being
terror-struck. She has twelve misshapen feet, and
six [90] necks of the most prodigious length; and
at the end of each neck she has a frightful head
with three rows of teeth in each, all set very
close together, so that they would crunch anyone
to death in a moment, [95] and she sits deep
within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and
peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins
or dogfish or any larger monster that she can
catch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite
teems. No ship ever yet got past her without
losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads
at once, [100] and carries off a man in each
mouth.</p>
<p n="468" start-line="12.101" end-line="12.110">You will find the other rocks lie lower, but
they are so close together that there is not more
than a bowshot between them. A large fig tree in
full leaf grows upon it, and under it lies the
sucking whirlpool of shining Charybdis. [105]
Three times in the day does she vomit forth her
waters, and three times she sucks them down again;
see that you be not there when she is sucking, for
if you are, Poseidon the Earthshaker himself could
not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and
drive the ship by as fast as you can, [110] for
you had better lose six men than your whole
crew.’</p>
<p n="469" start-line="12.111" end-line="12.114">‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping deadly
Charybdis, and at the same time keeping Scylla off
when she is trying to harm my men?’</p>
<p n="470" start-line="12.115" end-line="12.126">[115] ‘You daring man,’ replied the goddess,
‘you are always wanting to fight somebody or
something and to undergo an ordeal [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>]; you will not let
yourself be beaten even by the immortals. For
Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,
extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. [120] There
is no help for it; your best chance will be to get
by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle
about her rock while you are putting on your
armor, she may catch you with a second cast of her
six heads, and snap up another half dozen of your
men; so drive your ship past her at full speed,
and roar out lustily to Krataiis, [125] who is
Scylla’s mother, bad luck to her; she will then
stop her from making a second raid upon you.</p>
<p n="471" start-line="12.127" end-line="12.141">You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and
here you will see many herds of cattle and flocks
of sheep belonging to the sun-god, Helios—seven
herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, [130]
with fifty head in each flock. They do not breed,
nor do they become fewer in number, and they are
tended by the goddesses with sweet hair,
Phaethousa and Lampetie, who are children of the
sun-god Hyperion by Neaira. Their mother when she
had borne them and had done suckling them [135]
sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was a
long way off, to live there and look after their
father’s flocks and herds. If you leave these
flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but getting
home [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>],
you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but
if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the
destruction both [140] of your ship and of your
comrades; and even though you may yourself escape,
you will return late, in bad plight, after losing
all your men.’</p>
<p n="472" start-line="12.142" end-line="12.152">Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold
began to show in the sky, whereon she returned
inland. I then went on board and told my men [145]
to loose the ship from her moorings; so they at
once got into her, took their places, and began to
smite the gray sea with their oars. Presently the
great and cunning goddess fair-haired Circe, who
talks with mortals, befriended us with a fair wind
that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us,
[150] keeping our sails well filled, so we did
whatever wanted doing to the ship’s gear, and let
her go as wind and helmsman [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>] headed
her.</p>
<p n="473" start-line="12.153" end-line="12.164">Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my
men, ‘My friends, it is not right that one or two
of us alone [155] should know the prophecies that
Circe, bright among goddesses, has made me, I will
therefore tell you about them, so that whether we
live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First
she said we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who
sit and sing most beautifully in a field of
flowers; but she said [160] I might hear them
myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take
me and bind me to the crosspiece half way up the
mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so
fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash
the rope’s ends to the mast itself. If I beg and
pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly
still.’</p>
<p n="474" start-line="12.165" end-line="12.183">[165] I had hardly finished telling everything
to the men before we reached the island of the two
Sirens, for the wind had been very favorable. Then
all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a
breath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, [170]
so the men furled the sails and stowed them; then
taking to their oars they whitened the water with
the foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I took a
large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my
sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong [175]
hands till it became soft, which it soon did
between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god
son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my
men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast
as I stood upright on the crosspiece; [180] but
they went on rowing themselves. When we had got
within earshot of the land, and the ship was going
at a good rate, the Sirens saw that we were
getting in shore and began with their singing.</p>

>191</seg> and we know everything on earth, that
nurturer of so many mortals—everything that
happens.’</p>
<p n="476" start-line="12.192" end-line="12.200">They sang these words most musically, and as I
longed to hear them further I made by frowning to
my men that they should set me free; but they
quickened their stroke, [195] and Eurylokhos and
Perimedes bound me with still stronger bonds till
we had got out of hearing of the Sirens’ voices.
Then my men took the wax from their ears [200] and
unbound me.</p>
<p n="477" start-line="12.201" end-line="12.207">Immediately after we had got past the island I
saw a great wave from which spray was rising, and
I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were so
frightened that they loosed hold of their oars,
for the whole sea resounded with the rushing of
the waters, but the ship stayed where it was,
[205] for the men had left off rowing. I went
round, therefore, and exhorted them man by man not
to lose heart.</p>
<p n="478" start-line="12.208" end-line="12.221">‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first
time that we have been in danger, and we are in
nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops
[210] shut us up in his cave by forceful violence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>];
nevertheless, my excellence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] and wise counsel
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] saved us
then, and we shall live to look back on all this
as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say,
[215] trust in Zeus and row on with might and
main. As for you, helmsman [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>], these are
your orders; attend to them, for the ship is in
your hands; turn her head away from these steaming
rapids and hug the rock, [220] or she will give
you the slip and be over yonder before you know
where you are, and you will be the death of
us.’</p>
<p n="479" start-line="12.222" end-line="12.233">So they did as I told them; but I said nothing
about the terrifying monster Scylla, for I knew
the men would not go on [225] rowing if I did, but
would huddle together in the hold. In one thing
only did I disobey Circe’s strict instructions—I
put on my armor. Then seizing two strong spears I
took my stand on the ship’s bows, [230] for it was
there that I expected first to see the monster of
the rock, who was to do my men so much harm; but I
could not make her out anywhere, though I strained
my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and
over.</p>
<p n="480" start-line="12.234" end-line="12.259">Then we entered the Straits in great fear of
mind, for on the one hand [235] was Scylla, and on
the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt
water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water
in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon a great
fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks
on either side. [240] When she began to suck
again, we could see the water all inside whirling
round and round, and it made a deafening sound as
it broke against the rocks. We could see the
bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and
mud, and the men were at their wit’s ends for
fear. While we were taken up with this, and were
expecting each moment to be our last, [245] Scylla
pounced down suddenly upon us and with violence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] snatched
up my six best men. I was looking at once after
both ship and men, and in a moment I saw their
hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling
in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I
heard them call out my name [250] in one last
despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in
hand, upon some jutting rock throws bait into the
water to deceive the poor little fishes, and
spears them with the ox’s horn with which his
spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the
land as he catches them one by one— [255] even so
did Scylla land these panting creatures on her
rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den,
while they screamed and stretched out their hands
to me in their mortal agony. This was the most
sickening sight that I saw throughout all my
voyages.</p>
<p n="481" start-line="12.260" end-line="12.276">[260] When we had passed the Wandering rocks,
with Scylla and terrifying Charybdis, we reached
the noble island of the sun-god, where were the
goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun
Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship [265] I
could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to
the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I
remembered what the blind Theban prophet [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] Teiresias had
told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned
me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god.
[270] So being much troubled I said to the men,
‘My men, I know you are hard pressed, but listen
while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made
me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to
shun the island of the blessed sun-god, [275] for
it was here, she said, that our worst danger would
lie. Head the ship, therefore, away from the
island.’</p>
<p n="482" start-line="12.277" end-line="12.293">The men were in despair at this, and Eurylokhos
at once gave me an insolent answer. ‘Odysseus,’
said he, ‘you are cruel; [280] you are very strong
yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be
made of iron, and now, though your men are
exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will
not let them land and cook themselves a good
supper upon this island, but bid them put out to
sea [285] and go faring fruitlessly on through the
watches of the fleeing night. It is by night that
the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how
can we escape should one of those sudden squalls
spring up from South West or West, which so often
[290] wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are
unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey the call
of night and prepare our supper here hard by the
ship; tomorrow morning we will go on board again
and put out to sea.’</p>
<p n="483" start-line="12.294" end-line="12.302">Thus spoke Eurylokhos, and the men approved his
words. [295] I saw that a superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] meant
us mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for
you are many against one, but at any rate each one
of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet
with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep,
[300] he will not be so mad as to kill a single
head of either, but will be satisfied with the
food that immortal Circe has given us.’</p>
<p n="484" start-line="12.303" end-line="12.311">They all swore as I bade them, and when they
had completed their oath [305] we made the ship
fast in a harbor that was near a stream of fresh
water, and the men went ashore and cooked their
suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and
drink, they began talking about their poor
comrades [310] whom Scylla had snatched up and
eaten; this set them weeping and they went on
crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.</p>
<p n="485" start-line="12.312" end-line="12.319">In the third watch of the night when the stars
had shifted their places, Zeus raised a great gale
of wind that flew a hurricane so that [315] land
and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night
sprang forth out of sky. When the child of
morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought
the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein
the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>], and I
called the men together in council.</p>
<p n="486" start-line="12.320" end-line="12.324">[320] ‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and
drink in the ship, let us mind, therefore, and not
touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for
these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun,
who sees and gives ear to everything.’ And again
they promised that they would obey.</p>
<p n="487" start-line="12.325" end-line="12.338">[325] For a whole month the wind blew steadily
from the South, and there was no other wind, but
only South and East. As long as wheat and wine
held out the men did not touch the cattle when
they were hungry; when, however, they had eaten
all there was in the ship, [330] they were forced
to go further afield, with hook and line, catching
birds, and taking whatever they could lay their
hands on; for they were starving. One day,
therefore, I went up inland that I might pray the
gods to show me some means of getting away. [335]
When I had gone far enough to be clear of all my
men, and had found a place that was well sheltered
from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all
the gods in Olympus till by and by they sent me
off into a sweet sleep.</p>
<p n="488" start-line="12.339" end-line="12.351">Meanwhile Eurylokhos had been giving evil
counsel to the men, [340] ‘Listen to me,’ said he,
‘my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but
there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we
drive in the best of these cows and offer them in
sacrifice to the immortal gods? [345] If we ever
get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to
the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of
ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink
our ship out of revenge for these horned cattle,
and the other gods are of the same mind, [350] I
for one would rather drink salt water once for all
and have done with it, than be starved to death by
inches in such a desert island as this is.’</p>
<p n="489" start-line="12.352" end-line="12.365">Thus spoke Eurylokhos, and the men approved his
words. Now the cattle, so fair and goodly, [355]
were feeding not far from the ship; the men,
therefore drove in the best of them, and they all
stood round them saying their prayers, and using
young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there
was no barley left. When they had done praying
they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses;
[360] they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped them
round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of
raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with
which to make drink-offerings over the sacrifice
while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a
little water from time to time while the innards
were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones
were burned and they had tasted the innards, [365]
they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon
the spits.</p>
<p n="490" start-line="12.366" end-line="12.373">By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I
turned back to the ship and to the sea shore. As I
drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, [370]
so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods.
‘Father Zeus,’ I exclaimed, ‘and all you other
gods who live in everlasting bliss, you have
inflicted on me a cruel aberration [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] by the sleep into
which you have sent me; see what fine work these
men of mine have been making in my absence.’</p>
<p n="491" start-line="12.374" end-line="12.383">Meanwhile Lampetie of the light robes went
straight off to the sun [375] and told him we had
been killing his cows, whereon he flew into a
great rage, and said to the immortals, ‘Father
Zeus, and all you other gods who live in
everlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the
crew of Laertes’ son Odysseus’ ship: they have had
the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one
thing I loved to [380] look upon, whether I was
going up the sky or down again. If they do not
square accounts with me about my cows, I will go
down to Hādēs and shine there among the dead.’</p>
<p n="492" start-line="12.384" end-line="12.388">[385] ‘Sun,’ said Zeus, ‘go on shining upon us
gods and upon humankind over the fruitful earth. I
will shiver their ship into little pieces with a
bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to
sea.’</p>
<p n="493" start-line="12.389" end-line="12.390">I was told all this by fair-haired Kalypsō,
[390] who said she had heard it from the mouth of
Hermes.</p>
<p n="494" start-line="12.391" end-line="12.396">As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea
shore I rebuked each one of the men separately,
but we could see no way out of it, for the cows
were dead already. And indeed the gods began at
once to show signs and wonders among us, [395] for
the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the
joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and
the meat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a
noise just as cows do.</p>
<p n="495" start-line="12.397" end-line="12.414">For six days my men kept driving in the best
cows and feasting upon them, but when Zeus, the
son of Kronos, had added a seventh [400] day, the
fury of the gale abated; we therefore went on
board, raised our masts, spread sail, and put out
to sea. As soon as we were well away from the
island, and could see nothing but sky and sea,
[405] the son of Kronos raised a black cloud over
our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did
not get on much further, for in another moment we
were caught by a terrific squall from the West
that snapped the forestays [410] of the mast so
that it fell aft, while all the ship’s gear
tumbled about at the bottom of the vessel. The
mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the
ship’s stern, so that the bones of his head were
crushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though
he were diving, with no more life left in him.</p>
<p n="496" start-line="12.415" end-line="12.419">[415] Then Zeus let fly with his thunderbolts,
and the ship went round and round, and was filled
with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck
it. The men all fell into the sea; they were
carried about in the water round the ship, looking
like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently
deprived them of all chance of any homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>].</p>
<p n="497" start-line="12.420" end-line="12.425">[420] I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked
her sides from her keel (which drifted about by
itself) and struck the mast out of her in the
direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of
stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and with
this I lashed the mast and keel together, [425]
and getting astride of them was carried wherever
the winds chose to take me.</p>
<p n="498" start-line="12.426" end-line="12.446">The gale from the West had now spent its force,
and the wind got into the South again, which
frightened me lest I should be taken back to the
terrifying whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was
what actually happened, for I was borne along by
the waves all night, and by sunrise [430] had
reached the rock of Scylla, and the dreaded
whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt sea
water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig
tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like
a bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to
stand securely, [435] for the roots were a long
way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole
pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart
for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on,
waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and
raft again—and a very long while it seemed. One
who judges [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>krinein</foreign>] is not more glad to get home
to supper, [440] after having been long detained
in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see
my raft beginning to work its way out of the
whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands
and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by
my raft on to which I then got, and began to row
with my hands. [445] As for Scylla, the father of
gods and men would not let her get further sight
of me—otherwise I should have certainly been
lost.</p>
<p n="499" start-line="12.447" end-line="12.453">Hence I was carried along for nine days till on
the tenth night the gods stranded me on the
Ogygian island, where dwells the great and
powerful fair-haired goddess Kalypsō. [450] She
took me in and was kind to me, but I need say no
more about this, for I told you and your noble
wife all about it yesterday, and it is hateful
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ekhthron</foreign>] to
me to say the same thing over and over again.”</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 13</head>
<p n="500" start-line="13.1" end-line="13.3" rend="no-indent">Thus did he speak, and they
all held their peace throughout the covered hall,
enthralled by the charm of his story, till
presently Alkinoos began to speak.</p>
<p n="501" start-line="13.4" end-line="13.15">“Odysseus,” said he, “now that you have reached
my bronze-founded house [5] I doubt not you will
get home without further misadventure no matter
how much you have suffered in the past. To you
others, however, who come here night after night
to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I
would insist as follows. [10] Our guest has
already packed up the clothes, wrought gold, and
other valuables which you have brought for his
acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him
further, each one of us, with a large tripod and a
cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of
a general rate [15] throughout the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]; for
private individuals cannot be expected to bear the
burden of such a handsome present.”</p>
<p n="502" start-line="13.16" end-line="13.37">Every one approved of this, and then they went
home to bed each in his own abode. When the child
of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they
hurried down to the ship and brought their
cauldrons with them. [20] Alkinoos, the hallowed
prince, went on board and saw everything so
securely stowed under the ship’s benches that
nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.
Then they went to the house of Alkinoos, the
hallowed prince, to get dinner. <seg
rend="subscript">24</seg> On their [= the
Phaeacians’] behalf Alkinoos, the one with the
holy power, sacrificed an ox [25] to Zeus, the one
who brings dark clouds, the son of Kronos, and he
rules over all. <seg rend="subscript"
>26</seg> Then, after burning the thigh-pieces,
they feasted, feasting most gloriously, <seg
rend="subscript">27</seg> and they were feeling
delight [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>terpesthai</foreign>]; in their midst
sang-and-danced [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>melpesthai</foreign>] the divine singer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aoidos</foreign>], <seg
rend="subscript">28</seg> Demodokos, honored by
the people. But Odysseus kept on turning his eyes
towards [30] the sun, as though to hasten his
setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As
one who has been all day plowing a fallow field
with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his
supper and is glad when night comes that he may go
and get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry
him, [35] even so did Odysseus rejoice when the
sun went down, and he at once said to the
oar-loving Phaeacians, addressing himself more
particularly to King Alkinoos, pre-eminent among
all others:</p>
<p n="503" start-line="13.38" end-line="13.46">“Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your
drink-offerings and send me on my way rejoicing,
[40] for you have fulfilled my heart’s desire by
giving me an escort, and making me presents, and
may the gods grant that I turn those things into
blessed [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbia</foreign>]
possessions; may I find my admirable wife living
in peace among friends, and may you whom I leave
behind me give satisfaction to your [45] wives and
children; may the gods grant you every kind of
good accomplishment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>], and may no evil thing come
among your people.”</p>
<p n="504" start-line="13.47" end-line="13.52">Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them
approved his saying and agreed that he should have
his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably.
Alkinoos therefore said to his servant, [50]
“Pontonoos, mix some wine and hand it round to
everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father
Zeus, and speed our guest upon his way.”</p>
<p n="505" start-line="13.53" end-line="13.57">Pontonoos mixed the wine and handed it to every
one in turn; the others each from his own seat
made a drink-offering [55] to the blessed gods
that live in the sky, but Odysseus rose and placed
the double cup in the hands of Queen Arete.</p>
<p n="506" start-line="13.58" end-line="13.62">“Farewell, Queen,” said he, “henceforward and
for ever, till age [60] and death, the common lot
of humankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take
my leave; be happy in this house with your
children, your people, and with King
Alkinoos.”</p>
<p n="507" start-line="13.63" end-line="13.80">As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and
Alkinoos sent a man [65] to conduct him to his
ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some
maid servants with him—one with a clean khiton and
cloak, another to carry his strong-box, and a
third with wheat and wine. [70] When they got to
the water side the crew took these things and put
them on board, with all the meat and drink; but
for Odysseus they spread a rug and a linen sheet
on deck that he might sleep [75] soundly in the
stern of the ship. Then he too went on board and
lay down without a word, but the crew took every
man his place in order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kosmos</foreign>] and loosed the hawser from the
pierced stone to which it had been bound. <seg
rend="subscript">78</seg> When they [= the
Phaeacian seafarers] began rowing out to sea, <seg
rend="subscript">79</seg> he [= Odysseus] felt a
sweet sleep falling upon his eyelids. [80] It was
a deep sleep, the sweetest, and most similar to
death.</p>
<p n="508" start-line="13.81" end-line="13.92"><seg rend="subscript">81</seg> Meanwhile, the
ship was speeding ahead, just as a team of four
stallions drawing a chariot over a plain <seg
rend="subscript">82</seg> speeds ahead in unison
as they all feel the stroke of the whip, <seg
rend="subscript">83</seg>galloping along smoothly,
with feet raised high as they make their way
forward, <seg rend="subscript">84</seg> so also
the prow of the ship kept curving upward as if it
were the neck of a stallion, and, behind the ship,
waves that were [85] huge and seething raged in
the waters of the roaring sea. <seg
rend="subscript">86</seg>The ship held steadily on
its course, and not even a falcon, <seg
rend="subscript">87</seg> raptor that he is,
swiftest of all winged creatures, could have kept
pace with it. <seg rend="subscript">88</seg> So
did the ship cut its way smoothly through the
waves, <seg rend="subscript">89</seg> carrying a
man who was like the gods in his knowledge of
clever ways, [90] who had beforehand suffered very
many pains [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>algea</foreign>] in his heart [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>], <seg
rend="subscript">91</seg>taking part in wars among
men and forging through so many waves that cause
pain, <seg rend="subscript">92</seg>but now he was
sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all he had
suffered.</p>
<p n="509" start-line="13.93" end-line="13.112"><seg rend="subscript">93</seg> And when the
brightest of all stars began to show, the one
that, more than any other star, comes to announce
the light of the Dawn born in her earliness [95]
that is when the ship, famed for its travels over
the seas, drew near to the island. Now there is in
the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of Ithaca a haven of Phorkys,
the Old One of the sea, which lies between two
points that break the line of the sea and shut the
harbor in. These shelter it from the storms of
wind and sea [100] that rage outside, so that,
when once within it, a ship may lie without being
even moored. At the head of this harbor there is a
large olive tree, and at no distance a fine
overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are
called [105] Nymphs of Wellsprings, Naiads. There
are mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone,
and the bees hive there. Moreover, there are great
looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their
robes of sea purple—very curious to see—and at all
times there is water within it. It has two
entrances, [110] one facing North by which mortals
can go down into the cave, while the other comes
from the South and is more mysterious; mortals
cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken
by the gods.</p>
<p n="510" start-line="13.113" end-line="13.125">Into this harbor, then, they took their ship,
for they knew the place. [115] She had so much way
upon her that she ran half her own length on to
the shore; when, however, they had landed, the
first thing they did was to lift Odysseus with his
rug and linen sheet out of the ship, and lay him
down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then [120]
they took out the presents which great-hearted
Athena had persuaded the haughty Phaeacians to
give him when he was setting out on his voyage
homewards. They put these all together by the root
of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear
some passer by might come and steal them before
Odysseus awoke; and then they made the best of
their way home again.</p>
<p n="511" start-line="13.125" end-line="13.138">[125] But Poseidon, the Earthshaker, did not
forget the threats with which he had already
threatened Odysseus, so he took counsel with Zeus.
“Father Zeus,” said he, “I shall no longer be held
in any sort of respect among you gods, [130] if
mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh
and blood, show such small regard for me. I said I
would get Odysseus home when he had suffered
sufficiently. I did not say that he should never
achieve a homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] at all, for I knew you had
already nodded your head about it, and promised
that he should do so; but now they have brought
him over the sea in a ship fast asleep [135] and
have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with
more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and
raiment than he would ever have brought back from
Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and got
home without misadventure.”</p>
<p n="512" start-line="13.139" end-line="13.145">And Zeus answered, [140] “What, O Lord of the
Earthquake, are you talking about? The gods are by
no means wanting in respect for you. It would be
monstrous were they to insult one so old and
honored as you are. As regards mortals, however,
if any of them is indulging in insolence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] and treating you
disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself
to deal with him as you may think proper, [145] do
as you wish and as was pleasing to your
heart.”</p>
<p n="513" start-line="13.146" end-line="13.152">“I should have done so at once,” replied
Poseidon, shaker of the Earth, “if I were not
anxious to avoid anything that might displease
you; <seg rend="subscript">149</seg> so now I want
to smash the very beautiful ship of the Phaeacians
[150] when it comes back, in a misty crossing of
the sea, from its conveying mission, <seg
rend="subscript">151</seg> so that these people [=
the Phaeacians] will hold off, at long last, and
stop their practice of conveying <seg
rend="subscript">152</seg> humans. And I want to
make a huge mountain envelop their city.”</p>
<p n="514" start-line="13.153" end-line="13.158">“My good friend,” answered Zeus, “I should
recommend you [155] at the very moment [155] when
all the people of the city look out and see the
ship sailing in, <seg rend="subscript"
>156</seg> turn it into a rock, just as it is
about to reach land. <seg rend="subscript"
>157</seg> Make it look like a swift ship, so that
people will look at it with wonder <seg
rend="subscript">158</seg> —all of humanity will
do so; and make the huge mountain envelop their
city.”</p>
<p n="515" start-line="13.159" end-line="13.169">When earth-encircling Poseidon heard this he
went [160] to Skheria where the Phaeacians live,
and stayed there till the ship, which was making
rapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to
it, turned it into stone, and drove it down with
the flat of his hand so as to root it in the
ground. After this he went away. [165] The
Phaeacians of the long oars then began talking
among themselves, and one would turn towards his
neighbor, saying, “Who is it that can have rooted
the ship in the sea just as she was getting into
port? We could see the whole of her only a moment
ago.”</p>
<p n="516" start-line="13.170" end-line="13.184">[170] This was how they talked, but they knew
nothing about it; and Alkinoos said, “I remember
now the old prophecy of my father. He said that
Poseidon would be angry with us for taking every
one so safely over the sea, [175] He once said
that he [Poseidon] will smash the very beautiful
ship of the Phaeacian men <seg rend="subscript"
>176</seg> when it comes back, in a misty crossing
of the sea, from its conveying mission, <seg
rend="subscript">177</seg> and that he will make a
huge mountain envelop our city. <seg
rend="subscript">178</seg>That is what the old man
said. And now you and I see that all these things
are being brought to fulfillment. <seg
rend="subscript">179</seg> But come, let us all
comply with exactly what I am about to say. [180]
In the first place we must leave off giving people
escorts when they come here, and in the next let
us sacrifice twelve picked [<foreign

Poseidon <seg rend="subscript">182</seg> in hopes
that he will take pity <seg rend="subscript"
>183</seg> and will not make the tall mountain
envelop our city.” When the people heard this they
were afraid and got ready the bulls.</p>
<p n="517" start-line="13.185" end-line="13.199">[185] Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of the Phaeacians pray to king
Poseidon, standing round his altar; and at the
same moment great Odysseus woke up, once more upon
his own soil. He had been so long away that he did
not know it again; moreover, Zeus’ daughter Athena
[190] had made it a foggy day, so that people
might not know of his having come, and that she
might tell him everything without either his wife
or his fellow townspeople and friends recognizing
him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked
suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite
different to him— [195] the long straight tracks,
the harbors, the precipices, and the goodly trees,
appeared all changed as he started up and looked
upon his native land. So he smote his thighs with
the flat of his hands and cried aloud
despairingly.</p>
<p n="518" start-line="13.200" end-line="13.216">[200] “Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner
of people am I fallen? Are they savage and
uncivilized [non-<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikaios</foreign>] or hospitable and endowed with
god-fearing mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>]? Where shall I put all this
treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had
stayed over there with the Phaeacians; [205] or I
could have gone to some other great chief who
would have been good to me and given me an escort.
As it is I do not know where to put my treasure,
and I cannot leave it here for fear somebody else
should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs
and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing
in a fair [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikaios</foreign>] way with me, [210] and have
left me in the wrong country; they said they would
take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so:
may Zeus the protector of suppliants chastise
them, for he watches over everybody and punishes
those who do wrong. [215] Still, I suppose I must
count my goods and see if the crew have gone off
with any of them.”</p>
<p n="519" start-line="13.217" end-line="13.226">He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons,
his gold and all his clothes, but there was
nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not
being in his own country, [220] and wandered up
and down by the shore of the sounding sea
bewailing his hard fate. Then Athena came up to
him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and
princely mien, with a good cloak folded double
about her shoulders; [225] she had sandals on her
comely feet and held a javelin in her hand.
Odysseus was glad when he saw her, and went
straight up to her.</p>
<p n="520" start-line="13.227" end-line="13.235">“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person
whom I have met with in this country; I salute
you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed
towards me in your thinking [<foreign

these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your
knees and pray to you as though you were a god.
Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and
country [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]
is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an
island, or is this the sea board [235] of some
continent?”</p>
<p n="521" start-line="13.236" end-line="13.249">Owl-vision Athena answered, “Stranger, you must
be very simple, or must have come from somewhere a
long way off, not to know what country this is. It
is a very celebrated place, [240] and everybody
knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a
good driving country, but it is by no means a bad
island for what there is of it. It grows any
quantity of wheat and also [245] wine, for it is
watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle
also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and
there are watering places where the water never
runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known
even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a
long way off from this Achaean country.”</p>
<p n="522" start-line="13.250" end-line="13.255">[250] Resourceful great Odysseus was glad at
finding himself, as Athena told him, in his own
country, and he began to answer, but he did not
speak the truth [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>alēthēs</foreign>], and made up a lying story
[255] in the instinctive wiliness of his mind
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>].</p>
<p n="523" start-line="13.256" end-line="13.286">“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in
Crete beyond the seas, and now it seems I have
reached it with all these treasures. I have left
as much more behind me for my children, but am
fleeing because I killed Orsilokhos, a man of
swift feet and son of Idomeneus, [260] the
fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him because he
wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy
with so much trouble and danger both on the field
of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; [265]
he said I had not served his father loyally in the
Trojan district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] as vassal, but had set myself up
as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait for him
and with one of my followers by the roadside, and
speared him as he was coming into town from the
country. It was a very dark night and nobody saw
us; it was not known, therefore, [270] that I had
killed him, but as soon as I had done so I went to
a ship and besought the owners, who were
Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in
Pylos [275] or in shining Elis where the Epeioi
rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.
They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off
their course, and we sailed on till we came here
by night. It was all we could do to get inside the
harbor, [280] and none of us said a word about
supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went
on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very
tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my
goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me
where I was lying upon the sand. [285] Then they
sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in
great distress of mind.”</p>
<p n="524" start-line="13.287" end-line="13.310">Such was his story, but owl-vision Athena
smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she
took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and high-
spirited. [290] “He must be indeed a shifty lying
character,” said she, “who could surpass you in
all manner of craft [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kerdos</foreign>] even though you had a god for
your antagonist. Daring that you are, full of
guile, unwearying in deceit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>], [295] can you not
drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood,
even now that you are in your own country again?
We will say no more, however, about this, for we
both of us know craftiness [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>] upon
occasion—you are the best counselor and orator
among all humankind, while I for diplomacy and
crafty ways [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kerdea</foreign>] have fame [<foreign

[300] Did you not know Zeus’ daughter Athena—me,
who have been ever with you, who kept watch over
you in all your ordeals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ponos</foreign>], and who made the Phaeacians
take so great a liking to you? And now, again, I
am come here to talk things over with you, and
help you to hide the treasure I made the haughty
Phaeacians [305] give you; I want to tell you
about the troubles that await you in your own
house; you have got to face them, but tell no one,
neither man nor woman, that you have come home
again. Bear everything, and put up with [310]
every man’s violent insolence [<foreign

word.”</p>
<p n="525" start-line="13.311" end-line="13.328">And resourceful Odysseus answered, “A man,
goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so
constantly changing your appearance that when he
meets you it is a hard matter for him to know
whether it is you or not. This much, however, I
know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me
[315] as long as we Achaeans were fighting at
Troy, but from the day on which we went on board
ship after having ransacked the city of Priam, and
the gods dispersed us—from that day, Athena, I saw
no more of you, and cannot ever remember your
coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty;
[320] I had to wander on sick and sorry till the
gods delivered me from evil and I reached the
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of the Phaeacians, where you
encouraged me and took me into the town. And now,
I beseech you in your father’s name, tell me the
truth, for I do not believe [325] I am really back
in Ithaca. I am in some other country and you are
mocking me and deceiving me in all you have been
saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back
to my own country?”</p>
<p n="526" start-line="13.329" end-line="13.351">[330] “You are always taking something of that
sort into your head,” replied owl-vision goddess
Athena, “and that is why I cannot desert you in
your afflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and
shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so
long a voyage would at once have gone home to see
his wife and children, but you do not [335] seem
to care about asking after them or hearing any
news about them till you have made trial of your
wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you,
and having no peace night or day for the tears she
sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near
you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was
certain [340] you would get back safely though you
would lose all your men, and I did not wish to
quarrel with my uncle Poseidon, who never forgave
you for having blinded his son. I will now,
however, point out to you the lie of the land, and
you will then perhaps believe me. [345] This is
the haven of the old merman Phorkys, and here is
the olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near
it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] here too is
the overarching cavern in which [350] you have
offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the Nymphs
of Wellsprings, Naiads, and this is the wooded
mountain Neriton.”</p>
<p n="527" start-line="13.352" end-line="13.360">As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and
the land appeared. Then long-suffering great
Odysseus rejoiced at finding himself again in his
own land, and kissed the bounteous soil; [355] he
lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs,
saying, “Naiad nymphs, daughters of Zeus, I was
sure that I was never again to see you, now
therefore I greet you with all loving salutations,
and I will bring you offerings as in the old days,
if Zeus’ terrifying daughter will grant me [360]
life, and bring my son to manhood.”</p>
<p n="528" start-line="13.361" end-line="13.365">“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about
that,” rejoined owl-vision Athena, “let us rather
set about stowing your things at once in the cave,
where they will be quite safe. [365] Let us see
how we can best manage it all.”</p>
<p n="529" start-line="13.366" end-line="13.373">Therewith she went down into the cave to look
for the safest hiding places, while Odysseus
brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and
good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him.
[370] They stowed everything carefully away, and
Athena set a stone against the door of the cave.
Then the two sat down by the root of the great
olive, and consulted how to compass the
destruction of the wicked suitors.</p>
<p n="530" start-line="13.374" end-line="13.381">[375] “Resourceful Odysseus,” said Athena,
“noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, think how
you can lay hands on these disreputable people who
have been lording it in your house these three
years, courting your godlike wife and making
wedding presents to her, while she does nothing
but mourning your <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>, [380] giving hope and sending
encouraging messages to every one of them, but
meaning [in her <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] the very opposite of all she
says.”</p>
<p n="531" start-line="13.382" end-line="13.391">And resourceful Odysseus answered, “In good
truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to
much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon
did, [385] if you had not given me such timely
information. Advise me how I shall best avenge
myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into
my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy’s fair
diadem from her brow. Help me now as you did then,
[390] and I will fight three hundred men, if you,
goddess, will be with me.”</p>
<p n="532" start-line="13.392" end-line="13.415">“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose
sight of you when once we set about it, and I
would imagine that some of those who are devouring
your substance will then [395] bespatter the
pavement with their blood and brains. I will begin
by disguising you so that no human being shall
know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles;
you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe
you [400] in a garment that shall fill all who see
it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for
you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight
of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom
you left behind you. Then go at once to the
swineherd [405] who is in charge of your pigs; he
has been always well affected towards you, and is
devoted to circumspect Penelope and your son; you
will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that
is called Raven by the fountain Arethousa, where
they are fattening on beechmast [410] and spring
water after their manner. Stay with him and find
out how things are going, while I proceed to
Sparta and see your son, who is with Menelaos at
Lacedaemon, the country of lovely women, [415]
where he has gone to try and find out [<foreign

still alive.”</p>
<p n="533" start-line="13.416" end-line="13.419">“But why,” said resourceful Odysseus, “did you
not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did you
want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of
hardship while others are eating up his
estate?”</p>
<p n="534" start-line="13.420" end-line="13.428">[420] Owl-vision Athena answered, “Never mind
about him, I sent him that he might be well spoken
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] of for
having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>], but is
staying quite comfortably with Menelaos, and is
surrounded with abundance of every kind. [425] The
suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait
for him, for they mean to kill him before he can
get home. I do not much think they will succeed,
but rather that some of those who are now eating
up your estate will first find a grave
themselves.”</p>
<p n="535" start-line="13.429" end-line="13.438">As she spoke Athena touched him with her wand
and covered him with wrinkles, took away all his
yellow hair, [430] and withered the flesh over his
whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were
naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes
and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a
khiton, [435] tattered, filthy, and begrimed with
smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as
an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff
and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong
for him to sling it over his shoulder.</p>
<p n="536" start-line="13.439" end-line="13.440">When the pair had thus laid their plans they
parted, and the goddess [440] went straight to

<head>Rhapsody 14</head>
<p n="537" start-line="14.1" end-line="14.28" rend="no-indent">Odysseus now left the haven,
and took the rough track up through the wooded
country and over the crest of the mountain till he
reached the place where Athena had said that he
would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty
servant he had. [5] He found him sitting in front
of his hut, which was by the yards that he had
built on a site which could be seen from far. He
had made them spacious and fair to see, with a
free run for the pigs all round them; he had built
them during his master’s absence, [10] of stones
which he had gathered out of the ground, without
saying anything to Penelope or old Laertes, and he
had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside
the yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts,
split, and set pretty close together, while inside
he had built twelve sties near one another for the
sows to lie in. [15] There were fifty pigs
wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding sows;
but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in
number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and
the swineherd had to send them the best he had
[20] continually. There were three hundred and
sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman’s four hounds,
which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with
them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out
a pair of sandals from a good stout ox-hide. [25]
Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one
place or another, and he had sent the fourth to
town with a boar that he had been forced to send
the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have
their fill of meat.</p>
<p n="538" start-line="14.29" end-line="14.47">When the hounds saw Odysseus [30] they set up a
furious barking and flew at him, but Odysseus was
cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of
the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would
have been torn by them in his own homestead had
not the swineherd dropped his ox-hide, rushed full
speed through the gate of the yard [35] and driven
the dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at
them. Then he said to Odysseus, “Old man, the dogs
were likely to have made short work of you, and
then you would have got me into trouble. The gods
have given me quite enough worries without that,
[40] for I have lost the best of masters, and am
in continual grief on his account. I have to
attend swine for other people to eat, while he, if
he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving
in some distant locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>]. [45] But come inside, and when
you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me
where you come from, and all about your
misfortunes.”</p>
<p n="539" start-line="14.48" end-line="14.54">Then the swineherd led the way into the hut and
bade him sit down. He strewed a good thick bed of
rushes [50] upon the floor, and on the top of this
he threw the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick
one—on which he used to sleep by night. Odysseus
was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said
“May Zeus, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you
your heart’s desire in return for the kind way in
which you have received me.”</p>
<p n="540" start-line="14.55" end-line="14.71">[55] To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios,
“Stranger, though a still poorer man should come
here, it would not be right for me to insult him,
for all strangers and beggars are from Zeus. You
must take what you can get and be thankful, for
servants [60] live in fear when they have young
lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune
now, for the gods have hindered the return
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of him
who would have been always good to me and given me
something of my own—a house, a piece of land, a
good looking wife, [65] and all else that a
liberal master allows a servant who has worked
hard for him, and whose labor the gods have
prospered as they have mine in the situation which
I hold. If my master had grown old here he would
have done great things by me, but he is gone, and
I wish that Helen’s whole lineage were utterly
destroyed, for she has been the death of many [70]
a good man. It was this matter that took my master
to Ilion, the land of noble steeds, to fight the
Trojans in the cause of King Agamemnon.”</p>
<p n="541" start-line="14.72" end-line="14.79">As he spoke he bound his belt round him and
went to the sties where the young sucking pigs
were penned. He picked out two which he brought
back with him and sacrificed. [75] He singed them,
cut them up, and spitted on them; when the meat
was cooked he brought it all in and set it before
Odysseus, hot and still on the spit, whereon
Odysseus sprinkled it over with white barley meal.
The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of
ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Odysseus told
him to begin.</p>
<p n="542" start-line="14.80" end-line="14.108">[80] “Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish
of servant’s pork. The fat pigs have to go to the
suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple;
but the blessed gods love not such shameful
doings, and respect those who do what is lawful
and right [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikē</foreign>]. [85] Even the fierce pirates who
go raiding on other people’s land, and Zeus gives
them their spoil—even they, when they have filled
their ships and got home again live
conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for
judgment; but some god seems to have told these
people [90] that Odysseus is dead and gone; they
will not, therefore, go back to their own homes
and make their offers of marriage in the proper
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>] way,
but waste his estate by force, without fear or
stint. Not a day or night comes out of the sky,
but they sacrifice not one victim nor [95] two
only, and they take the run of his wine, for he
was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in
Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he
had as much as twenty men put together. I will
tell you what he had. [100] There are twelve herds
of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks of
sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while
his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve
widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he
runs even large flocks of goats on the far end of
the island, and they are in the charge of
excellent goatherds. [105] Each one of these sends
the suitors the best goat in the flock every day.
As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you
see here, and I have to keep picking [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] out the best I
have and sending it to them.”</p>
<p n="543" start-line="14.109" end-line="14.147">This was his story, but Odysseus went on eating
and drinking [110] ravenously without a word,
brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and
was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from
which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and
gave it to Odysseus, who was pleased, and said as
he took it in his hands, [115] “My friend, who was
this master of yours that bought you and paid for
you, so rich and so powerful as you tell me? You
say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon;
tell me who he was, in case I may have met with
such a person. Zeus and the other gods know, [120]
but I may be able to give you news of him, for I
have traveled much.” Eumaios answered, “Old man,
no traveler who comes here with news will get
Odysseus’ wife and son to believe his story. <seg
rend="subscript">124</seg> It’s no use! Wanderers
in need of food [125] are liars [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pseudontai</foreign>], and they
are unwilling to tell true things [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alēthea mūthēsasthai</foreign>];
every one who finds his way to the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
Ithaca goes to my mistress and tells her
falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much
of them, and asks them all manner of questions,
crying all the time [130] as women will when they
have lost their husbands. And you too, old man,
for a khiton and a cloak would doubtless make up a
very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of
prey have long since torn Odysseus to pieces, and
his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē </foreign>left
him behind; [135] or the fish devoured him in the
sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>],
and his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon
some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad
business it is for all his friends—for me
especially; go where I may I shall never find so
good a master, [140] not even if I were to go home
to my mother and father where I was bred and born.
I do not so much care, however, about my parents
now, though I should dearly like to see them again
in my own country; it is the loss of Odysseus that
grieves me most; [145] I cannot speak of him
without reverence though he is here no longer, for
he was very fond of me, and took such care of me
that wherever he may be I shall always honor his
memory.”</p>
<p n="544" start-line="14.148" end-line="14.164">“My friend,” replied long-suffering great
Odysseus, “you are very positive, [150] and very
hard of belief about your master’s coming home
again, nevertheless I will not merely say, but
will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me
anything for my news till he has actually come,
you may then give me a khiton and cloak of good
wear if you will. [155] I am in great want, but I
will not take anything at all till then, for
hateful [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ekhthros</foreign>] as Hādēs to me is a man who
lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by
King Zeus, by the rites of hospitality, and by
that hearth of blameless Odysseus to which I have
now come, [160] that all will surely happen as I
have said it will. Odysseus will return in this
self same year; with the end of this moon and the
beginning of the next he will be here to do
vengeance on all those who are ill treating his
wife and son.”</p>
<p n="545" start-line="14.165" end-line="14.190">[165] To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, “Old man, you will neither get paid for
bringing good news, nor will Odysseus ever come
home; drink your wine in peace, and let us talk
about something else. Do not keep on reminding me
of all this; [170] it always pains me when any one
speaks about my honored master. As for your oath
we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come,
as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his
son, godlike Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too
about [175] this same boy of his; he was running
up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse
man, face and figure, than his father, but some
one, either god or man, has been unsettling his
mind, so he has gone off [180] to Pylos to try and
get news of his father, and the suitors are lying
in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope
of leaving the house of Arkeisios without a name
in Ithaca. But let us say no more about him, and
leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the
son of Kronos holds his hand over him to protect
him. [185] And now, old man, tell me your own
story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you
are and where you come from. Tell me of your town
and parents, what manner of ship you came in, what
crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country
they professed to come— [190] for you cannot have
come by land.”</p>
<p n="546" start-line="14.191" end-line="14.198">And resourceful Odysseus answered, “I will tell
you all about it. If there were meat and wine
enough, [195] and we could stay here in the hut
with nothing to do but to eat and drink while the
others go to their work, I could easily talk on
for a whole twelve months without ever finishing
the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased
the gods to visit me.</p>
<p n="547" start-line="14.199" end-line="14.233"><seg rend="subscript">199</seg> I say solemnly
that I was born and raised in Crete, the place
that reaches far and wide; [200] my father was a
well-to-do man, who had many sons born in
marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he
had purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my
father Castor, son of Hylax (whose lineage I
claim, [205] and who was held in the highest honor
in the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of the Cretans for his wealth,
prosperity [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbos</foreign>], and the valor of his sons) put
me on the same level with my brothers who had been
born in wedlock. When, however, death took him to
the house of Hādēs, his sons divided his estate
and cast lots for their shares, [210] but to me
they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless,
my excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>] enabled me to marry into a rich
family, for I was not given to bragging, or
shirking on the field of battle. It is all over
now; still, if you look at the straw you can see
[215] what the ear was, for I have had trouble
enough and to spare. Arēs and Athena made me
doughty in war; when I had picked [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] my men to
surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave
death so much as a thought, [220] but was the
first to leap forward and spear all whom I could
overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care
about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those
who would bring up children. My delight was in
ships, [225] fighting, javelins, and arrows—things
that most men shudder to think of; but one man
likes one thing and another, and this was what I
was most naturally inclined to. Before the
Achaeans went to Troy, [230] nine times was I in
command of men and ships on foreign service, and I
amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in
the first instance, and much more was allotted to
me later on.</p>
<p n="548" start-line="14.234" end-line="14.261">My house grew apace and I became a great man
among the Cretans, [235] but when Zeus counseled
that terrifying expedition, in which so many
perished, the people required me and renowned
Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there
was no way out of it, for the judgment of the
people of the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] insisted on our doing so. [240]
There we fought for nine whole years, but in the
tenth we ransacked the city of Priam and sailed
home again as the gods dispersed us. Then it was
that Zeus devised evil against me. I spent but one
month happily with my children, [245] wife, and
property, and then I conceived the idea of making
a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet
and manned it. I had nine ships, and the people
flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men
[250] made feast, and I found them many victims
both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves,
but on the seventh day we went on board and set
sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us
though we were going down a river. Nothing went
ill [255] with any of our ships, and we had no
sickness on board, but sat where we were and let
the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them.
On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus;
there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding
my men stay [260] by them and keep guard over them
while I sent out scouts to reconnoiter from every
point of vantage.</p>
<p n="549" start-line="14.262" end-line="14.284">But the men disobeyed with insolence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>] my orders, took
to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the
Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives
and children captive. [265] The alarm was soon
carried to the city, and when they heard the war
cry, the people came out at daybreak till the
plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers
and with the gleam of armor. Then Zeus spread
panic among my men, [270] and they would no longer
face the enemy, for they found themselves
surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and
took the rest alive to do forced labor for them.
Zeus, however, put it in my mind to do thus—and I
wish I had died then and [275] there in Egypt
instead, for there was much sorrow in store for
me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my
spear from my hand; then I went straight up to the
king’s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them,
whereon he spared my life, [280] bade me get into
his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home.
Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried
to kill me in their fury, but the king protected
me, for he feared the anger [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] of Zeus the
protector of strangers, who punishes those who do
evil.</p>
<p n="550" start-line="14.285" end-line="14.298">[285] I stayed there for seven years and got
together much wealth among the Egyptians, for they
all gave me something; but when it was now going
on for eight years there came a certain
Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already
committed all sorts of villainy, [290] and this
man talked me over into going with him to
Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions
lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but
at the end of that time when months and days had
gone by till the same season [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] had come round
again, [295] he set me on board a ship bound for
Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo
along with him to that place, but really that he
might sell me as a slave and take the wealth I
fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on
board with him, for I could not help it.</p>
<p n="551" start-line="14.299" end-line="14.320">The ship ran before a fresh North wind [300]
till we had reached the sea that lies between
Crete and Libya; there, however, Zeus counseled
their destruction, for as soon as we were well out
from Crete and could see nothing but sea and sky,
he raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea
grew dark beneath it. [305] Then Zeus let fly with
his thunderbolts and the ship went round and round
and was filled with fire and brimstone as the
lightning struck it. The men fell all into the
sea; they were carried about in the water round
the ship looking like so many sea-gulls, but the
god presently deprived them of all chance of
homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>]. [310] I was all dismayed;
Zeus, however, sent the ship’s mast within my
reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and
drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did
I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night
[315] a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian
coast. There Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians,
entertained me hospitably without charging me
anything at all, for his son found me when I was
nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he
raised me by the hand, took me to his father’s
house [320] and gave me clothes to wear.</p>
<p n="552" start-line="14.321" end-line="14.336">There it was that I heard news of Odysseus, for
the king told me he had entertained him, and shown
him much hospitality while he was on his homeward
journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold
and wrought iron that Odysseus had got together.
[325] There was enough to keep his family for ten
generations, so much had he left in the house of
King Pheidon. But the king said Odysseus had gone
to Dodona that he might learn Zeus’ mind from the
god’s high oak tree, and know whether after so
long an absence he should return to the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
Ithaca [330] openly, or in secret. Moreover the
king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings
in his own house as he did so, that the ship was
by the water side, and the crew found, that should
take him to his own country. He sent me off
however before Odysseus returned, for there
happened to be a Thesprotian ship [335] sailing
for the wheat-growing island of Doulikhion, and he
told those in charge of her to be sure and take me
safely to King Akastos.</p>
<p n="553" start-line="14.337" end-line="14.359">These men hatched a plot against me that would
have reduced me to the very extreme of misery, for
when the ship had got some way out from land [340]
they resolved on selling me as a slave. They
stripped me of the khiton and cloak that I was
wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old
clouts in which you now see me; then, towards
nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of sunny
Ithaca, [345] and there they bound me with a
strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on
shore to get supper by the sea side. But the gods
soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my
rags over my head I slid down [350] the rudder
into the sea, where I struck out and swam till I
was well clear of them, and came ashore near a
thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were
very angry at my having escaped [355] and went
searching about for me, till at last they thought
it was no further use and went back to their ship.
The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took
me to a good man’s door—for it seems that I am not
to die yet awhile.”</p>
<p n="554" start-line="14.360" end-line="14.371">[360] To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, “Poor unhappy stranger, I have found the
story of your misfortunes extremely interesting,
but that part about Odysseus is not in order
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>]; and
you will never get me to believe it. Why should a
man like you [365] go about telling lies in this
way? I know all about the return [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of my master.
The gods one and all of them detest him, or they
would have taken him at Troy, or let him die with
friends around him when the days of his fighting
were done; for then the Achaeans would have built
a mound over his ashes [370] and his son would
have been heir to his glory [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>], but now the
storm winds have spirited him away we know not
where.</p>
<p n="555" start-line="14.372" end-line="14.389">As for me I live out of the way here with the
pigs, and never go to the town unless when
circumspect Penelope sends for me on the arrival
of some news about Odysseus. [375] Then they all
sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve
over the king’s absence, and those who rejoice at
it because they can eat up his property without
paying for it. For my own part I have never cared
about asking anyone else since the time when I was
taken in by an Aetolian, [380] who had killed a
man and come a long way till at last he reached my
station, and I was very kind to him. He said he
had seen Odysseus with Idomeneus among the
Cretans, refitting his ships which had been
damaged in a gale. He said Odysseus would return
in the following summer or autumn with his men,
[385] and that he would bring back much wealth.
And now you, you unfortunate old man, since a
superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] has brought you to my door, do
not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes.
It is not for any such reason that I shall treat
you kindly, but only out of respect for Zeus the
god of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying
you.”</p>
<p n="556" start-line="14.390" end-line="14.400">[390] Resourceful Odysseus answered, “I see
that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given
you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let
us then make a bargain, and call all the gods in
the sky to witness it. [395] If your master comes
home, give me a cloak and khiton of good wear, and
send me to Doulikhion where I want to go; but if
he does not come as I say he will, set your men on
to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder
precipice, [400] as a warning to tramps not to go
about the country telling lies.”</p>
<p n="557" start-line="14.401" end-line="14.408">“And excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>] famed among men would be
mine”replied Eumaios, “both now and hereafter, if
I were [405] to kill you after receiving you into
my hut and showing you hospitality. I should have
to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but it
is just time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hōrā</foreign>] for supper, and I hope my men
will come in directly, that we may cook something
savory for supper.”</p>
<p n="558" start-line="14.409" end-line="14.417">Thus did they converse, [410] and presently the
swineherds came up with the pigs, which were then
shut up for the night in their sties, and a
tremendous squealing they made as they were being
driven into them. But Eumaios called to his men
and said, “Bring in the best pig you have, that I
may sacrifice for this stranger, [415] and we will
take toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble
enough this long time feeding pigs, while others
reap the fruit of our labor.”</p>
<p n="559" start-line="14.418" end-line="14.441">Then he began chopping firewood, while the
others brought in a fine fat five year old boar
pig, [420] and set it at the altar. Eumaios did
not forget the gods, for he was a man of good
principles, so the first thing he did was to cut
bristles from the pig’s face and throw them into
the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so
that Odysseus might return home again. [425] Then
he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he
had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,
and its <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē </foreign>left it, while the others
slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up,
and Eumaios began by putting raw pieces from each
joint on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled
with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; [430]
they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the
pieces upon the spits and roasted them till they
were done; when they had taken them off the spits
they threw them on to the dresser in a heap. The
swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then
stood up to give every one his share. He made
seven portions; [435] one of these he set apart
for Hermes, the son of Maia and the nymphs,
praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt
out to the men man by man. He gave Odysseus some
slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of
especial honor, and resourceful Odysseus was much
pleased. [440] “I hope, Eumaios,” said he, “that
Zeus will be as well disposed towards you as I am,
for the respect you are showing to an outcast like
myself.”</p>
<p n="560" start-line="14.442" end-line="14.445">To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios,
“Eat, my good man, and enjoy your supper, such as
it is. A god grants this, and withholds that,
[445] just as he thinks right, for he can do
whatever he chooses.”</p>
<p n="561" start-line="14.446" end-line="14.456">As he spoke he cut off the first piece and
offered it as a burnt sacrifice to the immortal
gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the
cup in the hands of Odysseus, ransacker of cities,
and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulios brought
them their bread; [450] the swineherd had bought
this man on his own account from among the
Taphians during his master’s absence, and had paid
for him with his own wealth without saying
anything either to his mistress or old Laertes.
They then laid their hands upon the good things
that were before them, and when they had had
enough to eat and drink, [455] Mesaulios took away
what was left of the bread, and they all went to
bed after having made a hearty supper.</p>
<p n="562" start-line="14.457" end-line="14.485">Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for
there was no moon. It poured without ceasing, and
the wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet
quarter, so Odysseus thought he would see whether
Eumaios, in the excellent care he took of him,
[460] would take off his own cloak and give it
him, or make one of his men give him one. <seg
rend="subscript">462</seg>“Listen to me now,
Eumaios and all you other companions [<foreign

now that I have shouted out loud, I will not
suppress it. Would that I still had youth and
strength [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>]
as when we got up an ambuscade at Troy. [470]
Atreus’s son, Menelaos, and Odysseus were the
leaders, but I was in command also, for the other
two would have it so. When we had come up to the
wall of the city we crouched down beneath our
armor and lay there under cover of the reeds and
thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp. [475]
It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing;
the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost,
bitter cold, and our shields were coated thick
with rime. [480] The others had all got cloaks and
khitons, and slept comfortably enough with their
shields about their shoulders, but I had
carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking
that I should be too cold, and had gone off in
nothing but my khiton and shield. When the night
was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted
their places, [485] I nudged Odysseus who was
close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me
his ear.</p>
<p n="563" start-line="14.486" end-line="14.489">‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful
Odysseus,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of
me, for I have no cloak; some superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] fooled
me into setting off with nothing on but my khiton,
and I do not know what to do.’</p>
<p n="564" start-line="14.490" end-line="14.494">[490] Odysseus, who was as crafty as he was
valiant, hit upon the following plan [<foreign

said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear
you.’ Then he raised his head on his elbow.</p>
<p n="565" start-line="14.495" end-line="14.498">[495] ‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a
dream from the gods in my sleep. We are a long way
from the ships; I wish someone would go down and
tell Agamemnon to send us up more men at
once.’</p>
<p n="566" start-line="14.499" end-line="14.506">Then Thoas, son of Andraimon, [500] threw off
his cloak and set out running to the ships,
whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably
enough till morning. Would that I still had youth
and strength [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>] as I did in those days, for then
some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak
[505] both out of good will and for the respect
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] due to
a brave warrior; but now people look down upon me
because my clothes are shabby.”</p>
<p n="567" start-line="14.507" end-line="14.517">And Eumaios answered, “Old man, you have told
us an excellent riddling speech [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ainos</foreign>], and have said
nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory;
[510] for the present, therefore, you shall want
neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger
in distress may reasonably expect, but tomorrow
morning you have to shake your own old rags about
your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks
nor khitons up here, but every man has only one.
[515] When Odysseus’ son comes home again he will
give you both cloak and khiton, and send you
wherever you may want to go.”</p>
<p n="568" start-line="14.518" end-line="14.522">With this he got up and made a bed for Odysseus
by throwing some goatskins and sheepskins on the
ground in front of the fire. [520] Here Odysseus
lay down, and Eumaios covered him over with a
great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in
case of extraordinarily bad weather.</p>
<p n="569" start-line="14.523" end-line="14.533">Thus did Odysseus sleep, and the young men
slept beside him. But the swineherd [525] did not
like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready
to go and Odysseus was glad to see that he looked
after his property during his master’s absence.
First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders
and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind.
[530] He also took the skin of a large and well
fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack from men
or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where
the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock
that gave them shelter from the North wind.</p>

you will have been on a fool’s errand. Ask
Menelaos to send you home [15] at once if you wish
to find your excellent mother still there when you
get back. Her father and brothers are already
urging her to marry Eurymakhos, who has given her
more than any of the others, and has been greatly
increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing
valuable may have been taken from the house in
spite of you, [20] but you know what women
are—they always want to do the best they can for
the man who marries them, and never give another
thought to the children of their first husband,
nor to their father either when he is dead and
done with. Go home, therefore, and put everything
[25] in charge of the most respectable woman
servant that you have, until it shall please the
gods to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell
you also of another matter which you had better
attend to. The chief men among the suitors are
lying in wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca
and Samos, [30] and they mean to kill you before
you can reach home. I do not much think they will
succeed; it is more likely that some of those who
are now eating up your property will find a grave
themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship
well away from the islands; the god who watches
[35] over you and protects you will send you a
fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your
ship and men on to the town, but yourself go
straight to the swineherd who has charge of your
pigs; he is well disposed towards you, [40] stay
with him, therefore, for the night, and then send
him to circumspect Penelope to tell her that you
have got back safe from Pylos.”</p>
<p n="572" start-line="15.43" end-line="15.47">Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus
stirred Nestor’s son Peisistratos [45] with his
heel to rouse him, and said, “Wake up
Peisistratos, son of Nestor, and yoke the horses
to the chariot, for we must set off home.”</p>
<p n="573" start-line="15.48" end-line="15.55">But Peisistratos, son of Nestor said, “No
matter what hurry we are in [50] we cannot drive
in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till
spear-famed Menelaos, the son of Atreus, has
brought his presents and put them in the chariot
for us; and let him say good-bye to us in the
usual way. So long as he lives a guest should
never forget [55] a host who has shown him
kindness.”</p>
<p n="574" start-line="15.56" end-line="15.66">As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaos of
the great war cry, who had already risen, leaving
sweet-haired Helen in bed, came towards them. When
Telemachus saw him [60] he put on his khiton as
fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his
shoulders, and went out to meet him. “Great
Menelaos, son of Atreus,” said he, the dear son of
godlike Odysseus [65] “let me go back now to my
own country, for I want to have my homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="575" start-line="15.67" end-line="15.85">And Menelaos answered, “Telemachus, if you
insist on going I will not detain you. I do not
like to see a host [70] either too fond of his
guest or too rude to him. Moderation is best in
all things, and not letting a man go when he wants
to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he
would like to stay. One should treat a guest well
as long as he is in the house and speed him when
he wants to leave it. [75] Wait, then, till I can
get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and
till you have yourself seen them. I will tell the
women to prepare a sufficient dinner for you of
what there may be in the house; it will be at once
more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner
before setting out on such a long journey. If,
moreover, [80] you have a fancy for making a tour
in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my
horses, and will conduct you myself through all
our principal cities. No one will send us away
empty handed; every one will give us something—
[85] a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold
cup.”</p>
<p n="576" start-line="15.86" end-line="15.91">“Great Menelaos, son of Atreus,” replied the
spirited Telemachus, “I want to go home at once,
for when I came away I left my property without
protection, [90] and fear that while looking for
my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find
that something valuable has been stolen during my
absence.”</p>
<p n="577" start-line="15.92" end-line="15.119">When Menelaos of the great war cry heard this
he immediately told his wife and servants to
prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might
be in the house. [95] At this moment Eteoneus the
son of Boethoös, joined him, for he lived close by
and had just got up; so Menelaos told him to light
the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did.
Then Menelaos of the great war cry went down into
his fragrant store room, [100] not alone, but
Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached
the place where the treasures of his house were
kept, he selected a double cup, and told his son
Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl.
Meanwhile Helen, shining among women, went to the
chest [105] where she kept the lovely dresses
which she had made with her own hands, and took
out one that was largest and most beautifully
pattern-woven; it glittered like a star, and lay
at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all
came back through the house again till they got to
[110] Telemachus, and fair-haired Menelaos said,
“Telemachus, may Zeus, the mighty husband of Hera,
give you a safe homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] according to
your desire. [115] I will now present you with the
finest and most precious piece of plate in all my
house. It is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except
the rim, which is inlaid with gold, and it is the
work of Hephaistos. Phaidimos, king of the
Sidonians, made me a present of it in the course
of a visit that I paid him while I was on my
return home. I should like to give it to you.”</p>
<p n="578" start-line="15.120" end-line="15.124">[120] With these words he placed the double cup
in the hands of Telemachus, while Megapenthes
brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it
before him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the
robe ready in her hand.</p>
<p n="579" start-line="15.125" end-line="15.129">[125] “I too, my son,” said she, “have
something for you as a keepsake from the hand of
Helen; it is for your bride to wear at the time
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] of her
wedding. Till then, get your dear mother to keep
it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your
own country and to your home.”</p>
<p n="580" start-line="15.130" end-line="15.153">[130] So saying she gave the robe over to him
and he received it gladly. Then the hero
Peisistratos put the presents into the chariot,
and admired them all as he did so. Presently
fair-haired Menelaos took Telemachus and
Peisistratos into the house, and they both of them
sat down to table. [135] A maid servant brought
them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured
it into a silver basin for them to wash their
hands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an
upper servant brought them bread and offered them
many good things of what there was in the house.
[140] Eteoneus, son of Boethoös, carved the meat
and gave them each their portions, while
Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid
their hands upon the good things that were before
them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat
and drink Telemachus and Peisistratos, the
glorious son of Nestor, [145] yoked the horses,
and took their places in the chariot. They drove
out through the inner gateway and under the
echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and
fair-haired Menelaos, the son of Atreus, came
after them with a golden goblet of wine in his
right hand that they might make a drink-offering
[150] before they set out. He stood in front of
the horses and pledged them, saying, “Farewell to
both of you; see that you tell Nestor, shepherd of
the people, how I have treated you, for he was as
kind to me as any father could be while we
Achaeans were fighting at Troy.”</p>
<p n="581" start-line="15.154" end-line="15.159">[155] “We will be sure, sir,” answered the
spirited Telemachus, “to tell him everything as
soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of
finding Odysseus returned when I get back to
Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great
kindness you have shown me and of the many
beautiful presents I am taking with me.”</p>
<p n="582" start-line="15.160" end-line="15.168">[160] As he was thus speaking a bird flew on
his right hand—an eagle with a great white goose
in its talons which it had carried off from the
farm yard—and all the men and women were running
after it and shouting. It came quite close up to
them and flew away on their right hands in front
of the horses. [165] When they saw it they were
glad, and their hearts took comfort within them,
whereon Peisistratos, son of Nestor, said, “Tell
me, Menelaos, <seg rend="subscript">168</seg> did
the god make as a vision this portent [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">teras</foreign>] for you or for
the two of us?”</p>
<p n="583" start-line="15.169" end-line="15.178">Warlike Menelaos was thinking [170] what would
be the most proper answer for him to make, but
Helen was too quick for him and said, “I will read
this matter as the gods have put it in my heart,
and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The
eagle came from the mountain where it was bred
[175] and has its nest, and in like manner
Odysseus, after having traveled far and suffered
much, will return to take his revenge—if indeed he
is not back already and hatching mischief for the
suitors.”</p>
<p n="584" start-line="15.179" end-line="15.181">[180] “May Zeus, high thundering husband of
Hera, so grant it,” replied the spirited
Telemachus; “if it should prove to be so, I will
make vows to you as though you were a god, even
when I am at home.”</p>
<p n="585" start-line="15.182" end-line="15.188">As he spoke he lashed his horses and they
started off at full speed through the town towards
the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their
necks and traveled the whole day long [185] till
the sun set and darkness was over all the land.
Then they reached Pherai, where Diokles lived who
was son of Ortilokhos, the son of Alpheus. There
they passed the night and were treated hospitably.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, [190] they again yoked their horses and
took their places in the chariot. They drove out
through the inner gateway and under the echoing
gatehouse of the outer court. Then Peisistratos
lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing
loath; before long they came to Pylos, and then
Telemachus said:</p>
<p n="586" start-line="15.189" end-line="15.201">[195] “Peisistratos, son of Nestor, I hope you
will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You
know our fathers were old friends before us;
moreover, we are both of an age, and this journey
has brought us together still more closely; do
not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me
[200] there, for if I go to your father’s house he
will try to keep me in the warmth of his good will
towards me, and I must go home at once.”</p>
<p n="587" start-line="15.202" end-line="15.214">Peisistratos, son of Nestor, thought how he
should do as he was asked, and in the end he
thought it best [205] to turn his horses towards
the ship, and put Menelaos’ beautiful presents of
gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then
he said, “Go on board at once and tell your men to
do so also [210] before I can reach home to tell
my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure
he will not let you go; he will come down here to
fetch you, and he will not go back without you.
But he will be very angry.”</p>
<p n="588" start-line="15.215" end-line="15.219">[215] With this he drove his goodly steeds back
to the city of the Pylians and soon reached his
home, but Telemachus called the men together and
gave his orders. “Now, my men,” said he, “get
everything in order on board the ship, and let us
set out home.”</p>
<p n="589" start-line="15.220" end-line="15.255">[220] Thus did he speak, and they went on board
even as he had said. But as Telemachus was thus
busied, praying also and sacrificing to Athena in
the ship’s stern, there came to him a man from a
distant locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], a seer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>], who was fleeing
from Argos because he had killed a man. [225] He
was descended from Melampos, who used to live in
Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a
great house, but he was driven into exile by the
great and powerful King Neleus. [230] Neleus
seized by force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>] his goods and held them for a
whole year, during which he was a close prisoner
in the house of King Phylakos, and in much
distress of mind both on account of the daughter
of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great
aberration [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>atē</foreign>] that dread Furies [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">Erinyes</foreign>] had laid upon
him. [235] In the end, however, he escaped with
his life, drove the cattle from Phylake to Pylos,
avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave
the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he
left the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign> and went to horse-pasturing
Argos, where it was ordained [240] that he should
reign over much people. There he married,
established himself, and had two famous sons
Antiphates and Mantios. Antiphates became father
of great-hearted Oikles, and Oikles of Amphiaraos,
[245] who was dearly loved both by Zeus and by
Apollo, but he did not live to old age, for he was
killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His
sons were Alkmaion and Amphilokhos. Mantios, the
other son of Melampos, was father to Polypheides
and Kleitos. [250] The Dawn goddess, throned in
gold, carried off Kleitos <seg rend="subscript"
>251</seg> on account of his beauty, so that he
might be among the Immortals, but Apollo made
high-hearted Polypheides the greatest seer
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] in the
whole world now that Amphiaraos was dead. He
quarreled with his father and went to live in
Hyperesia, [255] where he remained and prophesied
for all men.</p>
<p n="590" start-line="15.256" end-line="15.264">His son, Theoklymenos, it was who now came up
to Telemachus as he was making drink-offerings and
praying in his ship. [260] “Friend,’” said he,
“now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I
beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and by
the superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] to whom you make them, I pray
you also by your own head and by those of your
followers, tell me the truth and nothing but the
truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of
your town and parents.”</p>
<p n="591" start-line="15.265" end-line="15.270">[265] The spirited Telemachus said, “I will
answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my
father is Odysseus, as surely as that he ever
lived. But he has come to some miserable end.
Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew
together [270] to see if I can hear any news of
him, for he has been away a long time.”</p>
<p n="592" start-line="15.271" end-line="15.278">“I too,” answered godlike Theoklymenos, “am an
exile, for I have killed a man of my own lineage.
He has many brothers and kinsmen in
horse-pasturing Argos, and they have great power
among the Argives. [275] I am fleeing to escape
death at their hands, and am thus doomed to be a
wanderer on the face of the earth. I am your
suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship
that they may not kill me, for I know they are in
pursuit.”</p>
<p n="593" start-line="15.279" end-line="15.281">[280] “I will not refuse you,” replied the
spirited Telemachus, “if you wish to join us.
Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you
hospitably according to what we have.”</p>
<p n="594" start-line="15.282" end-line="15.291">Then he received Theoklymenos’ spear and laid
it down on the deck of the ship. He went on board
[285] and sat in the stern, bidding Theoklymenos
sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers.
Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes,
and they made all haste to do so. They set the
mast [290] in its socket in the cross plank,
raised it and made it fast with the forestays, and
they hoisted their white sails with sheets of
twisted ox-hide. The owl-vision goddess Athena
sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and strong
to take the ship on her course as fast as
possible. [295] Thus then they passed by Krounoi
and Khalkis.</p>
<p n="595" start-line="15.292" end-line="15.300">Presently the sun set and darkness was over all
the land. The vessel made a quick passage to Pheai
and thence on to Elis, where the Epeioi rule.
Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,
[300] wondering within himself whether he should
escape death or should be taken prisoner.</p>
<p n="596" start-line="15.301" end-line="15.324">Meanwhile Odysseus and the swineherd were
eating their supper in the hut, and the men supped
with them. As soon as they had had enough to eat
and drink, Odysseus began trying to prove the
swineherd and see [305] whether he would continue
to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the
station or pack him off to the city; so he said:
“Eumaios, and all of you, tomorrow I want to go
away and begin begging about the town, so as to be
no more trouble to you or to your men. Give me
[310] your advice therefore, and let me have a
good guide to go with me and show me the way. I
will go the round of the city begging as I needs
must, to see if anyone will give me a drink and a
piece of bread. I should like also to go to the
house of godlike Odysseus and bring news of her
husband to the queen, circumspect Penelope. [315]
I could then go about among the suitors and see if
out of all their abundance they will give me a
dinner. I should soon make them an excellent
servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and believe
when I tell you that by the blessing of Hermes,
the guide, who gives grace [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] [320] and good
name to the works of all men, there is no one
living who would make a more handy servant than I
should—to put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel,
carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those
services that poor men have to do for their
betters.”</p>
<p n="597" start-line="15.325" end-line="15.339">[325] The swineherd was very much disturbed
when he heard this. “Heaven help me,” he
exclaimed, “what ever can have put such a notion
as that into your head? If you go near the suitors
you will be undone to a certainty, for their
overweening pride [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hubris</foreign>] and violent insolence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] reach [330] all the
way to the sky. They would never think of taking a
man like you for a servant. Their servants are all
young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and
khitons, with well looking faces and their hair
always tidy, the well-polished tables are kept
quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and
wine. [335] Stay where you are, then; you are not
in anybody’s way; I do not mind your being here,
no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus,
dear son of Odysseus, comes home he will give you
a khiton and cloak and will send you wherever you
want to go.”</p>
<p n="598" start-line="15.340" end-line="15.350">[340] Much-enduring great Odysseus answered, “I
hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to
me, for having saved me from going about and
getting into trouble; there is nothing worse than
being always on the tramp; still, when men have
once got low down in the world [345] they will go
through a great deal on behalf of their miserable
bellies. Since however you press me to stay here
and await the return of Telemachus, tell about
godlike Odysseus’ mother, and his father whom he
left on the threshold of old age when he set out
for Troy. Are they still living [350] or are they
already dead and in the house of Hādēs?”</p>
<p n="599" start-line="15.351" end-line="15.379">“I will tell you all about them,” replied
Eumaios, the swineherd and leader of men. “Laertes
is still living and prays the gods to let him
depart peacefully his own house, [355] for he is
terribly distressed about the absence of his son,
and also about the death of his wife, which
grieved him greatly and aged him more than
anything else did. She came to an unhappy end
through sorrow for her son: may no friend or
neighbor who has dealt kindly by me [360] come to
such an end as she did. As long as she was still
living, though she was always grieving, I used to
like seeing her and asking her how she did, for
she brought me up along with her daughter Ktimene
of the light robes, the youngest of her children;
[365] we were boy and girl together, and she made
little difference between us. When, however, we
both grew up, they sent Ktimene to Samē and
received a splendid dowry for her. As for me, my
mistress gave me a good khiton and cloak with a
pair of sandals for my feet, [370] and sent me off
into the country, but she was just as fond of me
as ever. This is all over now. Still it has
pleased the gods to make my work prosper in the
situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat
and drink, and can find something for any
respectable stranger who comes here; but there is
no getting [375] a kind word or deed out of my
mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands
of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see
their mistress and have a talk with her; they like
to have something to eat and drink at the house,
and something too to take back with them into the
country. This is what will keep servants in a good
humor.”</p>
<p n="600" start-line="15.380" end-line="15.388">[380] Resourceful Odysseus answered, “Then you
must have been very little, Eumaios, when you were
taken so far away from your home and parents. Tell
me, and tell me true, was the city [385] in which
your father and mother lived ransacked and
pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when
you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you
off here, and sell you for whatever your master
gave them?”</p>
<p n="601" start-line="15.389" end-line="15.401">[390] “Stranger,” replied Eumaios, the
swineherd and leader of men, “as regards your
question: sit still, make yourself comfortable,
drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights are
now at their longest; there is plenty of time both
for sleeping and sitting up talking together; you
ought not to go to bed till it is time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>], too much sleep is
[395] as bad as too little; if any one of the
others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do
so; he can then take my master’s pigs out when he
has done breakfast in the morning. We two will sit
here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling
one another stories [400] about our misfortunes;
for when a man has suffered much, and been
buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in
recalling the memory of sorrows that have long
gone by.</p>
<p n="602" start-line="15.402" end-line="15.414">As regards your question, then, my tale is as
follows: You may have heard of an island called
Syra that lies over above Ortygia, where the land
begins to turn round and look in another
direction. [405] It is not very thickly peopled,
but the soil is good, with much pasture fit for
cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and
wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the
people [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]
plagued by any sickness, but when they grow old
[410] Apollo of the silver bow comes with Artemis
and kills them with his painless shafts. It
contains two communities, and the whole country is
divided between these two. My father Ktesios, son
of Ormenos, a man comparable to the gods, reigned
over both.</p>
<p n="603" start-line="15.415" end-line="15.429">[415] Now to this place there came some cunning
traders from Phoenicia (for the Phoenicians are
great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted
with trinkets of all kinds. There happened to be a
Phoenician woman in my father’s house, very tall
and comely, and an excellent servant; these
scoundrels got hold of her one day [420] when she
was washing near their ship, seduced her, and
cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no
matter how good she may be by nature. The man who
had seduced her asked her who she was and where
she came from, and on this she told him her
father’s name. [425] ‘I come from Sidon,’ said
she, ‘and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in
wealth and rich in bronze. One day as I was coming
into the town from the country some Taphian
pirates seized me and took me here over the sea,
where they sold me to the man who owns this house,
and he gave them their price for me.’</p>
<p n="604" start-line="15.430" end-line="15.433">[430] The man who had seduced her then said,
‘Would you like to come along with us to see the
house of your parents and your parents themselves?
They are both alive and are said to be well
off.’</p>
<p n="605" start-line="15.434" end-line="15.436">[435] ‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if
you men will first swear me a solemn oath that you
will do me no harm by the way.’</p>
<p n="606" start-line="15.437" end-line="15.453">They all swore as she told them, and when they
had completed their oath the woman said, [440]
‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the
street or at the well, do not let him speak to me,
for fear some one should go and tell my master, in
which case he would suspect something. He would
put me in prison, and would have all of you
murdered; [445] keep your own counsel therefore;
buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send
me word when you have done loading. I will bring
as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there
is something else also that I can do [450] towards
paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good
man of the house, a funny little thing just able
to run about. I will carry him off in your ship,
and you will get a great deal of wealth for him if
you take him and sell him in foreign parts.’</p>
<p n="607" start-line="15.454" end-line="15.484">Then she went back to the house. [455] The
Phoenicians stayed a whole year till they had
loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,
and then, when they had got freight enough, they
sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very
cunning man, came to my father’s house [460]
bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads
strung among it; and while my mother and the
servants had it in their hands admiring it and
bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the
woman and then went back [465] to the ship,
whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of
the house. In the fore part of the house she saw
the tables set with the cups of guests who had
been feasting with my father, as being in
attendance on him; these were now all gone to an
assembly of the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], so she snatched up three cups
and carried them off in the bosom of her dress,
[470] while I followed her, for I knew no better.
The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the
land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we
reached the harbor, where the fast-running
Phoenician ship was lying. [475] When they had got
on board they sailed their ways over the sea,
taking us with them, and Zeus, son of Kronos, sent
them a fair wind; six days did we sail both night
and day, but on the seventh day Artemis of the
showering arrows struck the woman and she fell
heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she
were a sea gull alighting on the water; [480] so
they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes,
and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently
the winds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where
Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and
thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this
country.”</p>
<p n="608" start-line="15.485" end-line="15.492">[485] Illustrious Odysseus answered, “Eumaios,
I have heard the story of your misfortunes with
the most lively interest and pity, but Zeus has
given you good as well as evil, for in spite of
everything you have a good [490] master, who sees
that you always have enough to eat and drink; and
you lead a good life, whereas I am still going
about begging my way from city to city.”</p>
<p n="609" start-line="15.493" end-line="15.507">Thus did they converse, and they had only a
very little time left for sleep, [495] for it was
soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and his
crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails,
took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the
harbor. They cast out their mooring stones and
made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the
sea shore, [500] mixed their wine, and got dinner
ready. As soon as they had had enough to eat and
drink the spirited Telemachus said, “Take the ship
on to the town, but leave me here, for I want to
look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. [505]
In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I
will come down to the city, and tomorrow morning
in return for your trouble I will give you all a
good dinner with meat and wine.”</p>
<p n="610" start-line="15.508" end-line="15.511">Then godlike Theoklymenos said, ‘And what, my
dear young friend, is to become of me? To whose
house, [510] among all your chief men, am I to
repair? Or shall I go straight to your own house
and to your mother?”</p>
<p n="611" start-line="15.512" end-line="15.524">“At any other time,” replied the spirited
Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go to my own
house, for you would find no want of hospitality;
at the present moment, however, you would not be
comfortable there, [515] for I shall be away, and
my mother will not see you; she does not often
show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her
loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of their
way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can
go to—I mean Eurymakhos, the godlike son of
prudent Polybos, [520] who is held in the highest
estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the
best man and the most persistent wooer, of all
those who are paying court to my mother and trying
to take Odysseus’ place. Zeus the Olympian alone,
however, in his celestial dwelling knows whether
or not they will come to a bad end before the
marriage takes place.”</p>
<p n="612" start-line="15.525" end-line="15.534">[525] As he was speaking a bird flew by upon
his right hand—a hawk, Apollo’s messenger. It held
a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore
them off, fell to the ground midway between
Telemachus and the ship. Then Theoklymenos called
him apart [530] and caught him by the hand.
“Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not fly on
your right hand without having been sent there by
some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an
omen; it means that you will remain powerful and
that there will be no house in the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
Ithaca more royal than your own.”</p>
<p n="613" start-line="15.535" end-line="15.538">[535] “I wish it may prove so,” answered the
spirited Telemachus. “If it does, I will show you
so much good will and give you so many presents
that all who meet you will congratulate you.” Then
he said to his friend Piraios, [540] “Piraios, son
of Klytios, you have throughout shown yourself the
most willing to serve me of all those who have
accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take
this stranger to your own house and entertain him
hospitably till I can come for him.”</p>
<p n="614" start-line="15.539" end-line="15.546">And spear-famed Piraios answered, [545]
“Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you
please, but I will look after him for you, and he
shall find no lack of hospitality.”</p>
<p n="615" start-line="15.547" end-line="15.557">As he spoke he went on board, and bade the
others do so also and loose the hawsers, so they
took their places in the ship. [550] But
Telemachus bound on his sandals, and took a long
and doughty spear with a head of sharpened bronze
from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the
hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made
on towards the city as they had been told to do,
[555] while Telemachus, beloved son of godlike
Odysseus, strode on as fast as he could, till he
reached the homestead where his countless herds of
swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent
swineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his
master.</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 16</head>
<p n="616" start-line="16.1" end-line="16.7" rend="no-indent">Meanwhile Odysseus and the
noble swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were
getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had
sent the men out with the pigs. When Telemachus
came up, [5] the dogs did not bark, but fawned
upon him, so great Odysseus, hearing the sound of
feet and noticing that the dogs did not bark, said
to Eumaios:</p>
<p n="617" start-line="16.8" end-line="16.10">“Eumaios, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of
your men or some one of your acquaintance is
coming here, [10] for the dogs are fawning upon
him and not barking.”</p>
<p n="618" start-line="16.11" end-line="16.22">The words were hardly out of his mouth before
his son stood at the door. Eumaios sprang to his
feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing wine
fell from his hands, as he made towards his
master. [15] He kissed his head and both his
beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could
not be more delighted at the return of an only
son, the child of his old age, after ten years’
absence in a foreign country and after having gone
through much hardship. [20] He embraced him,
kissed him all over as though he had come back
from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:</p>
<p n="619" start-line="16.23" end-line="16.29">“So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes
that you are. When I heard you had gone to Pylos I
was sure I was never going to see you any more.
[25] Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I
may gladden my heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thūmos</foreign>] looking at you now you are home
again; it is not very often you come into the
country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close
to the town generally. I suppose you think it
better to keep an eye on what the suitors are
doing.”</p>
<p n="620" start-line="16.30" end-line="16.35">[30] “So be it, old friend,” answered the
spirited Telemachus, “but I am come now because I
want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is
still at her old home or whether some one else has
married her, so that the bed of Odysseus [35] is
without bedding and covered with cobwebs.”</p>
<p n="621" start-line="16.36" end-line="16.39">“She is still at the house,” replied Eumaios,
“grieving and breaking her heart, and doing
nothing but weep, both night and day
continually.”</p>
<p n="622" start-line="16.40" end-line="16.45">[40] As he spoke he took Telemachus’ spear,
whereon he crossed the stone threshold and came
inside. Odysseus rose from his seat to give him
place as he entered, but Telemachus checked him;
“Sit down, stranger.” said he, “I can easily find
another seat, [45] and there is one here who will
lay it for me.”</p>
<p n="623" start-line="16.46" end-line="16.56">Odysseus went back to his own place, and
Eumaios strewed some green brushwood on the floor
and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus
to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them
platters of cold [50] meat, the remains from what
they had eaten the day before, and he filled the
bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He
mixed wine also in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his
seat facing godlike Odysseus. Then they laid their
hands on the good things that were before them,
[55] and as soon as they had had enough to eat and
drink Telemachus said to noble Eumaios,</p>
<p n="624" start-line="16.57" end-line="16.67">“Old friend, where does this stranger come
from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and
who were they?—for assuredly he did not come here
by land” [60] To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, “My son, I will tell you what is really
true [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>alēthēs</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>62</seg>He proclaims that he is by birth from
Crete [plural], the far-and-wide, <seg
rend="subscript">63</seg> and he says that he has
wandered around over many cities of mortals, <seg
rend="subscript">64</seg> veering from his path.
[65] At this moment he is running away from a
Thesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so
I will put him into your hands. Do whatever you
like with him, only remember that he is your
suppliant.”</p>
<p n="625" start-line="16.68" end-line="16.89">“I am very much distressed,” said the spirited
Telemachus, “by what you have just told me. [70]
How can I take this stranger into my house? I am
as yet young, and am not strong enough to hold my
own if any man attacks me. My mother cannot make
up her mind whether to stay where she is and look
after the house out of respect for the opinion of
the people of the district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] [75] and for the
memory of her husband, or whether the time is now
come for her to take the best man of those who are
wooing her, and the one who will make her the most
advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has
come to your station I will find him a cloak and
khiton of good wear, [80] with a sword and
sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to
go. Or if you like you can keep him here at the
station, and I will send him clothes and food that
he may be no burden on you and on your men; [85]
but I will not have him go near the suitors, for
they have much insolence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hubris</foreign>], and they are sure to ill-treat
him in a way that would give me grief [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]; no matter how
valiant a man may be he can do nothing against
numbers, for they will be too strong for him.”</p>
<p n="626" start-line="16.90" end-line="16.111">[90] Then long-suffering great Odysseus said,
“Sir, it is right that I should say something
myself. I am much shocked about what you have said
about the insolent way in which the suitors are
behaving in despite of such a man [95] as you are.
Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely,
or do the people of your district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], following the
voice of some god, consider you hateful [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ekhthros</foreign>]? May you not
complain of your brothers—for it is to these that
a man may look for support, however great his
quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are
and in my present mind; [100] if I were son to
stately Odysseus, or, indeed, Odysseus himself, I
would rather some one came and cut my head off,
but I would go to the house of the son of Laertes
and be the bane of every one of these men. [105]
If they were too many for me—I being
single-handed—I would rather die fighting in my
own house than see such disgraceful sights day
after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men
dragging the women servants about the house in an
unseemly way, [110] wine drawn recklessly, and
bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that
shall never be accomplished.”</p>
<p n="627" start-line="16.112" end-line="16.134">And the spirited Telemachus answered, “I will
tell you truly everything. There is no enmity
between me and the people of my district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], [115] nor can I
complain of brothers, to whom a man may look for
support however great his quarrel may be. Zeus has
made us a lineage of only sons. Laertes was the
only son of Arkeisios, and Odysseus only son of
Laertes. [120] I am myself the only son of
Odysseus who left me behind him when he went away,
so that I have never been of any use to him. Hence
it comes that my house is in the hands of
numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the
neighboring islands, Doulikhion, Samē, wooded
Zakynthos, as also all the principal men of Ithaca
itself, [125] are eating up my house under the
pretext of paying court to my mother, who will
neither say point blank that she will not marry,
nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are
making havoc of my estate, and before long will do
so with myself into the bargain. The issue,
however, rests with the gods. [130] But do you,
old friend Eumaios, go at once and tell Penelope
that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell
it to herself alone, and then come back here
without letting anyone else know, for there are
many who are plotting mischief against me.”</p>
<p n="628" start-line="16.135" end-line="16.145">[135] “I understand and heed you,” replied
Eumaios; “you need instruct me no further, only as
I am going that way say whether I had not better
let poor Laertes know that you are returned. [140]
He used to superintend the work on his farm in
spite of his bitter sorrow about Odysseus, and he
would eat and drink at will along with his
servants; but they tell me that from the day on
which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten
nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look
after his farm, [145] but sits weeping and wasting
the flesh from off his bones.”</p>
<p n="629" start-line="16.146" end-line="16.153">“More is the pity,” answered the spirited
Telemachus, “I am sorry for him, but we must leave
him to himself just now. If people could have
everything their own way, the first thing I should
choose would be the return of my father; [150] but
go, and give your message; then make haste back
again, and do not turn out of your way to tell
Laertes. Tell my mother to send one of her women
secretly with the news at once, and let him hear
it from her.”</p>
<p n="630" start-line="16.154" end-line="16.166">Thus did he urge the swineherd; [155] Eumaios,
therefore, took his sandals, bound them to his
feet, and started for the town. Athena watched him
well off the station, and then came up to it in
the form of a woman—fair, stately, and high-
spirited. She stood against the side of the entry,
and revealed herself to Odysseus, [160] but
Telemachus could not see her, and knew not that
she was there, for the gods do not let themselves
be seen by everybody. Odysseus saw her, and so did
the dogs, for they did not bark, but went scared
and whining off to the other side of the yards.
She nodded her head and motioned to noble Odysseus
with her eyebrows; [165] whereon he left the hut
and stood before her outside the main wall of the
yards. Then she said to him:</p>
<p n="631" start-line="16.167" end-line="16.171">“Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of Laertes and
seed of Zeus, it is now time for you to tell your
son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but
lay your plans for the destruction of the suitors,
[170] and then make for the town. I will not be
long in joining you, for I too am eager for the
fray.”</p>
<p n="632" start-line="16.172" end-line="16.180"><seg rend="subscript">172</seg> So spoke
Athena, and she touched him [= Odysseus] with her
golden wand. <seg rend="subscript">173</seg> First
she made his mantle and his tunic to be cleanly
washed, <seg rend="subscript">174</seg> she made
it be that way, what he was wearing over his
chest, and she augmented his size and his
youthfulness. [175] His tan complexion came back,
and his jaws got firmed up, <seg rend="subscript"
>176</seg> and dark again became the beard around
his chin. <seg rend="subscript">177</seg> Then she
[= Athena], having done her work, went back where
she came from, while <seg rend="subscript"
>178</seg> Odysseus headed for the shelter. His
dear son [= Telemachus] marveled at him, <seg
rend="subscript">179</seg> and, in his amazement,
he [= Telemachus] cast his gaze away from him, in
another direction, fearing that he [= Odysseus]
might be a god. [180] And he [= Telemachus]
addressed him [= Odysseus], speaking winged
words:</p>
<p n="633" start-line="16.181" end-line="16.185"><seg rend="subscript">181</seg> “As a different
kind of person [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>alloios</foreign>], stranger, have you appeared
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phainesthai</foreign>]
to me just now, different than before. <seg
rend="subscript">182</seg> You have different
clothes and your complexion is no longer the same
kind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>homoios</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>183</seg> You must be some god, one of those gods
who hold the wide sky. <seg rend="subscript"
>184</seg> So be gracious, in order that we may
give you pleasing sacrifices [185] and golden
gifts of good workmanship. Have mercy on us.”</p>
<p n="634" start-line="16.186" end-line="16.189"><seg rend="subscript">186</seg> And he [=
Telemachus] was answered then by the one who
suffered many things, the radiant Odysseus: <seg
rend="subscript">187</seg> “I am not some god. Why
do you liken [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>eïskein</foreign>] me to the immortals? <seg
rend="subscript">188</seg> But I am your father,
for whom you mourn and <seg rend="subscript"
>189</seg> suffer many pains, enduring the violent
acts of men.”</p>
<p n="635" start-line="16.190" end-line="16.200">[190] Having said these things, he kissed his
son and let fall from his cheeks <seg
rend="subscript">191</seg> a tear, letting it fall
to the ground. Until then he had persisted in
showing no sign of pity. <seg rend="subscript"
>192</seg>And Telemachus, since he was not yet
convinced that he [= Odysseus] was his
father, <seg rend="subscript">193</seg>once again
addressed him with words in reply: <seg
rend="subscript">194</seg> “You are not Odysseus
my father. Instead, some superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] [195]
is enchanting me, and it makes me weep and mourn
even more. <seg rend="subscript">196</seg> I say
this because no mortal man could craft these
things that are happening to me, <seg
rend="subscript">197</seg> no mortal could do
these things by way of his own devising [<foreign

comes in person <seg rend="subscript"

<p n="636" start-line="16.201" end-line="16.212"><seg rend="subscript">201</seg> He was answered
by Odysseus, the one with many kinds of craft, who
addressed him thus: <seg rend="subscript"
>202</seg> “Telemachus, it does not seem right [=
perfect of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>eïskein</foreign>] for you to be amazed at your

to be amazed too much or to feel overwhelmed. <seg
rend="subscript">204</seg> There will never again
be some different [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>allos</foreign>] person who comes here, some
different Odysseus, [205] but here I am such
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">toiosde</foreign>] as I
am. I have had many bad things happen to me. I
have been detoured in many different ways. <seg
rend="subscript">206</seg> But now I am here,
having come back in the twentieth year to the land
of my ancestors. <seg rend="subscript">207</seg> I
tell you, this was the work of Athena, the giver
of prizes, <seg rend="subscript">208</seg> who has
made me be such [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

has the power. <seg rend="subscript">209</seg> One
moment, she has made me to be looking like
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">enalinkios</foreign>] a
beggar, and then, the next moment, [210] like a
young man who has beautiful clothes covering his
complexion. <seg rend="subscript">211</seg> It is
easy for the gods, who hold the wide sky, <seg
rend="subscript">212</seg> to make a mortal man
become exalted with radiance or to debase
him.”</p>
<p n="637" start-line="16.213" end-line="16.224">As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw
his arms about his father [215] and wept. They
were both so much moved that they cried aloud like
eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have
been robbed of their half fledged young by
peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, [220] and
the sun would have gone down upon their mourning
if Telemachus had not suddenly said, “In what
ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to
Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves
to be—for you cannot have come by land?”</p>
<p n="638" start-line="16.225" end-line="16.239">[225] “I will tell you the truth [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alētheia</foreign>], my son,”
replied long-suffering great Odysseus. “It was the
Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great
sailors, and are in the habit of giving escorts to
anyone who reaches their coasts. They took me over
the sea while I was fast asleep, [230] and landed
me in Ithaca, after giving me many presents in
bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by the
gods’ mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I
am now come here on the suggestion of Athena that
we may consult about killing our enemies. [235]
First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors,
with their number, that I may learn who, and how
many, they are. I can then turn the matter over in
my mind, and see whether we two can fight the
whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must
find others to help us.”</p>
<p n="639" start-line="16.240" end-line="16.258">[240] To this the spirited Telemachus answered,
“Father, I have always heard of your renown
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] both in
the field and in council, but the task you talk of
is a very great one: I am awed at the mere thought
of it; two men cannot stand against many and brave
ones. [245] There are not ten suitors only, nor
twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall
learn their number at once. There are fifty-two
chosen [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>krinein</foreign>] youths from Doulikhion, and
they have six servants; from Samē there are
twenty-four; [250] twenty young Achaeans from
Zakynthos, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of
them well born. They have with them a servant
Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at table.
If we face such numbers as this, [255] you may
have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your
violent revenge [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

some one who would be willing to come and help
us.”</p>
<p n="640" start-line="16.259" end-line="16.261">“Listen to me,” replied long-suffering great
Odysseus, [260] “and think whether Athena and her
father Zeus may seem sufficient, or whether I am
to try and find some one else as well.”</p>
<p n="641" start-line="16.262" end-line="16.265">“Those whom you have named,” answered the
spirited Telemachus, “are a couple of good allies,
for though they dwell high up among the clouds
they have power [265] over both gods and men.”</p>
<p n="642" start-line="16.266" end-line="16.307">“These two,” continued long-suffering great
Odysseus, “will not keep long out of the fray,
when the suitors and we join fight in my house.
[270] Now, therefore, return home early tomorrow
morning, and go about among the suitors as before.
Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city
disguised as a miserable old beggar. If you see
them ill-treating me, [275] steel your heart
against my sufferings; even though they drag me
feet foremost out of the house, or throw things at
me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying to
make them behave more reasonably; but they will
not [280] listen to you, for the day of their
reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and lay
my saying to your heart, when Athena shall put it
in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on
seeing me do this you must collect all the armor
that is in the house [285] and hide it in the
strong store room. Make some excuse when the
suitors ask you why you are removing it; say that
you have taken it to be out of the way of the
smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was
when Odysseus went away, [290] but has become
soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more
particularly that you are afraid Zeus, son of
Kronos, may set them on to quarrel over their
wine, and that they may do each other some harm
which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for
the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use
them. [295] But leave a sword and a spear apiece
for yourself and me, and a couple ox-hide shields
so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Zeus
and Athena will then soon quiet these people.
There is also another matter; [300] if you are
indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let
no one know that Odysseus is within the
house—neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor
any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself.
Let you and me make trial of the women alone,
[305] and let us also make trial of some other of
the men servants, to see who is on our side and
whose hand is against us.”</p>
<p n="643" start-line="16.308" end-line="16.320">“Father,” replied Telemachus, “you will come to
know me by and by, [310] and when you do you will
find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,
however, the plan you propose will be a gain
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>] for
either of us. Think it over. It will take us a
long time to go the round of the farms and exploit
the men, and all the time the suitors [315] will
be wasting your estate with impunity and without
compunction. Prove the women by all means, to see
who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not
in favor of going round and trying the men. We can
attend to that later on, [320] if you really have
some sign from Zeus of the aegis that he will
support you.”</p>
<p n="644" start-line="16.321" end-line="16.341">Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship
which had brought Telemachus and his crew from
Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When they
had come inside the harbor [325] they drew the
ship on to the land; their servants came and took
their armor from them, and they left all the
presents at the house of Klytios. Then they sent a
servant to tell circumspect Penelope that [330]
Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent
the ship to the town to prevent her from being
alarmed and made unhappy. This servant and Eumaios
happened to meet when they were both on the same
errand of going to tell Penelope. [335] When they
reached the house, the servant stood up and said
to the queen in the presence of the waiting women,
“Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos”; but
Eumaios went close up to Penelope, and said
privately that her son had [340] bidden him tell
her. When he had given his message he left the
house with its outbuildings and went back to his
pigs again.</p>
<p n="645" start-line="16.342" end-line="16.345">The suitors were surprised and angry at what
had happened, so they went outside the great wall
that ran round the outer court, and held a council
near the main entrance. [345] Eurymakhos, son of
Polybos, was the first to speak.</p>
<p n="646" start-line="16.346" end-line="16.350">“My friends,” said he, “this voyage of
Telemachus’ is a very serious matter; we had been
sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,
let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew
together to send after the others [350] and tell
them to come back as fast as they can.”</p>
<p n="647" start-line="16.351" end-line="16.357">He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomos
turned in his place and saw the ship inside the
harbor, with the crew lowering her sails, and
putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to
the others, [355] “We need not send them any
message, for they are here. Some god must have
told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and
could not overtake her.”</p>
<p n="648" start-line="16.358" end-line="16.362">Then they rose and went to the water side. The
crew then drew the ship on shore; [360] their
servants took their armor from them, and they went
up in a body to the place of assembly, but they
would not let anyone old or young sit along with
them, and Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, spoke
first.</p>
<p n="649" start-line="16.363" end-line="16.392">“Skies above,” said he, “see how the gods have
saved this man from destruction. [365] We kept a
succession of scouts upon the headlands all day
long, and when the sun was down we never went on
shore to sleep, but waited in the ship all night
till morning in the hope of capturing and killing
him; [370] but some superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] has conveyed him
home in spite of us. Let us consider how we can
make an end of him. He must not escape us; our
affair is never likely to come off while is alive,
for he is very shrewd in thinking [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], [375] and public
feeling is by no means all on our side. We must
make haste before he can call the Achaeans in
assembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he
will be furious with us, and will tell all the
world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to
take him. [380] The people will not like this when
they come to know of it; we must see that they do
us no hurt, nor drive us from our own locale
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] into
exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on
his farm away from the town, or on the road here.
[385] Then we can divide up his property amongst
us, and let his mother and the man who marries her
have the house. If this does not please you, and
you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his
father’s property, then we must not gather here
and eat up [390] his goods in this way, but must
make our offers to Penelope each from his own
house, and she can marry the man who will give the
most for her, and whose lot it is to win her.”</p>
<p n="650" start-line="16.393" end-line="16.405">They all held their peace until Amphinomos rose
to speak. He was [395] the son of Nisos, who was
son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all
the suitors from the wheat-growing and well
grassed island of Doulikhion; his conversation,
moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that
of any of the other for he was a man of good
natural disposition. [400] “My friends,” said he,
speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, “I
am not in favor of killing Telemachus. It is a
heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood.
Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the
oracles of great Zeus advise it, I will both help
to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to
do so; [405] but if they dissuade us, I would have
you hold your hands.”</p>
<p n="651" start-line="16.406" end-line="16.408">Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them
well, so they rose right away and went to the
house of Odysseus where they took their accustomed
seats.</p>
<p n="652" start-line="16.409" end-line="16.417">Then circumspect Penelope resolved [410] that
she would show herself to the suitors, men full of
outrage [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hubris</foreign>]. She knew of the plot against
Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard
their counsels and had told her; she went down
therefore to the court attended by her maidens,
and when she reached the suitors [415] she stood
by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of
the hall holding a veil before her face, and
rebuked Antinoos saying:</p>
<p n="653" start-line="16.418" end-line="16.433">“Antinoos, full of outrage [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>], wicked schemer,
they say you are the best speaker and counselor
[420] of any man your own age in the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
Ithaca, but you are nothing of the kind. Madman,
why should you try to compass the death of
Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose
witness is Zeus himself? It is not right for you
to plot thus against one another. Do you not
remember how your father fled to this house [425]
in fear of the people [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], who were enraged against him
for having gone with some Taphian pirates and
plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with
us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up
everything he had, but [430] Odysseus stayed their
hands although they were infuriated, and now you
devour his property without paying for it, and
break my heart by wooing his wife and trying to
kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the
others also.”</p>
<p n="654" start-line="16.434" end-line="16.448">To this Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, answered,
[435] “Take heart, circumspect Queen Penelope
daughter of Ikarios, and do not trouble yourself
about these matters. The man is not yet born, nor
never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son
Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face
of the earth. [440] I say—and it shall surely
be—that my spear shall be reddened with his blood;
for many a time has Odysseus taken me on his
knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put
pieces of meat into my hands. Therefore [445]
Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and
has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors.
Of course, if death comes to him from the gods, he
cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her, but
in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.</p>
<p n="655" start-line="16.449" end-line="16.459">Then Penelope went upstairs again [450] and
mourned her husband till owl-vision goddess Athena
shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaios
got back to Odysseus and his son, who had just
sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were
ready; helping one another to get supper ready;
Athena therefore [455] came up to Odysseus, son of
Laertes, turned him into an old man with a stroke
of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes
again, for fear that the swineherd might recognize
him and not keep the secret, but go and tell
circumspect Penelope.</p>
<p n="656" start-line="16.460" end-line="16.463">[460] Telemachus was the first to speak. “So
you have got back, Eumaios,” said he. “What is the
news [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] of
the town? Have the suitors returned, or are they
still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way
home?”</p>
<p n="657" start-line="16.464" end-line="16.475">[465] “I did not think of asking about that,”
replied Eumaios, “when I was in the town. I
thought I would give my message and come back as
soon as I could. I met a man sent by those who had
gone with you to Pylos, and he was the first to
tell the news to your mother, [470] but I can say
what I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to
the crest of the hill of Hermes above the town
when I saw a ship coming into harbor with a number
of men in her. They had many shields and spears,
[475] and I thought it was the suitors, but I
cannot be sure.”</p>
<p n="658" start-line="16.476" end-line="16.477">On hearing this Telemachus, the hallowed
prince, smiled to his father, but so that Eumaios
could not see him.</p>
<p n="659" start-line="16.478" end-line="16.481">Then, when they had finished their labor
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] and the
meal was ready, they ate it, and every man had his
full share so that all were satisfied. [480] As
soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they
laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of
sleep.</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 17</head>
<p n="660" start-line="17.1" end-line="17.15" rend="no-indent">When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus, beloved
son of godlike Odysseus, bound on his sandals and
took a strong spear that suited his hands, [5] for
he wanted to go into the city. “Old friend,” said
he to the swineherd, “I will now go to the town
and show myself to my mother, for she will never
leave off grieving till she has seen me. [10] As
for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the
town and let him beg there of any one who will
give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have
trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened
with other people. If this makes him angry [15] so
much the worse for him, but I like to tell what is
true [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>alēthēs</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="661" start-line="17.16" end-line="17.25">Then resourceful Odysseus said, “Sir, I do not
want to stay here; a beggar can always do better
in town than country, for anyone who likes can
give him something. [20] I am too old to care
about remaining here at the beck and call of a
master. Therefore let this man do as you have just
told him, and take me to the town as soon as I
have had a warm by the fire, and the day has got a
little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin,
[25] and this frosty morning I shall be perished
with cold, for you say the city is some way
off.”</p>
<p n="662" start-line="17.26" end-line="17.30">Then Telemachus strode off through the yards,
brooding his revenge upon the suitors. When he
reached home he stood his spear against a
bearing-post of the hall, crossed the stone floor
of the hall itself, [30] and went inside.</p>
<p n="663" start-line="17.31" end-line="17.44">Nurse Eurykleia saw him long before any one
else did. She was putting the fleeces on to the
seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to
him; all the other maids of patient-hearted
Odysseus came up too, [35] and covered his head
and shoulders with their kisses. Circumspect
Penelope came out of her room looking like Artemis
or golden Aphrodite, and wept as she flung her
arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and
both his beautiful eyes, [40] “Light of my eyes,”
she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are
come home again; I was sure I was never going to
see you any more. To think of your having gone off
to Pylos without saying anything about it or
obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what you
saw.”</p>
<p n="664" start-line="17.45" end-line="17.56">[45] “Do not scold me, mother,’ answered the
spirited Telemachus, “nor vex me, seeing what a
narrow escape I have had, but wash your face,
change your dress, go upstairs with your [50]
maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs
to all the gods if Zeus will only grant us our
revenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the
place of assembly to invite a stranger who has
come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with
my crew, [55] and told Piraios to take him home
and look after him till I could come for him
myself.”</p>
<p n="665" start-line="17.57" end-line="17.60">She heeded her son’s words, washed her face,
changed her dress, and vowed full and sufficient
hecatombs to all the gods [60] if they would only
grant her revenge upon the suitors.</p>
<p n="666" start-line="17.61" end-line="17.70">Telemachus went through, and out of, the halls
spear in hand—not alone, for his two fleet dogs
went with him. Athena endowed him with a presence
of such divine comeliness [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] that all
marveled at him as he went by, [65] and the
suitors gathered round him with fair words in
their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he
avoided them, and went to sit with Mentor,
Antiphos, and Halitherses, old friends of his
father’s house, [70] and they made him tell them
all that had happened to him. Then Piraios came up
with Theoklymenos, whom he had escorted through
the town to the place of assembly, whereon
Telemachus at once joined them. Piraios was first
to speak: [75] “Telemachus,” said he, “I wish you
would send some of your women to my house to take
away the presents Menelaos gave you.”</p>
<p n="667" start-line="17.71" end-line="17.83">“We do not know, Piraios,” answered the
spirited Telemachus, “what may happen. If the
suitors kill me in my own house [80] and divide my
property among them, I would rather you had the
presents than that any of those people should get
hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to
kill them, I shall be much obliged if you will
kindly bring me my presents.”</p>
<p n="668" start-line="17.84" end-line="17.100">With these words he took Theoklymenos to [85]
his own house. When they got there they laid their
cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the
baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had
washed and anointed them, and had given them
cloaks and khitons, [90] they took their seats at
table. A maid servant then brought them water in a
beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver
basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a
clean table beside them. An upper servant brought
them bread [95] and offered them many good things
of what there was in the house. Opposite them sat
Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the
bearing-posts of the hall, and spinning. Then they
laid their hands on the good things that were
before them, and as soon as they had had enough to
eat and drink [100] circumspect Penelope said:</p>
<p n="669" start-line="17.101" end-line="17.106">“Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down
on that sad couch, which I have not ceased to
water with my tears, from the day Odysseus set out
for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed,
however, to make it clear to me [105] before the
suitors came back to the house, whether or not you
had been able to hear anything about the return
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] of
your father.”</p>
<p n="670" start-line="17.107" end-line="17.149">“I will tell you then the truth [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alētheia</foreign>],” replied her
spirited son. “We went to Pylos and saw Nestor,
shepherd of the people, [110] who took me to his
house and treated me as hospitably as though I
were a son of his own who had just returned after
a long absence; so also did his sons; but he said
he had not heard a word from any human being about
enduring Odysseus, [115] whether he was alive or
dead. He sent me, therefore, with a chariot and
horses to Atreus’s son, spear-famed Menelaos.
There I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both
Argives and Trojans, were in the gods’ wisdom
doomed to suffer. Menelaos [120] asked me what it
was that had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told
him the whole truth [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>alētheia</foreign>], whereon he said, ‘So, then,
these cowards would usurp [125] a brave man’s bed?
A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the
lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the
forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he
comes back to his lair, [130] will make short work
of the pair of them, and so will Odysseus with
these suitors. By Father Zeus, Athena, and
Apollo, <seg rend="subscript">133</seg> being such
a man as the one who [i.e. Odysseus], in
well-founded Lesbos, <seg rend="subscript"
>134</seg> in rivalry stood up and wrestled
Philomeleides [135] and threw him down mightily,
and all the Achaeans were glad —if he is still
such, and were to come near these suitors, they
would have a swift doom and a sorry wedding. As
regards your question, however, I will not
prevaricate nor deceive you, [140] but what the
ever-truthful old man of the sea told me, so much
will I tell you in full. He said he could see
Odysseus on an island sorrowing bitterly in the
house of the nymph Kalypsō, who was keeping him
prisoner, and he could not reach his home, [145]
for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over
the sea.’ This was what Atreus’s son, spear-famed
Menelaos told me, and when I had heard his story I
came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and
soon brought me safe home again.”</p>
<p n="671" start-line="17.150" end-line="17.151">[150] With these words he moved the heart of
Penelope. Then Theoklymenos said to her:</p>
<p n="672" start-line="17.152" end-line="17.161">“Madam, respected wife of Odysseus, son of
Laertes, Telemachus, a godlike man, does not
understand these things; listen therefore to me,
for I can divine them surely, and will hide
nothing from you. [155] May Zeus, the king of the
skies, be my witness, and the rites of
hospitality, with that hearth of Odysseus to which
I now come, that blameless Odysseus himself is
even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the
country or staying in one place, is inquiring into
all these evil deeds and preparing a day of
reckoning for the suitors. [160] I saw an omen
when I was on the ship which meant this, and I
told Telemachus about it.”</p>
<p n="673" start-line="17.162" end-line="17.165">“May it be even so,” answered circumspect
Penelope; “if your words come true, you shall have
such gifts and such good will [165] from me that
all who see you shall congratulate you.”</p>
<p n="674" start-line="17.166" end-line="17.176">Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors
were throwing discs, or aiming with spears at a
mark on the leveled ground in front of the house,
and behaving with all their old insolence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>]. [170]
But when it was now time for dinner, and the flock
of sheep and goats had come into the town from all
the country round, with their shepherds as usual,
then Medon, who was their favorite servant, and
who waited upon them at table, said, “Now then, my
young masters, you have had enough sport [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], [175] so come
inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not
a bad thing, when it is time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] for dinner.”</p>
<p n="675" start-line="17.177" end-line="17.191">They left their sports as he told them, and
when they were within the house, they laid their
cloaks on the benches and seats inside, [180] and
then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a
heifer, all of them fat and well grown. Thus they
made ready for their meal. In the meantime
Odysseus and the swineherd were about starting for
the town, and the swineherd said, [185] “Stranger,
I suppose you still want to go to town to-day, as
my master said you were to do; for my own part I
should have liked you to stay here as a station
hand, but I must do as my master tells me, or he
will scold me later on, and a scolding from one’s
master is a very serious thing. [190] Let us then
be off, for it is now broad day; it will be night
again directly and then you will find it
colder.”</p>
<p n="676" start-line="17.192" end-line="17.196">“I know and understand you,” replied
resourceful Odysseus; “you need say no more. Let
us be going, [195] but if you have a stick ready
cut, let me have it to walk with, for you say the
road is a very rough one.”</p>
<p n="677" start-line="17.197" end-line="17.216">As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered
wallet over his shoulders, by the cord from which
it hung, and Eumaios gave him a stick to his
liking. [200] The two then started, leaving the
station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen who
remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his
master followed after, looking like some
broken-down old tramp as he leaned upon his staff,
and his clothes were all in rags. When they had
got over the rough steep ground [205] and were
nearing the city, they reached the fountain from
which the townspeople drew their water. This had
been made by Ithacus, Neritos, and Polyktor. There
was a grove of water-loving poplars planted in a
circle all round it, [210] and the clear cold
water came down to it from a rock high up, while
above the fountain there was an altar to the
nymphs, at which all wayfarers used to sacrifice.
Here Melanthios, son of Dolios, overtook them as
he was driving down some goats, the best in his
flock, for the suitors’ dinner, and there were two
shepherds with him. [215] When he saw Eumaios and
Odysseus he reviled them with outrageous and
unseemly language, which made Odysseus very
angry.</p>
<p n="678" start-line="17.217" end-line="17.232">“There you go,” cried he, “and a precious pair
you are. See how the gods bring birds of the same
feather to one another. Where, pray, master
swineherd, are you taking this poor [220]
miserable object? It would make any one sick to
see such a creature at table. A person like this
never won a prize for anything in his life, but
will go about rubbing his shoulders against every
man’s door post, and begging, not for swords and
cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps
not worth begging for. If you would give him to me
for a hand on my station, [225] he might do to
clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed
to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as
much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to
bad ways and will not go about any kind of work;
he will do nothing but beg victuals all over the
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], to feed his insatiable belly. I
say, therefore, and it shall surely be— [230] if
he goes near godlike Odysseus’ house he will get
his head broken by the stools they will fling at
him, till they turn him out.”</p>
<p n="679" start-line="17.233" end-line="17.239">Then, as he passed, he gave Odysseus a kick on
the hip out of pure wantonness, [235] but Odysseus
stood firm, and did not budge from the path. For a
moment he doubted whether or not to fly at
Melanthios and kill him with his staff, or fling
him to the ground and beat his brains out; he
resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself
in check, but the swineherd looked straight at
Melanthios and rebuked him, lifting up his hands
and praying to the gods as he did so.</p>
<p n="680" start-line="17.240" end-line="17.246">[240] “Fountain nymphs,” he cried, “children of
Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned you thigh bones
covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant
my prayer that a superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] may send him
home. He would soon put an end to the swaggering
threats with which such men as you go about
insulting people— [245] gadding all over the town
while your flocks are going to ruin through bad
shepherding.”</p>
<p n="681" start-line="17.247" end-line="17.253">Then Melanthios the goatherd answered, “You
ill-conditioned cur, what are you talking about?
Some day or other I will put you on board ship and
take you [250] to a foreign country, where I can
sell you and keep the wealth you will fetch. I
wish I were as sure that Apollo, silver-bowed,
would strike Telemachus dead this very day, or
that the suitors would kill him, as I am sure that
Odysseus will never come home again.”</p>
<p n="682" start-line="17.254" end-line="17.260">With this he left them to come on at their
leisure, [255] while he went quickly forward and
soon reached the house of his master. When he got
there he went in and took his seat among the
suitors opposite Eurymakhos, who liked him better
than any of the others. The servants brought him a
portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set
bread before him that he might eat. [260]
Presently Odysseus and the swineherd came up to
the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,
for Phemios was just beginning to sing to the
suitors. Then Odysseus took hold of the
swineherd’s hand, and said:</p>
<p n="683" start-line="17.260" end-line="17.271">“Eumaios, this house of Odysseus is a very fine
place. [265] No matter how far you go you will
find few like it. One building keeps following on
after another. The outer court has a wall with
battlements all round it; the doors are double
folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a
hard matter to take it by force of arms. I
perceive, too, that there are many people
banqueting within it, [270] for there is a smell
of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which
the gods have made to go along with feasting.”</p>
<p n="684" start-line="17.272" end-line="17.279">Then Eumaios said, “You have perceived aright,
as indeed you generally do; but let us think what
will be our best course. [275] Will you go inside
first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind
you, or will you wait here and let me go in first?
But do not wait long, or some one may see you
loitering about outside, and throw something at
you. Consider this matter I pray you.”</p>
<p n="685" start-line="17.280" end-line="17.289">[280] And much-enduring great Odysseus
answered, “I understand and heed. Go in first and
leave me here where I am. I am quite used to being
beaten and having things thrown at me. I have been
so much buffeted about [285] in war and by sea
that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with
the rest. But a man cannot hide away the cravings
of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives
much trouble to all men; it is because of this
that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to
make war upon other people.”</p>
<p n="686" start-line="17.290" end-line="17.305">[290] As they were thus talking, a dog that had
been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up
his ears. This was Argos, whom patient-hearted
Odysseus had bred before setting out for Troy, but
he had never had any work out of him. In the old
days he used to be taken out by the young men
[295] when they went hunting wild goats, or deer,
or hares, but now that his master was gone he was
lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung
that lay in front of the stable doors till the men
should come and draw it away to manure the great
field; [300] and he was full of fleas. As soon as
he saw Odysseus standing there, he dropped his
ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get
close up to his master. When Odysseus saw the dog
on the other side of the yard, [305] he dashed a
tear from his eyes without Eumaios seeing it, and
said:</p>
<p n="687" start-line="17.306" end-line="17.323">“Eumaios, what a noble hound that is over
yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid;
is he as fine as he looks, or is he only one of
those dogs that come begging about a table, [310]
and are kept merely for show?” “This hound,”
answered Eumaios, “belonged to him who has died in
a far country. If he were what he was when
Odysseus left for Troy, [315] he would soon show
you what he could do. There was not a wild beast
in the forest that could get away from him when he
was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on
evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and
the women take no care of him. [320] Servants
never do their work when their master’s hand is no
longer over them, for Zeus of the wide brows takes
half the goodness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>] out of a man when he makes a
slave of him.”</p>
<p n="688" start-line="17.324" end-line="17.327">As he spoke he went [325] inside the buildings
to the hall where the suitors were, but Argos died
as soon as he had recognized his master.</p>
<p n="689" start-line="17.328" end-line="17.335">Godlike Telemachus saw Eumaios long before any
one else did, and beckoned him [330] to come and
sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat
lying near where the carver sat serving out their
portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought
it to Telemachus’ table, and sat down opposite
him. Then the servant [335] brought him his
portion, and gave him bread from the
bread-basket.</p>
<p n="690" start-line="17.336" end-line="17.347">Immediately afterwards Odysseus came inside,
looking like a poor miserable old beggar, leaning
on his staff and with his clothes all in rags. He
sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood [340] just
inside the doors leading from the outer to the
inner court, and against a bearing-post of
cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfully
planed, and had made to join truly with rule and
line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the
bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold
in his two hands, and said to Eumaios, [345] “Take
this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round
of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must
not feel circumspection [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aidōs</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="691" start-line="17.348" end-line="17.352">So Eumaios went up to him and said, [350]
“Stranger, Telemachus sends you this, and says you
are to go the round of the suitors begging, for
beggars must not feel circumspection [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="692" start-line="17.353" end-line="17.373">Resourceful Odysseus answered, “May lord Zeus
grant all happiness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbos</foreign>] to Telemachus, [355] and fulfill
the desire of his heart.” Then with both hands he
took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it on
the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on
eating it while the bard was singing, and had just
finished his dinner as he left off. [360] The
suitors applauded the bard, whereon Athena went up
to Odysseus, son of Laertes, and prompted him to
beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors,
that he might see what kind of people they were,
and tell the good from the bad; [365] but come
what might she was not going to save a single one
of them. Odysseus, therefore, went on his round,
going from left to right, and stretched out his
hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some
of them pitied him, and were curious about him,
asking one another who he was and where he came
from; whereon the goatherd Melanthios said, [370]
“Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you
something about him, for I have seen him before.
The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing
about the man himself, nor where he comes
from.”</p>
<p n="693" start-line="17.374" end-line="17.379">Then Antinoos began to abuse the swineherd.
[375] “You precious idiot,” he cried, “what have
you brought this man to town for? Have we not
tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as
we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing that
such people gather here to waste your master’s
property and must you needs bring this man as
well?” [380] And Eumaios answered, <seg
rend="subscript">381</seg> “Antinoos! Though you
are noble, you do not speak properly. <seg
rend="subscript">382</seg>What man who is from
somewhere else himself <seg rend="subscript"
>383</seg> will invite yet another guest-stranger
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">xenos</foreign>], unless
he [the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">xenos</foreign>]
is one of those who are workers of the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], <seg
rend="subscript">384</seg>such as a seer [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>], or a healer of
illnesses, or a carpenter who works on wood, [385]
or even an inspired singer who can give delight
with his singing? <seg rend="subscript"
>386</seg> For such men are apt to be invited
anywhere in the world. <seg rend="subscript"
>387</seg> But one would not invite a beggar; such
a man would feed on his host. You are always
harder on Odysseus’ servants than any of the other
suitors are, and above all on me, but I [390] do
not care so long as godlike Telemachus and
circumspect Penelope are alive and here.”</p>
<p n="694" start-line="17.380" end-line="17.391">But the spirited Telemachus said, “Hush, do not
answer him; Antinoos has the bitterest tongue of
all the suitors, [395] and he makes the others
worse.”</p>
<p n="695" start-line="17.392" end-line="17.404">Then turning to Antinoos he said, “Antinoos,
you take as much care of my interests as though I
were your son. Why should you want to see this
stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid;
[400] take something and give it him yourself; I
do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my
mother, nor any of the other servants in the house
of godlike Odysseus; but I know you will not do
what I say, for you are more fond of eating things
yourself than of giving them to other people.”</p>
<p n="696" start-line="17.405" end-line="17.408">[405] “What do you mean, high-spoken
intemperate Telemachus,” replied Antinoos, “by
this swaggering talk? If all the suitors were to
give him as much as I will, he would not come here
again for another three months.”</p>
<p n="697" start-line="17.409" end-line="17.414">As he spoke he drew the stool [410] on which he
rested his dainty feet from under the table, and
made as though he would throw it at Odysseus, but
the other suitors all gave him something, and
filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was
about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and
eat what the suitors had given him, but he first
went up to Antinoos and said:</p>
<p n="698" start-line="17.415" end-line="17.444">[415] Give, friend! For you seem to be not the
worst of the Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript"
>416</seg> but the best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aristos</foreign>], since you seem like a king;
therefore you should be the better giver, and I
will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a
rich [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbios</foreign>]
man once, and had a fine house of my own; [420] in
those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now
am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted.
I had any number of servants, and all the other
things which people have who live well and are
accounted wealthy, but it pleased Zeus, son of
Kronos, to take all away from me. [425] He sent me
with a band of roving robbers to Egypt; it was a
long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my
ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay
by them and keep guard over them, [430] while I
sent out scouts to reconnoiter from every point of
vantage.</p>
<p n="699" start-line="17.445" end-line="17.452">But the men disobeyed my orders with insolence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>], took
to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the
Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives
and children captives. The alarm was soon carried
to the city, [435] and when they heard the
war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the
plain was filled with soldiers—horse and foot—and
with the gleam of armor. Then Zeus spread panic
among my men, and they would no longer face the
enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. [440]
The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest
alive to do forced labor for them; as for myself,
they gave me to a friend who met them, to take to
Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasos, who was a
great man in Cyprus. From there have I come here
in a state of great misery.”</p>
<p n="700" start-line="17.453" end-line="17.457">[445] Then Antinoos said, “What superhuman
force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>]
can have sent such a pestilence to plague us
during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of
the court, or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus
over again for your insolence and importunity;
[450] you have shamelessly begged of all the
others, and they have given you lavishly, for they
have abundance round them, and it is easy to be
free with other people’s property when there is
plenty of it.”</p>
<p n="701" start-line="17.458" end-line="17.465">Then resourceful Odysseus began to move off,
and said, “Your looks, my fine sir, are better
than your breeding; [455] if you were in your own
house you would not spare a poor man so much as a
pinch of salt, for though you are in another
man’s, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot
find it in you to give him even a piece of
bread.”</p>
<p n="702" start-line="17.466" end-line="17.476">This made Antinoos very angry, and he scowled
at him saying, [460] “You shall pay for this
before you get clear of the court.” With these
words he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on
the right shoulder-blade near the top of his back.
Odysseus stood firm as a rock and the blow did not
even stagger him, [465] but he shook his head in
silence as he brooded on his revenge. Then he went
back to the threshold and sat down there, laying
his well-filled wallet at his feet.</p>
<p n="703" start-line="17.477" end-line="17.480">“Listen to me,” he cried, “you suitors of
glorious Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as
I am minded. [470] A man knows neither ache
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] nor
pain [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]
if he gets hit while fighting for his wealth, or
for his sheep or his cattle; and even so Antinoos
has hit me while in the service of my miserable
belly, which is always getting people into
trouble. Still, [475] if the poor have gods and
avenging deities at all, I pray them that
Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, may come to a bad end
before his marriage.”</p>
<p n="704" start-line="17.481" end-line="17.487">“Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in
silence, or be off elsewhere,” shouted Antinoos.
“If you say more I will have you dragged [480]
hand and foot through the courts, and the servants
shall flay you alive.”</p>
<p n="705" start-line="17.488" end-line="17.491">The other suitors were much displeased at this,
and one of the young men said, “Antinoos, you did
ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it
will be worse for you if he should turn out to be
some god— [485] and we know the gods go about
disguised in all sorts of ways as people from
foreign countries, and travel about the world to
see who do things of outrage [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>] and who do
things of righteousness.”</p>
<p n="706" start-line="17.492" end-line="17.504">Thus said the suitors, but Antinoos paid them
no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus felt much grief
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] [490]
about the blow that had been given to his father,
and though no tear fell from him, he shook his
head in silence and brooded on his revenge.</p>
<p n="707" start-line="17.505" end-line="17.511">Now when circumspect Penelope heard that the
beggar had been struck in the banqueting-hall, she
said before her maids, “Would that Apollo would so
strike you, Antinoos,” [495] and her waiting
woman, Eurynome, answered, “If our prayers were
answered not one of the suitors would ever again
see the sun rise.” Then circumspect Penelope said,
“Nurse, every single one of them is hateful
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ekhthroi</foreign>] to
me, for they mean nothing but mischief, [500] but
I hate Antinoos like the darkness of death itself.
A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about
the house for sheer want. Every one else has given
him something to put in his wallet, but Antinoos
has hit him on the right shoulder-blade with a
footstool.”</p>
<p n="708" start-line="17.512" end-line="17.527">[505] Thus did she talk with her maids as she
sat in her own room, and in the meantime great
Odysseus was getting his dinner. Then she called
for the swineherd and said, “Noble Eumaios, go and
tell the stranger to come here, I want to see him
[510] and ask him some questions. He seems to have
traveled much, and he may have seen or heard
something of my unhappy husband.”</p>
<p n="709" start-line="17.528" end-line="17.540">To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios, “If
these Achaeans, Madam, would only keep quiet, <seg
rend="subscript">514</seg> the kind of things he
tells about—it would put your heart in a trance.
[515] I had him three days and three nights with
me in my hut, which was the first place he reached
after running away from his ship, and he has not
yet completed the story of his misfortunes. <seg
rend="subscript">518</seg> As when a man is
looking at a singer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aoiodos</foreign>] who has learned his words from
the gods <seg rend="subscript">519</seg> and the
words give pleasure to mortals, [520] who yearn to
hear him without pause when he sings— <seg
rend="subscript">521</seg> so also that one was
putting a trance on me as he sat in my house. He
says there is an old friendship between his house
and that of Odysseus, and that he comes from Crete
where the descendants of Minos live, after having
been driven here and there by every kind of
misfortune; [525] he also declares that he has
heard of Odysseus as being alive and near at hand
in the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of the Thesprotians, and that he
is bringing great wealth home with him.”</p>
<p n="710" start-line="17.541" end-line="17.550">“Call him here, then,” said Penelope, “that I
too may hear his story. [530] As for the suitors,
let them take their pleasure indoors or out as
they will, for they have nothing to fret about.
Their wheat and wine remain unwasted in their
houses with none but servants to consume them,
while they keep hanging about our house day after
day [535] sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat
goats for their banquets, and never giving so much
as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.
No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have
now no Odysseus to protect us. If he were to come
again, [540] he and his son would soon have a
revenge full of violence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="711" start-line="17.551" end-line="17.559">As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that
the whole house resounded with it. Penelope
laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaios,
“Go and call the stranger; [545] did you not hear
how my son sneezed just as I was speaking? This
can only mean that all the suitors are going to be
killed, and that not one of them shall escape.
Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your
heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is
speaking the truth [550] I shall give him a khiton
and cloak of good wear.”</p>
<p n="712" start-line="17.560" end-line="17.573">When Eumaios heard this he went straight to
Odysseus and said, “Father stranger, my mistress
circumspect Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has
sent for you; she is in great grief, but she
wishes to hear anything [555] you can tell her
about her husband, and if she is satisfied that
you are speaking the truth, she will give you a
khiton and cloak, which are the very things that
you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get
enough of that to fill your belly, by begging
about the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>, and letting those give that
will.”</p>
<p n="713" start-line="17.574" end-line="17.578">[560] “I will tell the daughter of Ikarios,
circumspect Penelope,” answered much-enduring
great Odysseus, “nothing but what is strictly
true. I know all about her husband, and have been
partner with him in affliction, but I am afraid of
passing through this crowd of cruel suitors, [565]
for their overweening pride [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>] and violent
insolence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>]
reach the sky. Just now, moreover, as I was going
about the house without doing any harm, a man gave
me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither
Telemachus nor any one else defended me. Tell
Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait [570]
till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to
the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin—you
know they are, for you have seen them ever since I
first asked you to help me—she can then ask me
about the return of her husband.”</p>
<p n="714" start-line="17.579" end-line="17.584">The swineherd went back when he heard this,
[575] and Penelope said as she saw him cross the
threshold, “Why do you not bring him here,
Eumaios? Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat
him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at
all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.”</p>
<p n="715" start-line="17.585" end-line="17.588">To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios,
[580] “The stranger is quite reasonable. He is
avoiding the suitors, men full of outrageousness
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>], and
is only doing what any one else would do. He asks
you to wait till sundown, and it will be much
better, madam, that you should have him all to
yourself, when you can hear him and talk to him as
you will.”</p>
<p n="716" start-line="17.589" end-line="17.597">[585] “The man is no fool,” answered
circumspect Penelope, “it would very likely be as
he says, for there are no such abominable people
in the whole world as these men are.”</p>
<p n="717" start-line="17.598" end-line="17.601">When she had done speaking Eumaios went back
[590] to the suitors, for he had explained
everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said
in his ear so that none could overhear him, “My
dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs, to see
after your property and my own business. You will
look to what is going on [595] here, but above all
be careful to keep out of danger, for there are
many who bear you ill will. May Zeus bring them to
a bad end before they do us a mischief.”</p>
<p n="718" start-line="17.602" end-line="17.606">“Very well,” replied the spirited Telemachus,
“go home when you have had your dinner, [600] and
in the morning come here with the victims we are
to sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to the
gods and me.”</p>
<p n="719">Then Eumaios took his seat again, and when he
had finished his dinner he left the courts and the
hall [605] with the men at table, and went back to
his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began
to amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for
it was now getting on towards evening.</p>

only I do not like to do so? Get up then, and go
of yourself, or we shall come to blows.”</p>
<p n="722" start-line="18.14" end-line="18.24">Resourceful Odysseus frowned on him and
said, [15] “You <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimonios</foreign>! I am harming you by neither
deed nor word. <seg rend="subscript">16</seg> And
I do not begrudge [I have no <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">phthonos</foreign>] that someone
should be a giver, after having been a taker in
great quantities. <seg rend="subscript"
>17</seg> But this threshold will accommodate both
of us, and you should not <seg rend="subscript"
>18</seg> have <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>phthonos</foreign> about the property of others.
You seem to be a beggar like me, <seg
rend="subscript">19</seg> and it is the gods who
are likely to grant prosperity [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>]. [20] Do not,
however, talk too much about fighting or you will
incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover
your mouth and chest with blood. I shall have more
serenity [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hēsukhiā</foreign>] tomorrow if I do, for you
will not come to the house of Odysseus, son of
Laertes, any more.”</p>
<p n="723" start-line="18.25" end-line="18.31">[25] Iros was very angry and answered, “You
filthy glutton, you run on like an old fish-hag. I
have a good mind to lay both hands about you, and
knock your teeth out of your head [30] like so
many boar’s tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let
these people here stand by and look on. You will
never be able to fight one who is so much younger
than yourself.”</p>
<p n="724" start-line="18.32" end-line="18.39">Thus roundly did they rate one another on the
smooth pavement in front of the doorway, and when
Antinoos, the sacred prince, saw what was going on
[35] he laughed heartily and said to the others,
“This is the finest sport that you ever saw; the
gods never yet sent anything like it into this
house. The stranger and Iros have quarreled and
are going to fight, let us set them on to do so at
once.”</p>
<p n="725" start-line="18.40" end-line="18.49">[40] The suitors all came up laughing, and
gathered round the two ragged tramps. “Listen to
me,” said Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, “there are
some goats’ paunches down at the fire, which we
have filled [45] with blood and fat, and set aside
for supper; he who is victorious and proves
himself to be the better man shall have his pick
of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we
will not allow any other beggar about the house at
all.”</p>
<p n="726" start-line="18.50" end-line="18.57">[50] The others all agreed, but resourceful
Odysseus, to throw them off the scent, said,
“Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with
suffering, cannot hold his own against a young
one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on,
though I know it can only end in my getting a
drubbing. [55] You must swear, however that none
of you will give me a foul blow to favor Iros and
secure him the victory.”</p>
<p n="727" start-line="18.58" end-line="18.65">They swore as he told them, and when they had
completed their oath [60] The hallowed prince
Telemachus put in a word and said, “Stranger, if
your heart and bold spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] urges you to
settle with this, you need not be afraid of any
one here. Whoever strikes you will have to fight
more than one. I am host, [65] and the other
chiefs, Antinoos and Eurymakhos, both of them men
of understanding, are of the same mind as I
am.”</p>
<p n="728" start-line="18.66" end-line="18.74">Every one assented, and Odysseus girded his old
rags about his loins, thus baring his stalwart
thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his
mighty arms; but Athena [70] came up to him and
made his limbs even stronger still. The suitors
were beyond measure astonished, and one would turn
towards his neighbor saying, “The stranger has
brought such a thigh out of his old rags that
there will soon be nothing left of Iros.”</p>
<p n="729" start-line="18.75" end-line="18.87">[75] Iros began to be very uneasy as he heard
them, but the servants girded him by force, and
brought him into the open part of the court in
such a fright that his limbs were all of a
tremble. Antinoos scolded him and said, “You
swaggering bully, [80] you ought never to have
been born at all if you are afraid of such an old
broken-down creature as this tramp is. I say,
therefore—and it shall surely be—if he beats you
and proves himself the better man, I shall pack
you off on board ship to the mainland and send you
[85] to King Ekhetos, who kills every one that
comes near him. He will cut off your nose and
ears, and draw out your entrails for the dogs to
eat.”</p>
<p n="730" start-line="18.88" end-line="18.107">This frightened Iros still more, but they
brought him into the middle of the court, and the
two men raised their hands to fight. [90] Then
much-enduring great Odysseus considered whether he
should let drive so hard at Iros as to make
his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē </foreign>leave him there and then as he
fell, or whether he should give him a lighter blow
that should only knock him down; in the end he
thought it best to give the lighter blow for fear
the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he was.
[95] Then they began to fight, and Iros hit
Odysseus on the right shoulder; but Odysseus gave
Iros a blow on the neck under the ear that broke
in the bones of his skull, and the blood came
gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the
dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on the
ground, but the suitors [100] threw up their hands
and nearly died of laughter, as Odysseus caught
hold of him by the foot and dragged him into the
outer court as far as the gate-house. There he
propped him up against the wall and put his staff
in his hands. [105] “Sit here,” said he, “and keep
the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature,
and if you try to make yourself king of the
beggars any more you shall fare still worse.”</p>
<p n="731" start-line="18.108" end-line="18.116">Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all
tattered and torn, over his shoulder with the cord
by which it hung, [110] and went back to sit down
upon the threshold; but the suitors went within
the halls, laughing and saluting him, “May Zeus,
and all the other gods,” said they, “grant you
whatever you want for having put an end to the
importunity of this insatiable tramp. [115] We
will take him over to the mainland presently, to
King Ekhetos, who kills every one that comes near
him.”</p>
<p n="732" start-line="18.117" end-line="18.123">Great Odysseus hailed this as of good omen, and
Antinoos set a great goat’s paunch before him
filled with blood and fat. Amphinomos took [120]
two loaves out of the bread-basket and brought
them to him, pledging him as he did so in a golden
goblet of wine. “Good luck to you,” he said,
“father stranger, you are very badly off at
present, but I hope you will have better fortune
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>] by and
by.”</p>
<p n="733" start-line="18.124" end-line="18.150">To this resourceful Odysseus answered, [125]
“Amphinomos, you seem to be a man of good
understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing
whose son you are. I have heard good reports
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] about
your father; he is Nisos of Doulikhion, a man both
brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son,
and you appear to be a considerable person;
listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am
saying. [130] Man is the vainest of all creatures
that have their being upon earth. As long as the
gods grant him excellence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] and his knees are
steady, he thinks that he shall come to no harm
hereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring
sorrow upon him, [135] he bears it as he needs
must, and makes the best of it; for the father of
gods and men gives men their daily minds [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] day by day. I know
all about it, for I was a rich [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">olbios</foreign>] man once, and
did much wrong in the stubbornness [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] of my pride, [140]
and in the confidence that my father and my
brothers would support me; therefore let a man be
pious in all things always, and take the good that
the gods may see fit to send him without
vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these
suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the
estate, and doing dishonor to the wife, [145] of
one who is certain to return some day, and that,
too, not long hence. I tell you, he will be here
soon; may a superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] send you home
quietly first that you may not meet with him in
the day of his coming, for once he is here [150]
the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.”</p>
<p n="734" start-line="18.151" end-line="18.157">With these words he made a drink-offering, and
when he had drunk he put the gold cup again into
the hands of Amphinomos, who walked away serious
and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. [155]
But even so he did not escape destruction, for
Athena had doomed him to fall by the hand of
Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place
from which he had come.</p>
<p n="735" start-line="18.158" end-line="18.168">Then the owl-vision goddess Athena put it into
the mind of circumspect Penelope [160] to show
herself to the suitors, that she might make them
still more enamored of her, and win still further
honor from her son and husband. So she feigned a
mocking laugh and said, “Eurynome, I have changed
my mind [165] and have a fancy to show myself to
the suitors although I detest them. I should like
also to give my son a hint that he had better not
have anything more to do with them. They speak
fairly enough but they mean mischief.”</p>
<p n="736" start-line="18.169" end-line="18.176">[170] “My dear child,” answered Eurynome, “all
that you have said is true, go and tell your son
about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your
face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered
with tears; it is not right that you should grieve
so incessantly; [175] for Telemachus, whom you
always prayed that you might live to see with a
beard, is already grown up.”</p>
<p n="737" start-line="18.177" end-line="18.184">“I know, Eurynome,” replied circumspect
Penelope, “that you mean well, but do not try and
persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, [180]
for the gods robbed me of all my beauty on the day
my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell Autonoe and
Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me
when I am in the hall; I am not going among the
men alone; it would not be proper for me to do
so.”</p>
<p n="738" start-line="18.185" end-line="18.199">[185] Then the old woman went out of the room
to bid the maids go to their mistress. In the
meantime the owl-vision goddess Athena turned her
thoughts to another matter, and sent Penelope,
daughter of Ikarios, off into a sweet slumber; so
she lay down on her couch and her limbs became
heavy with sleep. [190] Then the goddess shed
grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans
might admire her. She washed her face with the
ambrosial loveliness that Aphrodite wears when she
goes to the dance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>khoros</foreign>] with the Graces; [195] she made
her taller and of a more commanding figure, while
as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn
ivory. When Athena had done all this she went
away, whereon the maids came in from the women’s
room and woke Penelope with the sound of their
talking.</p>
<p n="739" start-line="18.200" end-line="18.205">[200] “What an exquisitely delicious sleep I
have been having,” said she, as she passed her
hands over her face, “in spite of all my misery. I
wish Artemis would let me die so sweetly now at
this very moment, that I might no longer waste in
despair for the loss of my dear husband, who
possessed [205] every kind of good quality
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] and was
the most distinguished man among the
Achaeans.”</p>
<p n="740" start-line="18.206" end-line="18.213">With these words she came down from her upper
room, not alone but attended by two of her
maidens, and when she, shining among women,
reached the suitors she stood by one of the
bearing-posts supporting the roof of the hall,
[210] holding a veil before her face, and with a
staid maid servant on either side of her. As they
beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and
became so desperately enamored of her, that each
one prayed he might win her for his own
bedmate.</p>
<p n="741" start-line="18.214" end-line="18.225">[215] “Telemachus,” said she, addressing her
beloved son, “I fear you are no longer so discreet
and well conducted as you used to be. When you
were younger you had a subtler thoughtfulness
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>]; now,
however, that you are grown up, though a stranger
to look at you would take you for the son of a
well-to-do [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbios</foreign>] father as far as size and good
looks go, [220] your conduct is by no means what
it should be. What is all this disturbance that
has been going on, and how came you to allow a
stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What
would have happened if he had suffered serious
injury while a suppliant in our house? [225]
Surely this would have been very discreditable to
you.”</p>
<p n="742" start-line="18.226" end-line="18.242">“I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your
displeasure,” replied the spirited Telemachus, “I
understand all about it and know when things are
not as they should be, which I could not do when I
was younger; [230] I cannot, however, behave with
perfect propriety at all times. First one and then
another of these wicked people here keeps driving
me out of my mind, and I have no one to stand by
me. After all, however, this fight between Iros
and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors
meant it to do, for the stranger got the best of
it. [235] I wish Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo
would break the neck of every one of these wooers
of yours, some inside the house and some out; and
I wish they might all be as limp as Iros is over
yonder in the gate of the outer court. [240] See
how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has
had such a thrashing that he cannot stand on his
feet nor achieve a homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], wherever that
may be, for has no strength left in him.”</p>
<p n="743" start-line="18.243" end-line="18.280">Thus did they converse. Eurymakhos then came up
and said, [245] “Circumspect Queen Penelope,
daughter of Ikarios, if all the Achaeans in Iasian
Argos could see you at this moment, you would have
still more suitors in your house by tomorrow
morning, for you are the most admirable woman in
the whole world both as regards personal beauty
and strength of understanding.” [250] To this
circumspect Penelope replied, “Eurymakhos, the
gods robbed me of all my excellence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] whether of face
or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and
my dear husband with them. If he were to return
and look after my affairs, [255] I should both be
more respected [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign>] and show a better presence to
the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and
with the afflictions which a superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] has
seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it
all, and when he was leaving home he took my right
wrist in his hand—‘Wife,’ he said, ‘we shall not
all of us [260] come safe home from Troy, for the
Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They
are excellent also at fighting from chariots, and
nothing decides [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>krinein</foreign>] the issue of a fight sooner
than this. [265] I know not, therefore, whether
the gods will send me back to you, or whether I
may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime
do you look after things here. Take care of my
father and mother as at present, and even more so
during my absence, but when you see our son
growing a beard, then [270] marry whom you will,
and leave this your present home.’ This is what he
said and now it is all coming true. A night will
come when I shall have to yield myself to a
marriage which I detest, for Zeus has taken from
me all hope of happiness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbos</foreign>]. This further grief [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>], moreover, cuts
me to the very heart. [275] You suitors are not
wooing me after the custom [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign>] of my country.
When men are courting a woman who they think will
be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth,
and when they are each trying to win her for
himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to
feast the friends of the lady, and they make her
magnificent presents, [280] instead of eating up
other people’s property without paying for
it.”</p>
<p n="744" start-line="18.281" end-line="18.283">This was what she said, and much-enduring great
Odysseus was glad when he heard her trying to get
presents out of the suitors, and flattering them
with fair words which he knew she did not mean in
her mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>].</p>
<p n="745" start-line="18.284" end-line="18.289">Then Antinoos said, [285] “Circumspect Queen
Penelope, daughter of Ikarios, take as many
presents as you please from any one who will give
them to you; it is not well to refuse a present;
but we will not go about our business nor stir
from where we are, till you have married the best
man among us, whoever he may be.”</p>
<p n="746" start-line="18.290" end-line="18.301">[290] The others applauded what Antinoos had
said, and each one sent his servant to bring his
present. Antinoos’ man returned with a large and
lovely dress most exquisitely pattern-woven. It
had twelve beautifully made brooch pins of pure
gold with which to fasten it. [295] Eurymakhos
immediately brought her a magnificent chain of
gold and amber beads that gleamed like sunlight.
Eurydamas’ two men returned with some earrings
fashioned into three radiant pendants which
glistened in beauty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kharis</foreign>]; while King Peisandros, [300]
son of Polyktor, gave her a necklace of the rarest
workmanship, and every one else brought her a
beautiful present of some kind.</p>
<p n="747" start-line="18.302" end-line="18.312">Then the queen went back to her room upstairs,
and her maids brought the presents after her.
Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing,
[305] and stayed till evening came. They danced
and sang till it grew dark; they then brought in
three braziers to give light, and piled them up
with chopped firewood very well seasoned and dry,
[310] and they lit torches from them, which the
maids held up turn and turn about. Then
illustrious resourceful Odysseus said:</p>
<p n="748" start-line="18.313" end-line="18.319">“Maids, servants of Odysseus who has so long
been absent, go to the queen inside the house;
[315] sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and
pick wool. I will hold the light for all these
people. They may stay till morning, but shall not
beat me, for I can stand a great deal.”</p>
<p n="749" start-line="18.320" end-line="18.325">[320] The maids looked at one another and
laughed, while pretty Melantho began to gibe at
him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolios,
but had been brought up by Penelope, who used to
give her toys to play with, and looked after her
when she was a child; but in spite of all this she
showed no consideration for the sorrows [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] of her
mistress, [325] and used to misconduct herself
with Eurymakhos, with whom she was in love.</p>
<p n="750" start-line="18.326" end-line="18.336">“Poor wretch,” said she, “are you gone clean
out of your mind? Go and sleep in some smithy, or
place of public gossips, instead of chattering
here. [330] Are you not ashamed of opening your
mouth before your betters—so many of them too? Has
the wine been getting into your head, or do you
always babble in this way? You seem to have lost
your wits because you beat the tramp Iros; take
care that a better man than he does not come [335]
and cudgel you about the head till he pack you
bleeding out of the house.”</p>
<p n="751" start-line="18.337" end-line="18.339">“Vixen,” replied resourceful Odysseus, scowling
at her, “I will go and tell Telemachus what you
have been saying, and he will have you torn limb
from limb.”</p>
<p n="752" start-line="18.340" end-line="18.345">[340] With these words he scared the women, and
they went off into the body of the house. They
trembled all over, for they thought he would do as
he said in a true [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>alēthēs</foreign>] way. But Odysseus took his
stand near the burning braziers, holding up
torches and looking at the people— [345] brooding
the while on things that should surely come to
pass.</p>
<p n="753" start-line="18.346" end-line="18.355">But Athena would not let the suitors for one
moment cease their insolence, for she wanted
Odysseus, son of Laertes, to become even more
bitter [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]
against them; she therefore set Eurymakhos, son of
Polybos, on [350] to gibe at him, which made the
others laugh. “Listen to me,” said he, “you
suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even
as I am minded. It is not for nothing that this
man has come to the house of Odysseus; I believe
the light has not been coming from the torches,
[355] but from his own head—for his hair is all
gone, every bit of it.”</p>
<p n="754" start-line="18.356" end-line="18.364">Then turning to Odysseus he said, “Stranger,
will you work as a servant, if I send you to the
moor and see that you are well paid? Can you build
a stone fence, or plant trees? [360] I will have
you fed all the year round, and will find you in
shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you;
for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to
work; you had rather fill your belly by going
round the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] begging.”</p>
<p n="755" start-line="18.365" end-line="18.386">[365] “Eurymakhos,” answered resourceful
Odysseus, “if you and I were to work one against
the other in the time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hōrā</foreign>] of early summer when the days are
at their longest—give me a good scythe, and take
another yourself, and let us see [370] which will
fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn
till dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if
you will plow against me, let us each take a yoke
of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength
and endurance: turn me into a four acre field,
[375] and see whether you or I can drive the
straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break
out this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears
and a helmet fitting well upon my temples—you
would find me foremost in the fray, [380] and
would cease your gibes about my belly. You are
insolent and your mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] is cruel, and you think yourself
a great man because you live in a little world,
and that a bad one. If Odysseus comes to his own
again, [385] the doors of his house are wide, but
you will find them narrow when you try to flee
through them.”</p>
<p n="756" start-line="18.387" end-line="18.404">Eurymakhos was furious at all this. He scowled
at him and cried, “You wretch, I will soon pay you
out [390] for daring to say such things to me, and
in public too. Has the wine been getting into your
head or do you always babble in this way? You seem
to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp
Iros.” With this he caught hold of a footstool,
but Odysseus [395] sought protection at the knees
of Amphinomos of Doulikhion, for he was afraid.
The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and
knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on
his back, and his wine-jug fell ringing to the
ground. The suitors in the covered hall were now
in an uproar, [400] and one would turn towards his
neighbor, saying, “I wish the stranger had gone
somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for all the
trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such
disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels
are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at
our banquet.”</p>
<p n="757" start-line="18.405" end-line="18.409">[405] Then the hallowed prince Telemachus came
forward and said, “Sirs, are you mad? Can you not
carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some
evil spirit has possessed you. I do not wish to
drive any of you away, but you have had your
suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the
better.”</p>
<p n="758" start-line="18.410" end-line="18.421">[410] The suitors bit their lips and marveled
at the boldness of his speech; but Amphinomos, the
son of Nisos, who was son to Aretias, said, “Do
not let us take offence; [415] it is reasonable
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>], so
let us make no answer. Neither let us do violence
to the stranger nor to any of godlike Odysseus’
servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the
drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home
to our rest. [420] As for the stranger, let us
leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to
his house that he has come.”</p>
<p n="759" start-line="18.422" end-line="18.428">Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them
well, so Moulios of Doulikhion, servant to
Amphinomos, mixed them a bowl of wine and water
[425] and handed it round to each of them man by
man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to
the blessed gods. Then, when they had made their
drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was
minded, they took their several ways each of them
to his own abode.</p>

<head>Rhapsody 19</head>
<p n="760" start-line="19.1" end-line="19.13" rend="no-indent">Great Odysseus was left in the
hall, pondering on the means whereby with Athena’s
help he might be able to kill the suitors.
Presently he said to Telemachus, “Telemachus, we
must get the armor together and take it [5] down
inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you
why you have removed it. Say that you have taken
it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as
it is no longer what it was when Odysseus went
away, but has become soiled and begrimed with
soot. [10] Add to this more particularly that you
are afraid a superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] may set them on
to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do
each other some harm which may disgrace both
banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms
sometimes tempts people to use them.”</p>
<p n="761" start-line="19.14" end-line="19.20">Telemachus approved of what his father had
said, [15] so he called nurse Eurykleia and said,
“Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I
take the armor that my father left behind him down
into the store room. No one looks after it now my
father is gone, and it has got all smirched with
soot during my own boyhood. [20] I want to take it
down where the smoke cannot reach it.”</p>
<p n="762" start-line="19.21" end-line="19.25">“I wish, child,” answered Eurykleia, “that you
would take the management of the house into your
own hands altogether, and look after all the
property yourself. But who is to go with you and
light you to the store room? [25] The maids would
have so, but you would not let them.”</p>
<p n="763" start-line="19.26" end-line="19.28">“The stranger,” said the spirited Telemachus,
“shall show me a light; when people eat my bread
they must earn it, no matter where they come
from.”</p>
<p n="764" start-line="19.29" end-line="19.40">Eurykleia did as she was told, [30] and bolted
the women inside their room. Then Odysseus and his
son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,
and spears inside; and Athena went before them
with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a soft and
brilliant radiance, [35] whereon Telemachus said,
“Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls,
with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on
which they rest are all aglow as with a flaming
fire. [40] Surely there is some god here who has
come down from the sky.”</p>
<p n="765" start-line="19.41" end-line="19.46">“Hush,” answered resourceful Odysseus, “hold
your thoughts [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>] in peace and ask no questions,
for this is the manner [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dikē</foreign>] of the gods. Get you to your bed,
and leave me here to talk [45] with your mother
and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask
me all sorts of questions.”</p>
<p n="766" start-line="19.47" end-line="19.52">Then Telemachus went by torch-light to the
other side of the inner court, to the room in
which he always slept. [50] There he lay in his
bed till morning, while Odysseus was left in the
hall pondering on the means whereby with Athena’s
help he might be able to kill the suitors.</p>
<p n="767" start-line="19.53" end-line="19.69">Then circumspect Penelope came down from her
room looking like golden Aphrodite or Artemis,
[55] and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls
of silver and ivory near the fire in her
accustomed place. It had been made by Ikmalios and
had a footstool all in one piece with the seat
itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on
this she [60] now sat, and the white-armed maids
came from the women’s room to join her. They set
about removing the tables at which the wicked
suitors had been dining, and took away the bread
that was left, with the cups from which they had
drunk. They emptied the embers out of the
braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give
both light and heat; [65] but Melantho began to
rail at Odysseus a second time and said,
“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging
about the house all night and spying upon the
women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your
supper there, or you shall be driven out with a
firebrand.”</p>
<p n="768" start-line="19.70" end-line="19.88">[70] Resourceful Odysseus scowled at her and
answered, “My good woman, why should you be so
angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and
my clothes are all in rags, and because I am
obliged to go begging about the <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign> after the manner
of tramps and beggars general? [75] I too was a
rich [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbios</foreign>]
man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those
days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no
matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had
any number of servants, and all the other things
which people have who live well and are accounted
wealthy, [80] but it pleased Zeus, son of Kronos,
to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware
lest you too come to lose that pride and place in
which you now wanton above your fellows; have a
care lest you get out of favor with your mistress,
and lest Odysseus should come home, for there is
still a chance that he may do so. [85] Moreover,
though he be dead as you think he is, yet by
Apollo’s will he has left a son behind him,
Telemachus, who will note anything done amiss by
the maids in the house, for he is now no longer in
his boyhood.”</p>
<p n="769" start-line="19.89" end-line="19.95">Circumspect Penelope heard what he was saying
[90] and scolded the maid, “Impudent baggage,”
said she, “I see how abominably you are behaving,
and you shall smart for it. You knew perfectly
well, for I told you myself, that I was going to
see the stranger and ask him [95] about my
husband, for whose sake I am in such continual
sorrow.”</p>
<p n="770" start-line="19.96" end-line="19.99">Then she said to her head waiting woman
Eurynome, “Bring a seat with a fleece upon it, for
the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,
and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask
him some questions.”</p>
<p n="771" start-line="19.100" end-line="19.105">[100] Eurynome brought the seat at once and set
a fleece upon it, and as soon as much-enduring
great Odysseus had sat down Penelope began by
saying, “Stranger, I shall first ask you [105] who
and whence are you? Tell me of your town and
parents.”</p>
<p n="772" start-line="19.106" end-line="19.122"><seg rend="subscript">107</seg> “My lady,”
answered resourceful Odysseus, “who among mortals
throughout the limitless stretches of earth <seg
rend="subscript">108</seg> would dare to quarrel
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">neikeîn</foreign>]
against you with words? For truly your glory
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] reaches
the wide firmament of the sky itself <seg
rend="subscript">109</seg> —like the glory of some
faultless king [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>basileus</foreign>], who, godlike as he is, [110]
and ruling over a population that is multitudinous
and vigorous, <seg rend="subscript"
>111</seg> upholds acts of good <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign> [= <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">eu-dikiai</foreign>], while the
dark earth produces <seg rend="subscript"
>112</seg> wheat and barley, the trees are loaded
with fruit, <seg rend="subscript">113</seg> the
ewes steadily bring forth lambs, and the sea
abounds with fish, <seg rend="subscript"
>114</seg> by reason of the good directions he
gives, and his people are meritorious [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretân</foreign>] under his rule.
[115] Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house,
ask me some other question and do not seek to know
my lineage and family, or you will recall memories
that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full
of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and
wailing in another person’s house, [120] nor is it
well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have
one of the servants or even yourself complaining
of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears
because I am heavy with wine.”</p>
<p n="773" start-line="19.123" end-line="19.163">Then circumspect Penelope answered, “Stranger,
the immortal gods robbed me of all excellence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>],
whether of face or figure, [125] when the Argives
set sail for Troy and my dear husband with them.
If he were to return and look after my affairs I
would have more fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kleos</foreign>] and would show a better presence
to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care,
and with the afflictions which a superhuman force
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] has
seen fit to heap upon me. [130] The chiefs from
all our islands—Doulikhion, Samē, and wooded
Zakynthos, as also from Ithaca itself, are wooing
me against my will and are wasting my estate. I
can therefore show no attention to strangers, nor
suppliants, [135] nor to people who say that they
are skilled artisans, but am all the time
brokenhearted about Odysseus. They want me to
marry again at once, and I have to invent
stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first
place a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] put it in my mind to set up a
great loom in my room, and to begin working upon
[140] an enormous fine web. Then I said to them,
‘Sweethearts, great Odysseus is indeed dead,
still, do not press me to marry again immediately;
wait—for I would not have my skill in needlework
perish unrecorded—till I have finished making a
shroud for the hero Laertes, to be ready [145]
against the time when death shall take him. He is
very rich, and the women of the district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] will talk if he
is laid out without a shroud.’ This was what I
said, and they assented; whereon I used to keep
working at my great web all day long, [150] but at
night I would undo it again by torch light. I
fooled them in this way for three years without
their finding it out, but as time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] wore on and I was
now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and
many days had been accomplished, those
good-for-nothing hussies my maids [155] betrayed
me to the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught
me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced
to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I
do not see how I can find any further shift for
getting out of this marriage. My parents are
putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes
at the ravages the suitors are making upon his
estate, [160] for he is now old enough to
understand all about it and is perfectly able to
look after his own affairs, for the gods have
blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still,
notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and
where you come from—for you must have had father
and mother of some sort; <seg rend="subscript"
>163</seg> for surely you are not from an oak, as
in the old stories, or from a rock.”</p>
<p n="774" start-line="19.164" end-line="19.202">Then resourceful Odysseus answered, [165] “My
Lady, wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, since you
persist in asking me about my family, I will
answer, no matter what it costs me: people must
expect to feel grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>akhos</foreign>] when they have been exiles as
long as I have, [170] and suffered as much among
as many peoples. Nevertheless, as regards your
question I will tell you all you ask. <seg
rend="subscript">172</seg> There’s a land called
Crete, in the middle of the sea that looks like
wine. <seg rend="subscript">173</seg> It’s
beautiful and fertile, surrounded by the waves,
and the people who live there <seg
rend="subscript">174</seg> are so many that you
can’t count them. They have ninety cities. [175]
Different people speak different languages, all
mixed together. <seg rend="subscript"
>176</seg> There are Eteo-Cretans, those
great-hearted ones. And Cydonians. <seg
rend="subscript">177</seg> There are Dorians, with
their three divisions, and luminous
Pelasgians. <seg rend="subscript">178</seg> In
this land [plural] is Knossos, a great city. There
it was that Minos, <seg rend="subscript"
>179</seg> who was renewed every nine years
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">enneōros</foreign>],
ruled as king. He was the companion [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">oaristēs</foreign>] of Zeus the
mighty. [180] And he was the father of my father,
Deukalion, the one with the big heart. <seg
rend="subscript">181</seg> Deukalion was my
father, and the father also of Idomeneus the
king. <seg rend="subscript">182</seg> That man [=
Idomeneus], in curved ships, went off to Ilion [=
Troy], <seg rend="subscript">183</seg> yes, he
went there together with the sons of Atreus [=
Agamemnon and Menelaos]. As for my name, which is
famous, it is Aithōn. <seg rend="subscript"
>184</seg> I’m the younger one by birth. As for
the other one [= Idomeneus], he was born before me
and is superior to me. [185] There [in Crete] is
where I [= Aithōn] saw Odysseus and gave him gifts
of guest-host friendship [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>xeniā</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
>186</seg> You see, he had been forced to land at
Crete by the violent power of a wind. <seg
rend="subscript">187</seg> He was trying to get to
Troy, but the wind detoured him as he was sailing
past the headlands of Maleiai, <seg
rend="subscript">188</seg> and he was dropped off
[by the violent wind] at Amnisos, exactly where
the cave of Eileithuia is situated. <seg
rend="subscript">189</seg> It was a harsh landing,
and he just barely avoided being destroyed by the
blasts of the sea-gales. [190] Right away he asked
to see Idomeneus as soon as he came to the city [=
Knossos]. <seg rend="subscript">191</seg> You see,
he was saying that he was a guest-friend [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">xenos</foreign>] [of Idomeneus]
and that they had a relationship of mutual
respect. <seg rend="subscript">192</seg> But it
was by now already the tenth or eleventh day since
he [= Idomeneus] <seg rend="subscript"
>193</seg> had departed, sailing off with a fleet
of curved ships on his way to Ilion [Troy] , so I
took him to my own house and showed him [195]
every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of
everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with
him with barley meal from the public store, and
got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to
sacrifice to their heart’s content. They stayed
with me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing
[200] from the North so strong that one could
hardly keep one’s feet on land. I suppose some
unfriendly superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] had raised it
for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind
dropped, and they got away.”</p>
<p n="775" start-line="19.203" end-line="19.219"><seg rend="subscript">203</seg> He made
likenesses [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>eïskein</foreign>], saying many deceptive
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pseudea</foreign>]
things looking like [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>homoia</foreign>] genuine [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">etuma</foreign>] things, and
Penelope wept as she listened, for her heart was
melted. [205] As the snow wastes upon the mountain
tops when the winds from South East and West have
breathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run
bank full with water, even so did her cheeks
overflow with tears for the husband who was all
the time sitting by her side. Odysseus [210] in
his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thūmos</foreign>] felt pity for her, but he kept
his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting
them so much as quiver, so cunningly did he
restrain his tears. Then, when she had relieved
herself by weeping, she turned to him again and
said: [215] “Now, stranger, I shall put you to the
test and see whether or not you really did
entertain my husband and his godlike men, as you
say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed,
what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also
with his companions.”</p>
<p n="776" start-line="19.220" end-line="19.248">[220] “My Lady,” answered resourceful Odysseus,
“it is such a long time ago that I can hardly say.
Twenty years are come and gone since he left my
home, and went elsewhere; but I will tell you as
well as I can recollect. [225] Great Odysseus wore
a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was
fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the
pin. On the face of this there was a device that
showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his
fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon
the ground. Every one marveled [230] at the way in
which these things had been done in gold, the dog
looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the
fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. <seg
rend="subscript">232</seg> And I noticed [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>] the tunic that he
wore next his skin; it was so soft that it fitted
him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in
the sunlight [235] to the admiration of all the
women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my
saying to your heart, that I do not know whether
Odysseus wore these clothes when he left home, or
whether one of his companions had given them to
him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some
one at whose house he was staying made him a
present of them, for he was a man of many friends
[240] and had few equals among the Achaeans. I
myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful
purple mantle, double lined, with a khiton that
went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his
ship with every mark of honor. He had a servant
with him, a little older than himself, [245] and I
can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were
hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair.
His name was Eurybates, and Odysseus treated him
with greater familiarity than he did any of the
others, as being the most like-minded with
himself.”</p>
<p n="777" start-line="19.249" end-line="19.260">Penelope was moved still more deeply [250] as
she heard the indisputable signs [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">sēmata</foreign>] that Odysseus
laid before her; and when she had again found
relief in tears she said to him, “Stranger, I was
already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you
shall be honored and made welcome in my house.
[255] It was I who gave Odysseus the clothes you
speak of. I took them out of the store room and
folded them up myself, and I gave him also the
gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall
never welcome him home again. It was by an ill
fate that he ever set out [260] for that detested
city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to
mention.”</p>
<p n="778" start-line="19.261" end-line="19.307">Then resourceful Odysseus answered, “My Lady,
wife of Odysseus, do not disfigure yourself
further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss,
though I can hardly blame you for doing so. [265]
A woman who has loved her husband and borne him
children, would naturally be grieved at losing
him, even though he were a worse man than
Odysseus, who they say was like a god. Still,
cease your tears and listen to what I can tell. I
will hide nothing from you, and can say with
perfect truth [270] that I have lately heard of
Odysseus as being alive and on his way home
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]; he is
in the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of the Thesprotians, and is
bringing back much valuable treasure that he has
begged from one and another of them; but his ship
and all his crew were lost [275] as they were
leaving the Thrinacian island, for Zeus and the
sun-god were angry with him because his men had
slaughtered the sun-god’s cattle, and they were
all drowned to a man. But Odysseus stuck to the
keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of
the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the
immortals, [280] and who treated him as though he
had been a god, giving him many presents, and
wishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact
Odysseus would have been here long ago, had he not
thought better to go from land to land gathering
wealth; [285] for there is no man living who is
full of craftiness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kerdos</foreign>] as he is; there is no one can
compare with him. Pheidon, king of the
Thesprotians, told me all this, and he swore to
me—making drink-offerings in his house as he did
so—that the ship was by the water side and the
crew found [290] who would take Odysseus to his
own country. He sent me off first, for there
happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the
wheat-growing island of Doulikhion, but he showed
me all the treasure Odysseus had got together, and
he had enough lying in the house of King Pheidon
to keep his family for ten generations; [295] but
the king said Odysseus had gone to Dodona that he
might learn Zeus’ mind from the high oak tree, and
know whether after so long an absence he should
return to Ithaca openly or in secret. [300] So you
may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he
is close at hand and cannot remain away from home
much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words
with an oath, and call Zeus who is the first and
mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that
hearth of blameless Odysseus to which I have now
come, [305] that all I have spoken shall surely
come to pass. Odysseus will return in this self
same year; with the end of this moon and the
beginning of the next he will be here.”</p>
<p n="779" start-line="19.308" end-line="19.334">“May it be even so,” answered circumspect
Penelope; “if your words come true [310] you shall
have such gifts and such good will from me that
all who see you shall congratulate you; but I know
very well how it will be. Odysseus will not
return, neither will you get your escort hence,
for so surely as that Odysseus ever was, [315]
there are now no longer any such masters in the
house as he was, to receive honorable strangers or
to further them on their way home. And now, you
maids, wash his feet for him, and make him a bed
on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be
warm and quiet till morning. [320] Then, at day
break wash him and anoint him again, that he may
sit in the hall and take his meals with
Telemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of
these hateful people who is uncivil to him; like
it or not, he shall have no more to do in this
house. [325] For how, sir, shall you be able to
learn whether or no I am superior to others of my
sex both in goodness of heart and understanding
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], if I
let you dine in my halls squalid and ill clad? Men
live but for a little season; <seg
rend="subscript">329</seg> if a man is harsh
himself and thinks harsh thoughts, [330] all men
pray that pains should befall him hereafter <seg
rend="subscript">331</seg> while he is alive. And
when he is dead, all men ridicule [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ephepsioōntai</foreign>] him. <seg
rend="subscript">332</seg> But if a man is
blameless himself and thinks blameless
thoughts, <seg rend="subscript">333</seg> the
guest-strangers [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>xenoi</foreign>] he has entertained carry
his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign> far
and wide <seg rend="subscript">334</seg> to all
mankind, and many are they who call him worthy
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">esthlos</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="780" start-line="19.335" end-line="19.348">[335] Resourceful Odysseus answered, “My Lady,
respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, I have
foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that I
left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard.
I will lie as I have lain on many a sleepless
night hitherto. [340] Night after night have I
passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for
morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet
washed; I shall not let any [345] of the young
hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if
you have any old and respectable woman who has
gone through as much trouble as I have, I will
allow her to wash them.”</p>
<p n="781" start-line="19.349" end-line="19.360">To this circumspect Penelope said, [350] “My
dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to
my house there never was one who spoke in all
things with such admirable propriety as you do.
There happens to be in the house a most
respectable old woman— [355] the same who received
my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was
born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very
feeble now, but she shall wash your feet. Come
here,” said she, “Circumspect Eurykleia, and wash
your master’s age-mate; I suppose Odysseus’ hands
and feet are very much the same now as his are,
[360] for trouble ages all of us dreadfully
fast.”</p>
<p n="782" start-line="19.361" end-line="19.381">On these words the old woman covered her face
with her hands; she began to weep and made
lamentation saying, “My dear child, I cannot think
whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one
was ever more god-fearing than yourself, and yet
Zeus hates you. [365] No one in the whole world
ever burned him more thigh portions, nor gave him
finer hecatombs when you prayed you might come to
a green old age yourself and see your son grow up
to take after you; yet see how he has prevented
you alone from ever getting back to your own home.
[370] I have no doubt the women in some foreign
palace which Odysseus has got to are gibing at him
as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do
not wonder at your not choosing to let them wash
you after the manner in which they have insulted
you; [375] I will wash your feet myself gladly
enough, as circumspect Penelope, daughter of
Ikarios, has said that I am to do so; I will wash
them both for Penelope’s sake and for your own,
for you have raised the most lively feelings of
compassion in my mind; and let me say this
moreover, which pray attend to; we have had all
kinds of strangers in distress come here before
now, [380] but I make bold to say that no one ever
yet came who was so like Odysseus in figure,
voice, and feet as you are.”</p>
<p n="783" start-line="19.382" end-line="19.385">“Those who have seen us both,” answered
resourceful Odysseus, “have always said we were
wonderfully like [385] each other, and now you
have noticed it too.”</p>
<p n="784" start-line="19.386" end-line="19.404">Then the old woman took the cauldron in which
she was going to wash his feet, and poured plenty
of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath
was warm enough. Odysseus sat by the fire, but
before long he turned away from the light, [390]
for it occurred to him that when the old woman had
hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar
which it bore, whereon the whole truth would come
out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her
master, she at once knew the scar as one that had
been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting
on Mount Parnassus with his excellent grandfather
Autolykos— [395] who was the most accomplished
thief and perjurer in the whole world—and with the
sons of Autolykos. Hermes himself had endowed him
with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh
bones of goats and kids to him, so he took
pleasure in his companionship. It happened once
that Autolykos had gone to the district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Ithaca [400]
and had found the child of his daughter just born.
As soon as he had done supper Eurykleia set the
infant upon his knees and said, <seg
rend="subscript">403</seg> “Autolykos! You
yourself must find a name, whatever name you give
him, <seg rend="subscript">404</seg> for the dear
child of your child, since he is the one who has
been very much wished-for [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">polu-ārētos</foreign>] by you
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">toi</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="785" start-line="19.405" end-line="19.412">[405] “Son-in-law and daughter,” replied
Autolykos, “call the child thus: I am highly
displeased with a large number of people in one
place and another, both men and women; so name the
child ‘Odysseus,’ or the child of anger. When he
grows up [410] and comes to visit his mother’s
family on Mount Parnassus, where my possessions
lie, I will make him a present and will send him
on his way rejoicing.”</p>
<p n="786" start-line="19.413" end-line="19.427">Odysseus, therefore, went to Parnassus to get
the presents from Autolykos, who with his sons
[415] shook hands with him and gave him welcome.
His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about
him, and kissed his head, and both his beautiful
eyes, while Autolykos desired his sons to get
dinner ready, and they did as he told them. [420]
They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it,
made it ready and divided it into joints; these
they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and
spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and
served the portions round. Thus through the
livelong day to the going down of the sun [425]
they feasted, and every man had his full share so
that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and
it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the
boon of sleep.</p>
<p n="787" start-line="19.428" end-line="19.466">When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, [430] the sons of Autolykos went out
with their hounds hunting, and noble Odysseus went
too. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus
and soon reached its breezy upland valleys; but as
the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,
fresh-risen from the slow still currents of
Okeanos, [435] they came to a mountain dell. The
dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the
beast they were chasing, and after them came the
sons of Autolykos, among whom was noble Odysseus,
close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in
his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among
some thick brushwood, [440] so dense that the wind
and rain could not get through it, nor could the
sun’s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath
lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the
noise of the men’s feet, and the hounds baying on
every side as the huntsmen came up to him, [445]
so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on
his neck, and stood at bay with fire flashing from
his eyes. Odysseus was the first to raise his
spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the
boar was too quick for him, and charged him
sideways, ripping him [450] above the knee with a
gash that tore deep though it did not reach the
bone. As for the boar, Odysseus hit him on the
right shoulder, and the point of the spear went
right through him, so that he fell groaning in the
dust until the life went out of him. [455] The
sons of Autolykos busied themselves with the
carcass of the boar, and bound stately godlike
Odysseus’ wound; then, after saying a spell to
stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they
could. But when Autolykos and his sons [460] had
thoroughly healed Odysseus, they made him some
splendid presents, and sent him back to Ithaca
with much mutual good will. When he got back, his
father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and
asked him all about it, [465] and how he had hurt
himself to get the scar; so he told them how the
boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with
Autolykos and his sons on Mount Parnassus.</p>
<p n="788" start-line="19.467" end-line="19.475">As soon as Eurykleia had got the scarred limb
in her hands and had well hold of it, she
recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The
leg fell into the bath, which rang out [470] and
was overturned, so that all the water was spilt on
the ground; Eurykleia’s eyes between her joy and
her grief filled with tears, and she could not
speak, but she caught Odysseus by the beard and
said, “My dear child, I am sure you must be
Odysseus himself, only I did not know you [475]
till I had actually touched and handled you.”</p>
<p n="789" start-line="19.476" end-line="19.490">As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as
though wanting to tell her that her dear husband
was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look
in that direction and observe what was going on,
for Athena had diverted her attention [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]; so Odysseus [480]
caught Eurykleia by the throat with his right hand
and with his left drew her close to him, and said,
“Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who
nursed me at your own breast, now that after
twenty years of wandering I am at last come to my
own home again? [485] Since the gods have allowed
you to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not
say a word about it to anyone else in the house,
for if you do, then I tell you—and it shall surely
be—that if the gods grant me to take the lives of
these suitors, I will not spare you, though you
are my own nurse, [490] when I am killing the
other women.”</p>
<p n="790" start-line="19.491" end-line="19.498">“My child,” answered circumspect Eurykleia,
“what are you talking about? You know very well
that nothing can either bend or break me. I will
hold my tongue like a stone or a piece of iron;
[495] furthermore let me say, and lay my saying to
your heart, when the gods have delivered the
suitors into your hand, I will give you a list of
the women in the house who have been ill-behaved,
and of those who are guiltless.”</p>
<p n="791" start-line="19.499" end-line="19.502">And resourceful Odysseus answered, [500]
“Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am
well able to form my own opinion about one and all
of them; hold your tongue and leave everything to
the gods.”</p>
<p n="792" start-line="19.503" end-line="19.508">As he said this Eurykleia left the hall to
fetch some more water, for the first had been
[505] all spilt; and when she had washed him and
anointed him with oil, Odysseus drew his seat
nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the
scar under his rags. Then circumspect Penelope
began talking to him and said:</p>
<p n="793" start-line="19.509" end-line="19.553">“Stranger, I should like to speak with you
briefly about another matter. [510] It is indeed
nearly bed time—for those, at least, who can sleep
in spite of sorrow. As for myself, a superhuman
force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>]
has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>], that
even by day when I am attending to my duties and
looking after the servants, I am still weeping and
lamenting during the whole time; [515] then, when
night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie
awake thinking, and my heart becomes prey to the
most incessant and cruel tortures. <seg
rend="subscript">518</seg>As when the daughter of
Pandareos, the nightingale [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aēdōn</foreign>] in the green <seg
rend="subscript">519</seg> sings beautifully at
the onset anew of springtime, [520] perched in the
dense foliage of trees, <seg rend="subscript"
>521</seg> and she pours forth, changing it around
thick and fast, a voice with many
resoundings, <seg rend="subscript"
>522</seg> lamenting her child, the dear Itylos,
whom once upon a time with weapon of bronze <seg
rend="subscript">523</seg> she killed
inadvertently, the son of Zethos the king— even so
does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty
whether [525] I ought to stay with my son here,
and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the
greatness of my house, out of regard to the
opinion of the local populace [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] and the memory of
my late husband, or whether it is not now time for
me to go with the best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aristos</foreign>]of these suitors who are wooing
me and making me such magnificent presents. [530]
As long as my son was still disconnected [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nēpios</foreign>], and unable to
understand, he would not hear of my leaving my
husband’s house, but now that he is full grown he
begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the
way in which the suitors are eating up his
property. [535] Come, respond [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hupo-krinesthai</foreign>] to my
dream, and hear my telling of it and interpret it
[= make a <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hupokrisis</foreign> of it] for me if you can. I
have twenty geese about the house that eat mash
out of a trough, and of which I am exceedingly
fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping
down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into
the neck of each of them till he had killed them
all. Presently he soared off into the sky, [540]
and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I
wept in my room till all my fair-haired maids
gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving
because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he
came back again, and perching on a projecting
[545] rafter spoke to me with human voice, and
told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’
he said, ‘daughter of far-famed Ikarios; this is
no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall
surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors,
and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband,
who am come back to you, [550] and who will bring
these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ Then I woke,
and when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough
eating their mash as usual.”</p>
<p n="794" start-line="19.554" end-line="19.558">[555] “This dream, my Lady,” replied
resourceful Odysseus, “can admit but of one
interpretation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hupokrisis</foreign>], for had not Odysseus
himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The
death of the suitors is portended, and not one
single one of them will escape.”</p>
<p n="795" start-line="19.559" end-line="19.581">And circumspect Penelope answered, [560]
“Stranger, dreams are very curious and
unaccountable things, and they do not by any means
invariably come true. There are two gates through
which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one
is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come
through the gate of ivory [565] are fatuous, but
those from the gate of horn mean something to
those that see them. I do not think, however, that
my own dream came through the gate of horn, though
I and my son should be most thankful if it proves
to have done so. [570] Furthermore I say—and lay
my saying to your heart—the coming dawn will usher
in the ill-omened day that is to sever me from the
house of Odysseus, for I am about to hold a
tournament [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>] of axes. My husband used to set
up twelve axes in the court, one in front of the
other, like the stays [575] upon which a ship is
built; he would then go back from them and shoot
an arrow through the whole twelve. I shall make
the suitors try to perform the same feat [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], and whichever
of them can string the bow most easily, and send
his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I
follow, and quit this house [580] of my lawful
husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But
even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in
my dreams.”</p>
<p n="796" start-line="19.582" end-line="19.587">Then resourceful Odysseus answered, “Madam wife
of Odysseus, son of Laertes, you need not defer
your tournament [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>], [585] for Odysseus will return
before ever they can string the bow, handle it how
they will, and send their arrows through the
iron.”</p>
<p n="797" start-line="19.588" end-line="19.597">To this circumspect Penelope said, “As long,
sir, as you will sit here [590] and talk to me, I
can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people
cannot do permanently without sleep, and the gods
have appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all
things. I will therefore go upstairs [595] and
recline upon that couch which I have never ceased
to flood with my tears from the day Odysseus set
out for the city with a hateful name.”</p>
<p n="798" start-line="19.600" end-line="19.604">[600] She then went upstairs to her own room,
not alone, but attended by her maidens, and when
there, she lamented her dear husband till
owl-vision Athena shed sweet sleep over her
eyelids.</p>

<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 20</head>
<p n="799" start-line="20.1" end-line="20.21" rend="no-indent">Noble Odysseus slept in the
hall upon an undressed bullock’s hide, on the top
of which he threw several skins of the sheep the
suitors had eaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over
him after he had laid himself down. [5] There,
then, Odysseus lay wakefully brooding upon the way
in which he should kill the suitors; and by and
by, the women who had been in the habit of
misconducting themselves with them, left the house
giggling and laughing with one another. This made
Odysseus very angry, [10] and he doubted whether
to get up and kill every single one of them then
and there, or to let them sleep one more and last
time with the suitors. His heart growled within
him, and as a bitch with puppies [15] growls and
shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did
his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that
were being done: but he beat his breast and said,
“Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear
on the day when the terrifying Cyclops ate [20]
your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence
till your cunning got you safe out of the cave,
though you were sure of being killed.”</p>
<p n="800" start-line="20.22" end-line="20.35">Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it
into endurance, [25] but he tossed about as one
who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then
on the other, that he may get it cooked as soon as
possible, even so did he turn himself about from
side to side, thinking all the time how, single
handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so
large a body of men [30] as the wicked suitors.
But by and by Athena came down from the sky in the
likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head
saying, “My poor unhappy man, why do you lie awake
in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe
inside it, and so is [35] your son who is just
such a young man as any father may be proud
of.”</p>
<p n="801" start-line="20.36" end-line="20.43">“Goddess,” answered resourceful Odysseus, “all
that you have said is true, but I am in some doubt
as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked
suitors single handed, [40] seeing what a number
of them there always are. And there is this
further difficulty, which is still more
considerable. Supposing that with Zeus’ and your
assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask
you to consider where I am to escape to from their
avengers when it is all over.”</p>
<p n="802" start-line="20.44" end-line="20.53">[45] “For shame,” replied the owl-vision
goddess Athena, “why, anyone else would trust a
worse ally than myself, even though that ally were
only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I not a
goddess, and have I not protected you throughout
in all your ordeals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ponos</foreign>]? I tell you plainly that even
though there were fifty bands of men [50]
surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should
take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them
away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad
thing to lie awake all night, and you shall be out
of your troubles before long.”</p>
<p n="803" start-line="20.54" end-line="20.55">As she, shining among goddesses, spoke she shed
sleep over his eyes, [55] and then went back to
Olympus.</p>
<p n="804" start-line="20.56" end-line="20.90">While Odysseus was thus yielding himself to a
very deep slumber that eased the burden of his
sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up
in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved
herself by weeping [60] she prayed to Artemis
saying, “Great Goddess Artemis, daughter of Zeus,
drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; <seg
rend="subscript">63</seg> or later, may a gust of
wind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thuella</foreign>]
abduct me; <seg rend="subscript">64</seg> may it
go off and take me away along misty ways, [65] and
plunge me into the streams of Okeanos, which flows
in a circle. <seg rend="subscript">66</seg> as
when the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thuellai</foreign> took away the daughters of
Pandareos. The daughters of Pandareos lost their
father and mother, for the gods killed them, so
they were left orphans. But radiant Aphrodite took
care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and
sweet [70] wine. Hera taught them to excel all
women in beauty of form and understanding; chaste
Artemis gave them an imposing presence, and Athena
endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;
but one day when bright Aphrodite had gone up to
Olympus to see Zeus about getting them married
[75] (for well does he know both what shall happen
and what not happen to every one) <seg
rend="subscript">77</seg> then the whirlwinds
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">harpuiai</foreign>]
abducted the girls to become handmaids to the
dread Furies [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>Erinyes</foreign>]. Even so I wish that the gods
who live in the sky [80] would hide me from mortal
sight, or that sweet-haired Artemis might strike
me, for I want to go even beneath the sad earth if
I might do so still looking towards Odysseus only,
and without having to yield myself to a worse man
than he was. Besides, no matter how much people
may grieve by day, [85] they can put up with it so
long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes
are closed in slumber people forget good and ill
alike; whereas my miserable fate [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] haunts me even
in my dreams. This very night I thought there was
one lying by my side who was like Odysseus as he
was when he went away with his army, [90] and I
rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but
the very truth itself.”</p>
<p n="805" start-line="20.91" end-line="20.101">Then the day broke, but great Odysseus heard
the sound of her weeping, and it puzzled him, for
it seemed as though she already knew him and was
by his side. [95] Then he gathered up the cloak
and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set them
on a seat in the hall, but he took the bullock’s
hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to
the sky, and prayed, saying “Father Zeus, since
you have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to
my own home after all the afflictions you have
laid upon me, [100] give me a sign out of the
mouth of some one or other of those who are now
waking within the house, and let me have another
sign of some kind from outside.”</p>
<p n="806" start-line="20.102" end-line="20.119">Thus did he pray. Zeus of the counsels heard
his prayer and right away thundered high up among
the clouds from the splendor of Olympus, and noble
Odysseus was glad when he heard it. [105] At the
same time within the house, a miller-woman from
hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and
gave him another sign. There were twelve
miller-women whose business it was to grind wheat
and barley which are the staff of life. The others
had ground their task and had gone to take their
rest, [110] but this one had not yet finished, for
she was not so strong as they were, and when she
heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave
the sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>]
to her master. “Father Zeus,” said she, “you who
rule over the sky and earth, you have thundered
from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,
and this means something for somebody; [115] grant
the prayer, then, of me your poor servant who
calls upon you, and let this be the very last day
that the suitors dine in the house of Odysseus.
They have worn me out with the labor of grinding
meal for them, and I hope they may never have
another dinner anywhere at all.”</p>
<p n="807" start-line="20.120" end-line="20.121">[120] Great Odysseus was glad when he heard the
omens conveyed to him by the woman’s speech, and
by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he
should avenge himself on the suitors.</p>
<p n="808" start-line="20.122" end-line="20.133">Then the other maids in the house rose and lit
the fire on the hearth; Telemachus, a man like a
god, also rose [125] and put on his clothes. He
girded his sword about his shoulder, bound his
sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty
spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he
went to the threshold of the hall and said to
Eurykleia, “Nurse, did you make the stranger
comfortable [130] both as regards bed and board,
or did you let him shift for himself?—for my
mother, good woman though she is, has a way of
paying great attention to second-rate people, and
of neglecting others who are in reality much
better men.”</p>
<p n="809" start-line="20.134" end-line="20.143">[135] “Do not find fault, child,” said
circumspect Eurykleia, “when there is no one to
find fault with. The stranger sat and drank his
wine as long as he liked: your mother did ask him
if he would take any more bread and he said he
would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told
the servants to make one for him, [140] but he
said he was such a wretched outcast that he would
not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted
on having an undressed bullock’s hide and some
sheepskins put for him in the hall and I threw a
cloak over him myself.”</p>
<p n="810" start-line="20.144" end-line="20.156">Then Telemachus went out of the court [145] to
the place where the Achaeans were meeting in
assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was
not alone, for his two light-footed dogs went with
him. But Eurykleia, shining among women, daughter
of Ops, son of Peisenor, called the maids and
said, “Come, wake up; set about sweeping the halls
[150] and sprinkling them with water to lay the
dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the
tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out
the mixing-jugs and the cups, and go for water
from the fountain at once; [155] the suitors will
be here directly; they will be here early, for it
is a feast day.”</p>
<p n="811" start-line="20.157" end-line="20.167">Thus did she speak, and they did even as she
had said: twenty of them went to the fountain for
water, and the others set themselves busily to
work about the house. [160] The men who were in
attendance on the suitors also came up and began
chopping firewood. By and by the women returned
from the fountain, and the swineherd came after
them with the three best pigs he could pick out.
These he let feed about the premises, [165] and
then he said good-humoredly to Odysseus,
“Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better
now, or are they as insolent as ever?”</p>
<p n="812" start-line="20.168" end-line="20.171">“May the gods,” answered resourceful Odysseus,
“requite to them the wickedness [170] with which
they deal high-handedly in another man’s house
without any sense of shame [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="813" start-line="20.172" end-line="20.182">Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthios
the goatherd came up, for he too was bringing in
his best goats [175] for the suitors’ dinner; and
he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats
up under the gatehouse, and then Melanthios began
gibing at Odysseus. “Are you still here,
stranger,” said he, “to pester people by begging
about the house? Why can you not go [180]
elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an
understanding before we have given each other a
taste of our fists. You beg without any sense of
decency [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kosmos</foreign>]: are there not feasts elsewhere
among the Achaeans, as well as here?”</p>
<p n="814" start-line="20.183" end-line="20.196">Resourceful Odysseus made no answer, but bowed
his head and brooded. [185] Then a third man,
Philoitios, leader of people, joined them, who was
bringing in a barren heifer and some goats. These
were brought over by the boatmen who are there to
take people over when anyone comes to them. So
Philoitios made his heifer and his goats secure
under the gatehouse, [190] and then went up to the
swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he, “is this
stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of
your men? What is his family? Where does he come
from? Poor man, he looks as if he had been some
great man, [195] but the gods give sorrow to whom
they will—even to kings if it so pleases
them.”</p>
<p n="815" start-line="20.197" end-line="20.225">As he spoke he went up to Odysseus and saluted
him with his right hand; “Good day to you, father
stranger,” said he, [200] “you seem to be very
poorly off now, but I hope you will have better
times [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>]
by and by. Father Zeus, of all gods you are the
most malicious. We are your own children, yet you
show us no mercy in all our misery and
afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this
man, and my eyes filled with tears, [205] for he
reminds me of blameless Odysseus, who I fear is
going about in just such rags as this man’s are,
if indeed he is still among the living. If he is
already dead and in the house of Hādēs, then,
alas! for my good master, who made me [210] his
stockman when I was quite young in the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of the
Kephallēnians, and now his cattle are countless;
no one could have done better with them than I
have, for they have bred like ears of wheat;
nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for
others to eat, who take no heed of his son though
he is in the house, [215] and fear not the wrath
of the gods, but are already eager to divide
Odysseus’ property among them because he has been
away so long. I have often thought—only it would
not be right while his son is living—of going off
with the cattle to some foreign district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]; bad as this
would be, [220] it is still harder to stay here
and be ill-treated about other people’s herds. My
position is intolerable, and I should long since
have run away and put myself under the protection
of some other chief, only that I believe my poor
master will yet return, [225] and send all these
suitors fleeing out of the house.”</p>
<p n="816" start-line="20.226" end-line="20.234">“Stockman,” answered resourceful Odysseus, “you
seem to be a very well-disposed person, and I can
see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will
tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath:
[230] by Zeus, the chief of all gods, and by that
hearth of blameless Odysseus to which I am now
come, Odysseus shall return before you leave this
place, and if you are so minded you shall see him
killing the suitors who are now masters here.”</p>
<p n="817" start-line="20.235" end-line="20.237">[235] “If Zeus, son of Kronos, were to bring
this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should
see how I would do my very utmost to help
him.”</p>
<p n="818" start-line="20.238" end-line="20.246">And in like manner Eumaios prayed that the
spirited Odysseus might return home. [240] Thus
did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were
hatching a plot to murder Telemachus: but a bird
flew near them on their left hand—an eagle with a
dove in its talons. Then Amphinomos said, [245]
“My friends, this plot of ours to murder
Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner
instead.”</p>
<p n="819" start-line="20.247" end-line="20.256">The others assented, so they went inside and
laid their cloaks on the benches and seats. [250]
They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the
heifer, and when the innards were cooked they
served them round. They mixed the wine in the
mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his
cup, while Philoitios, leader of men, handed round
the bread [255] in the breadbaskets, and
Melanthios poured them out their wine. Then they
laid their hands upon the good things that were
before them.</p>
<p n="820" start-line="20.257" end-line="20.267">Telemachus, with craftiness [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>], made Odysseus
sit in the part of the hall that was paved with
stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a
little table to himself, [260] and had his portion
of the innards brought to him, with his wine in a
gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your
wine among the great people. I will put a stop to
the gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no
public house, [265] but belongs to Odysseus, and
has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors,
keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or
there will be trouble.”</p>
<p n="821" start-line="20.268" end-line="20.274">The suitors bit their lips, and marveled at the
boldness of his speech; [270] then Antinoos, son
of Eupeithes said, “We do not like such language
but we will put up with it, for Telemachus is
threatening us in good earnest. If Zeus son of
Kronos had let us we should have put a stop to his
brave talk before now.”</p>
<p n="822" start-line="20.275" end-line="20.278">[275] Thus spoke Antinoos, but Telemachus
heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were
bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and
the Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of
Apollo.</p>
<p n="823" start-line="20.279" end-line="20.283">Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off
the spits, [280] gave every man his portion, and
feasted to their hearts’ content; those who waited
at table gave godlike Odysseus exactly the same
portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told
them to do so.</p>
<p n="824" start-line="20.284" end-line="20.298">But Athena would not let [285] the suitors for
one moment drop their insolence, for she wanted
Odysseus, son of Laertes, to feel even more
bitterness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>akhos</foreign>] against them. Now there happened
to be among them a ribald character, whose name
was Ktesippos, and who came from Samē. This man,
confident in his great wealth, [290] was paying
court to the wife of Odysseus, and said to the
suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger
has already had as large a portion as anyone else;
this is well, for it is not right nor reasonable
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>] to
ill-treat any [295] guest of Telemachus who comes
here. I will, however, make him a present on my
own account, that he may have something to give to
the bath-woman, or to some other of godlike
Odysseus’ servants.” As he spoke he picked up a
heifer’s foot [300] from the meat-basket in which
it lay, and threw it at Odysseus, but Odysseus
turned his head a little aside, and avoided it,
smiling sardonically as he did so, and it hit the
wall, not him. Then Telemachus spoke fiercely to
Ktesippos, “It is a good thing for you,” said he,
“that the stranger turned his head so that [305]
you missed him. If you had hit him I should have
run you through with my spear, and your father
would have had to see about getting you buried
rather than married in this house. So let me have
no more unseemly behavior from any of you, for I
am grown up now to the knowledge of good [310] and
evil and understand what is going on, instead of
being the child that I have been heretofore. I
have long seen you killing my sheep and making
free with my wheat and wine: I have put up with
this, for one man is no match for many, but do me
no further violence. [315] Still, if you wish to
kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see
such disgraceful scenes day after day—guests
insulted, and men dragging the women servants
about the house in an unseemly way.”</p>
<p n="825" start-line="20.299" end-line="20.319">[320] They all held their peace till at last
Agelaos, son of Damastor, said, “No one should
take offence at what has just been said, nor
gainsay it, for it is quite reasonable [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>]. Leave off,
therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or anyone
else [325] of the servants who are about the
house; I would say, however, a friendly word to
Telemachus and his mother, which I trust may
commend itself to both. ‘As long,’ I would say,
‘as you had ground for hoping that Odysseus would
one day come home, [330] no one could complain of
[= “there will be no <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nemesis</foreign> as a result of”] your waiting
and suffering the suitors to be in your house. It
would have been better that he should have
returned, but it is now sufficiently clear that he
will never do so; therefore talk all this quietly
over with your mother, [335] and tell her to marry
the best man, and the one who makes her the most
advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able
to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and
drink in peace, while your mother will look after
some other man’s house, not yours.’”</p>
<p n="826" start-line="20.320" end-line="20.337">To this the spirited Telemachus answered, “By
Zeus, Agelaos, and by the sorrows [340] of my
unhappy father, who has either perished far from
Ithaca, or is wandering in some distant land, I
throw no obstacles in the way of my mother’s
marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose
whomsoever she will, and I will give her
numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not
insist point blank that she shall leave the house
against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I
should do this.”</p>
<p n="827" start-line="20.338" end-line="20.344">[345] Athena now made the suitors fall to
laughing immoderately, and set their wits
wandering; but they were laughing with a forced
laughter. Their meat became smeared with blood;
their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts
were heavy with forebodings. [350] Godlike
Theoklymenos saw this and said, “Unhappy men, what
is it that ails you? There is a shroud of darkness
drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are
wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing
voices; the walls and roof-beams drip blood; [355]
the gate of the halls and the court beyond them
are full of spirits trooping down into the night
of the netherworld; the sun is blotted out of the
sky, and a blighting gloom is over all the
land.”</p>
<p n="828" start-line="20.345" end-line="20.357">Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed
heartily. Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, then said,
[360] “This stranger who has lately come here has
lost his senses. Servants, turn him out into the
streets, since he finds it so dark here.”</p>
<p n="829" start-line="20.358" end-line="20.370">But godlike Theoklymenos said, “Eurymakhos, you
need not send anyone with me. [365] I have eyes,
ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing
of an understanding mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>]. I will take these out of the
house with me, <seg rend="subscript"
>367</seg> since I notice [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>] that evil fortune
is coming upon you, from which not one of you men
who are insulting people [370] and plotting ill
deeds in the house of godlike Odysseus will be
able to escape.”</p>
<p n="830" start-line="20.371" end-line="20.383">He left the house as he spoke, and went back to
Piraios who gave him welcome, but the suitors kept
looking at one another and provoking Telemachus by
laughing at the strangers. [375] One insolent man
said to him, “Telemachus, you are not happy in
your guests; first you have this importunate
tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no
skill for work or for hard fighting [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>], but is perfectly
useless, [380] and now here is another man who is
setting himself up as a prophet. Let me persuade
you, for it will be much better, to put them on
board ship and send them off to the Sicilians to
sell for what they will bring.”</p>
<p n="831" start-line="20.384" end-line="20.386">Telemachus gave him no heed, [385] but sat
silently watching his father, expecting every
moment that he would begin his attack upon the
suitors.</p>
<p n="832" start-line="20.387" end-line="20.394">Meanwhile the daughter of Ikarios,
high-spirited Penelope, had had a rich seat placed
for her facing the court and halls, so that she
could hear what every one was saying. [390] The
dinner indeed had been prepared amid merriment; it
had been both good and abundant, for they had
sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to
come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome
than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were
soon to lay before them—for they had brought their
doom upon themselves.</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 21</head>
<p n="833" start-line="21.1" end-line="21.41" rend="no-indent">The owl-vision goddess Athena
now put it in daughter of Ikarios, circumspect
Penelope’s, mind to make the suitors try their
skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in
contest among themselves, as a means of bringing
about their destruction. [5] She went upstairs and
got the store room key, which was made of bronze
and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her
maidens into the store room at the end of the
house, where her husband’s treasures [10] of gold,
bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was
also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows
that had been given him by a friend whom he had
met in Lacedaemon—Iphitos, the son of Eurytos, one
like the immortal gods. [15] The two fell in with
one another in Messene at the house of
high-spirited Ortilokhos, where Odysseus was
staying in order to recover a debt that was owing
from the whole district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>]; for the Messenians had carried
off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had
sailed away with them and with their shepherds.
[20] In quest of these Odysseus took a long
journey while still quite young, for his father
and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to
recover them. Iphitos had gone there also to try
and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost,
and the mule foals that were running with them.
These mares were the death of him in the end, [25]
for when he went to the house of strong-hearted
Zeus’ son, mighty Hēraklēs, who performed such
prodigies of valor, Hēraklēs to his shame killed
him, though he was his guest, for he feared not
the gods’ vengeance, nor yet respected his own
table which he had set before Iphitos, but killed
him in spite of everything, [30] and kept the
mares himself. It was when claiming these that
Iphitos met Odysseus, and gave him the bow which
mighty Eurytos had been used to carry, and which
on his death had been left by him to his son.
Odysseus gave him in return a sword and a spear,
[35] and this was the beginning of a fast
friendship, although they never visited at one
another’s houses, for Zeus’ son Hēraklēs killed
Iphitos before they could do so. This bow, then,
given him by Iphitos, son of Eurytos, one like the
gods, had not been taken with him by Odysseus when
he sailed for Troy; [40] he had used it so long as
he had been at home, but had left it behind as
having been a keepsake from a valued friend.</p>
<p n="834" start-line="21.42" end-line="21.67">Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of
the store room; the carpenter had planed this
duly, [45] and had drawn a line on it so as to get
it quite straight; he had then set the door posts
into it and hung the doors. She loosed the strap
from the handle of the door, put in the key, and
drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts
that held the doors; these flew open with a noise
[50] like a bull bellowing in a meadow, and
Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where
the chests stood in which the fair linen and
clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs:
reaching thence, she took down the bow with its
bow case from the peg on which it hung. [55] She
sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as
she took the bow out of its case, and when her
tears had relieved her, she went to the hall where
the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver,
[60] with the many deadly arrows that were inside
it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a
chest that contained much iron and bronze that her
husband had won as prizes. When she reached the
suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts
supporting the roof of the hall, [65] holding a
veil before her face, and with a maid on either
side of her. Then she said:</p>
<p n="835" start-line="21.68" end-line="21.79">“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in
abusing the hospitality of this house [70] because
its owner has been long absent, and without other
pretext than that you want to marry me; this,
then, being the prize that you are contending for,
I will bring out the mighty bow of godlike
Odysseus, [75] and whomsoever of you shall string
it most easily and send his arrow through each one
of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this
house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so
abounding in wealth. But even so I doubt not that
I shall remember it in my dreams.”</p>
<p n="836" start-line="21.80" end-line="21.95">[80] As she spoke, she told Eumaios the noble
swineherd to set the bow and the pieces of iron
before the suitors, and Eumaios wept as he took
them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by, the
stockman wept also when he saw his master’s bow,
but Antinoos scolded them. [85] “You country
louts,” said he, “inept simpletons; why should you
add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in
this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss
of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your
dinners in silence, or go [90] outside if you want
to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors
shall have to engage in a contest [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] for it with
might and main, for we shall find it no light
matter to string such a bow as this is. There is
not a man of us all who is such another as
Odysseus; for I have seen him [95] and remember
him, though I was then only a child.”</p>
<p n="837" start-line="21.96" end-line="21.100">This was what he said, but all the time he was
expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot
through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the
first that should taste of the arrows from the
hands of blameless Odysseus, whom he was
dishonoring [100] in his own house—egging the
others on to do so also.</p>
<p n="838" start-line="21.101" end-line="21.117">Then the hallowed prince Telemachus spoke.
“Skies above!” he exclaimed, “Zeus, son of Kronos,
must have robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear
and excellent mother saying she will quit this
house and marry again, [105] yet I am laughing and
enjoying myself as though there were nothing
happening. But, suitors, as the contest [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] has been agreed
upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose
peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or
Mycenae, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland.
[110] You know this as well as I do; what need
have I to speak in praise [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">ainos</foreign>] of my mother?
Come on, then, make no excuses for delay, but let
us see whether you can string the bow or no. I,
too, will make trial of it, for if I can string it
and shoot through the iron, [115] I shall not
suffer my mother to quit this house with a
stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my
father won before me.”</p>
<p n="839" start-line="21.118" end-line="21.130">As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his
crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from
his shoulder. [120] First he set the axes in a
row, in a long groove which he had dug for them,
and had made straight by line. Then he stamped the
earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised
when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had
never seen anything of the kind before. This done,
he went on to the pavement to make trial of the
bow; [125] three times did he tug at it, trying
with all his might to draw the string, and three
times he had to rest his strength [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>], though he had
hoped to string the bow and shoot through the
iron. He was trying, with all his strength
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>], for the
fourth time, and would have strung it had not
Odysseus made a sign to check him in spite of all
his eagerness. [130] So he said:</p>
<p n="840" start-line="21.131" end-line="21.140">“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of
no prowess, or I am too young, and have not yet
reached my full strength so as to be able to hold
my own if any one attacks me. You others,
therefore, who have more strength [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] than I, [135] make
trial of the bow and get this contest [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] settled.” Then
he put the bow down, letting it lean against the
door [that led into the house] with the arrow
standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat
down on the seat from which he had risen, [140]
and Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, said:</p>
<p n="841" start-line="21.141" end-line="21.142">“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards
the right from the place at which the cupbearer
begins when he is handing round the wine.”</p>
<p n="842" start-line="21.143" end-line="21.162">The rest agreed, and Leiodes, son of Oinops,
was the first to rise. [145] He was sacrificial
priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near
the mixing-bowl. He was the only man to whom their
evil deeds were hateful [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ekhthrai</foreign>] and was indignant with the
others. He was now the first to take the bow and
arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his
trial, [150] but he could not string the bow, for
his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they
therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the
suitors, “My friends, I cannot string it; let
another have it; this bow shall take the life and
spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>]
out of many a chief among us, for it is better to
die [155] than to live after having missed the
prize that we have so long striven for, and which
has brought us so long together. Some one of us is
even now hoping and praying that he may marry
Penelope, wife of Odysseus, but when he has seen
this bow and tried it, [160] let him woo and make
bridal offerings to some other fair-robed woman,
and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best
offer and whose lot it is to win her.”</p>
<p n="843" start-line="21.163" end-line="21.174">Then he put the bow down, letting it lean
against the door, [165] with the arrow standing
against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat
again on the seat from which he had risen; and
Antinoos rebuked him saying: “Leiodes, what are
you talking about? Your words are monstrous and
intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you.
[170] Shall, then, this bow take the life
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of
many a chief among us, merely because you cannot
bend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an
archer, but there are others who will soon string
it.”</p>
<p n="844" start-line="21.175" end-line="21.180">[175] Then he said to Melanthios the goatherd,
“Look sharp, light a fire in the court, and set a
seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us
also a large ball of lard, from what they have in
the house. Let us warm the bow and grease it;
[180] we will then make trial of it again, and
bring the contest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>āthlos</foreign>] to an end.”</p>
<p n="845" start-line="21.181" end-line="21.187">Melanthios lit the fire, and set a seat covered
with sheep skins beside it. He also brought a
great ball of lard from what they had in the
house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again
made trial of it, but they were unable [185] to
string it, and they were by far inferior in
strength [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>].
Nevertheless there still remained Antinoos and
Eurymakhos, who were the ringleaders among the
suitors and much the foremost in excellence
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] among
them all.</p>
<p n="846" start-line="21.188" end-line="21.192">Then the swineherd and the stockman left the
halls together, [190] and great Odysseus followed
them. When they had got outside the gates and the
outer yard, Odysseus said to them quietly:</p>
<p n="847" start-line="21.193" end-line="21.198">“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something
in my mind which I am in doubt whether to say or
no; but I think I will say it. [195] What manner
of men would you be to stand by Odysseus, if some
god should bring him back here all of a sudden?
Say which you are disposed to do—to side with the
suitors, or with Odysseus?”</p>
<p n="848" start-line="21.199" end-line="21.202">[200] “Father Zeus,” answered the stockman,
“would indeed that you might so ordain it. If some
superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>daimōn</foreign>] were but to bring Odysseus
back, you should see with what might and main I
would fight for him.”</p>
<p n="849" start-line="21.203" end-line="21.220">In like words Eumaios prayed to all the gods
that the spirited Odysseus might return; [205]
when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] they
were of, Odysseus said, “It is I, Odysseus, who am
here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the
twentieth year, I am come back to my own country.
I find that you two alone of all my servants [210]
are glad that I should do so, for I have not heard
any of the others praying for my return. To you
two, therefore, will I unfold the truth [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alētheia</foreign>] as it shall
be. If the gods shall deliver the suitors into my
hands, I will find wives for both of you, will
give you [215] house and holding close to my own,
and you shall be to me as though you were brothers
and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you a
convincing sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sēma</foreign>] that you may know me and be
assured. See, here is the scar from the boar’s
tooth [220] that ripped me when I was out hunting
on Mount Parnassus with the sons of
Autolykos.”</p>
<p n="850" start-line="21.221" end-line="21.227">As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the
great scar, and when they had examined it
thoroughly, they both of them wept about the
high-spirited Odysseus, threw their arms round him
and kissed his head and shoulders, [225] while
Odysseus kissed their hands and faces in return.
The sun would have gone down upon their mourning
if high-spirited Odysseus had not checked them and
said:</p>
<p n="851" start-line="21.228" end-line="21.241">“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come
outside and see us, and tell those who are within.
When you go in, [230] do so separately, not both
together; I will go first, and do you follow
afterwards. Let this moreover be the sign
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] between
us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me
from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,
therefore, Eumaios, [235] place it in my hands
when you are carrying it about, and tell the women
to close the doors of their apartment. If they
hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting
about the house, they must not come out; they must
keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.
[240] And I charge you, noble Philoitios, to make
fast the doors of the outer court, and to bind
them securely at once.”</p>
<p n="852" start-line="21.242" end-line="21.244">When he had thus spoken, he went back to the
house and took the seat that he had left.
Presently, his two servants followed him
inside.</p>
<p n="853" start-line="21.245" end-line="21.255">[245] At this moment the bow was in the hands
of Eurymakhos, who was warming it by the fire, but
even so he could not string it, and he was greatly
grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, “I feel
grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]
for myself and for us all; [250] I grieve that I
shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not
care nearly so much about this, for there are
plenty of other women in Ithaca and
elsewhere; <seg rend="subscript">253</seg> but if
indeed we are so inferior in <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign> <seg
rend="subscript">254</seg> to godlike Odysseus
that we cannot [255] string his bow, this will
disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet
unborn.”</p>
<p n="854" start-line="21.256" end-line="21.268">“It shall not be so, Eurymakhos,” said
Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, “and you know it
yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout
all the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>]; who can string a bow on such a
day as this? Put it on one side— [260] as for the
axes they can stay where they are, for no one is
likely to come to the house and take them away:
let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we
may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter
of the bow; [265] we will tell Melanthios the
goatherd to bring us in some goats tomorrow—the
best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to
Apollo, the mighty archer, and again make trial of
the bow, so as to bring the contest [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] to an end.”</p>
<p n="855" start-line="21.269" end-line="21.284">The rest approved his words, [270] and then men
servants poured water over the hands of the
guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with
wine and water and handed it round after giving
every man his drink-offering. Then, when they had
made their offerings and had drunk each as much as
he desired, resourceful Odysseus craftily said:
[275] “Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen
that I may speak even as I am minded. I appeal
more especially to Eurymakhos, and to godlike
Antinoos who has just spoken with so much reason.
Cease shooting for the present and leave the
matter to the gods, [280] but in the morning let
the gods give victory to whom they will. For the
moment, however, give me the bow that I may prove
the power of my hands among you all, and see
whether I still have as much strength as I used to
have, or whether travel and neglect have made an
end of it.”</p>
<p n="856" start-line="21.285" end-line="21.310">[285] This made them all very angry, for they
feared he might string the bow; Antinoos therefore
rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature,
you have not so much as a grain of sense in your
whole body; you ought to think yourself lucky in
being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters,
[290] without having any smaller portion served
you than we others have had, and in being allowed
to hear our conversation. No other beggar or
stranger has been allowed to hear what we say
among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you
a mischief, as it does with all those who drink
immoderately. [295] It was wine that inflamed the
Centaur, famous Eurytion, when he was staying with
great-hearted Perithoös among the Lapiths. When
the wine had got into his head he went mad and did
ill deeds about the house of Perithoös; this gave
grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]
to the heroes who were there assembled, so they
rushed at him [300] and cut off his ears and
nostrils; then they dragged him through the
doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed,
and bore the burden [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>atē</foreign>] of his crime, bereft of
understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was
war between humankind and the centaurs, but he
brought it upon himself through his own
drunkenness. [305] In like manner I can tell you
that it will go hardly with you if you string the
bow: you will find no mercy from any one in our
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], for we shall at once ship you
off to king Ekhetos, who kills every one that
comes near him: you will never get away alive, so
drink and keep quiet [310] without getting into a
quarrel with men younger than yourself.”</p>
<p n="857" start-line="21.311" end-line="21.319">Circumspect Penelope then spoke to him.
“Antinoos,” said she, “it is not right [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dikaios</foreign>] that you should
ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to
this house. If the stranger should prove that he
has strength [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>biē</foreign>] [315] enough to string the mighty
bow of Odysseus, can you suppose that he would
take me home with him and make me his wife? Even
the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:
none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it
would be out of all reason.”</p>
<p n="858" start-line="21.320" end-line="21.329">[320] “Daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Queen
Penelope,” answered Eurymakhos, son of Polybos,
“we do not suppose that this man will take you
away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid
lest some of the baser sort, men or women among
the Achaeans, [325] should go gossiping about and
say, ‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are
paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow
not one of them was able to string, and yet a
beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at
once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This is
what will be said, and it will be a scandal
against us.”</p>
<p n="859" start-line="21.330" end-line="21.342">[330] “Eurymakhos,” circumspect Penelope
answered, “people who persist in eating up the
estate of a great chieftain and dishonoring his
house must not expect others in the district
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] to
think well of them. Why then should you mind if
men talk as you think they will? This stranger is
strong and well-built, [335] he says moreover that
he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us
see whether he can string it or no. I say—and it
shall surely be—that if Apollo grants him the
glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak and
khiton of good wear, [340] with a javelin to keep
off dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will
also give him sandals, and will see him sent
safely wherever he wants to go.”</p>
<p n="860" start-line="21.343" end-line="21.353">Then the spirited Telemachus said, “Mother, I
am the only man either in Ithaca or in the islands
that are over against Elis [345] who has the right
to let any one have the bow or to refuse it. No
one shall force me one way or the other, not even
though I choose to make the stranger a present of
the bow outright, and let him take it away with
him. [350] Go, then, within the house and busy
yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your
distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This
bow is a man’s matter, and mine above all others,
for it is I who am master here.”</p>
<p n="861" start-line="21.354" end-line="21.358">She went wondering back into the house, [355]
and laid her son’s saying in her heart. Then going
upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she
mourned her dear husband till owl-vision Athena
sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.</p>
<p n="862" start-line="21.359" end-line="21.365">The swineherd now took up the bow and was for
taking it to Odysseus, her beloved husband, [360]
but the suitors clamored at him from all parts of
the halls, and one of them said, “You idiot, where
are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your
wits? If Apollo [365] and the other gods will
grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get
you into some quiet little place, and worry you to
death.”</p>
<p n="863" start-line="21.366" end-line="21.375">Eumaios was frightened at the outcry they all
raised, so he put the bow down then and there, but
Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side
of the halls, and threatened him saying, “Father
Eumaios, bring the bow on in spite of them, [370]
or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back
to the country, for I am the stronger [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] man of the two. I
wish I was as much stronger than all the other
suitors in the house as I am than you, I would
soon send some of them off sick and sorry, [375]
for they mean mischief.”</p>
<p n="864" start-line="21.376" end-line="21.385">Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed
heartily, which put them in a better humor with
Telemachus; so Eumaios brought the bow on and
placed it in the hands of high-spirited Odysseus.
[380] When he had done this, he called Eurykleia
apart and said to her, “Circumspect Eurykleia,
Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the
women’s apartments. If they hear any groaning or
uproar as of men fighting about the house, they
are not [385] to come out, but are to keep quiet
and stay where they are at their work.”</p>
<p n="865" start-line="21.386" end-line="21.400">Eurykleia did as she was told and closed the
doors of the women’s apartments. Meanwhile
Philoitios slipped quietly out and made fast the
gates of the outer court. [390] There was a ship’s
cable of byblus fiber lying in the gatehouse, so
he made the gates fast with it and then came in
again, resuming the seat that he had left, and
keeping an eye on Odysseus, who had now got the
bow in his hands, and was turning it every way
about, and proving it all over [395] to see
whether the worms had been eating into its two
horns during his absence. Then would one turn
towards his neighbor saying, “This is some tricky
old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at
home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike
style [400] does the old vagabond handle it.”</p>
<p n="866" start-line="21.401" end-line="21.403">Another said, “I hope he may be no more
successful in other things than he is likely to be
in stringing this bow.”</p>
<p n="867" start-line="21.404" end-line="21.415">But resourceful Odysseus, [405] when he had
taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as
easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his
lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends.
[410] Then he took it in his right hand to prove
the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch
like the twittering of a swallow. The suitors felt
dismay [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>],
and turned color as they heard it; at that moment,
moreover, Zeus thundered loudly as a sign
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>], and the
heart of long-suffering great Odysseus rejoiced
[415] as he heard the omen that the son of
scheming Kronos had sent him.</p>
<p n="868" start-line="21.416" end-line="21.423">He took an arrow that was lying upon the
table—for those which the Achaeans were so shortly
about to taste were all inside the quiver—he laid
it on the center-piece of the bow, and drew the
notch of the arrow [420] and the string toward
him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken
aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of
the handle-holes of the axes from the first
onwards till it had gone right through them, and
into the outer courtyard. Then he said to
Telemachus:</p>
<p n="869" start-line="21.424" end-line="21.430">[425] “Your guest has not disgraced you,
Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at, and I
was not long in stringing my bow. I am still
strong, and not as the suitors reproach me with
being. Now, however, it is time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] for the Achaeans
to prepare supper while there is still daylight,
and then otherwise <seg rend="subscript"
>429</seg> to get amusement [430] with singing and
the lyre: for these are the things that go on at a
feast [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dais</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="870" start-line="21.431" end-line="21.434">As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows,
and Telemachus girded on his sword, grasped his
spear, and stood armed beside his father’s
seat.</p>
</div>
<div n="2">
<head>Rhapsody 22</head>
<p n="871" start-line="22.1" end-line="22.7" rend="no-indent">Then resourceful Odysseus tore
off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement
with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He
shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and
said, [5] “The mighty contest [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] is at an end. I
will now see whether Apollo will grant it to me to
hit another mark which no man has yet hit.”</p>
<p n="872" start-line="22.8" end-line="22.30">Then he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinoos, who
was about to take up a two-handled [10] gold cup
to drink his wine and already had it in his hands.
He had no thought of death—who amongst all the
revelers would think that one man, however brave,
would stand alone among so many and kill him? [15]
The arrow struck Antinoos in the throat, and the
point went clean through his neck, so that he fell
over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a
thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He
kicked [20] the table from him and upset the
things on it, so that the bread and roasted meats
were all soiled as they fell over on to the
ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they
saw that a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay
one and all of them from their seats and looked
everywhere towards the walls, [25] but there was
neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked
Odysseus very angrily. “Stranger,” said they, “you
shall pay for shooting people in this way: you
shall see no other contest [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>]; you are a
doomed man; he whom you have slain was the
foremost [30] youth in Ithaca, and the vultures
shall devour you for having killed him.”</p>
<p n="873" start-line="22.31" end-line="22.33">Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had
killed Antinoos by mistake, and did not perceive
that death was hanging over the head of every one
of them. But resourceful Odysseus glared at them
and said:</p>
<p n="874" start-line="22.34" end-line="22.44">[35] “Dogs, did you think that I should not
come back from the district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of the Trojans?
You have wasted my substance, have forced my women
servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife
while I was still living. You have feared neither
the gods [40] nor that there would be
future <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nemesis </foreign>from men, and now you shall
die.” They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and
every man looked round about to see where he might
flee for safety, but Eurymakhos alone spoke.</p>
<p n="875" start-line="22.45" end-line="22.59">[45] “If you are Odysseus,” said he, “then what
you have said is just. We have done much wrong on
your lands and in your house. But Antinoos, who
was the head and front of the guilty [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>], lies low
already. It was all his doing. [50] It was not
that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so
much care about that; what he wanted was something
quite different, and Zeus, son of Kronos, has not
granted it to him; he wanted to kill your son and
to be chief man in strong-founded Ithaca. Now,
therefore, that he has met the death which was his
due, spare the lives [55] of your people. We will
make everything good among ourselves in the
district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], and pay you in full for all
that we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall
pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will keep
on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is
softened. Until we have done this no one can
complain of your being enraged against us.”</p>
<p n="876" start-line="22.60" end-line="22.67">[60] Resourceful Odysseus again glared at him
and said, “Though you should give me all that you
have in the world both now and all that you ever
shall have, I will not stay my hand till I have
paid all of you in full. [65] You must fight, or
flee for your lives; and flee, not a man of you
shall.”</p>
<p n="877" start-line="22.68" end-line="22.69">Their hearts sank as they heard him, but
Eurymakhos again spoke saying:</p>
<p n="878" start-line="22.70" end-line="22.78">[70] “My friends, this man will give us no
quarter. He will stand where he is and shoot us
down till he has killed every man among us. Let us
then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the
tables to shield you [75] from his arrows. Let us
have at him with a rush, to drive him from the
pavement and doorway: we can then get through into
the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon
stay his shooting.”</p>
<p n="879" start-line="22.79" end-line="22.88">As he spoke he drew his keen blade [80] of
bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with a loud
cry sprang towards Odysseus, but noble Odysseus
instantly shot an arrow into his breast that
caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his
liver. He dropped his sword and fell [85] doubled
up over his table. The cup and all the meats went
over on to the ground as he smote the earth with
his forehead in the agonies of death, and he
kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were
closed in darkness.</p>
<p n="880" start-line="22.89" end-line="22.100">Then Amphinomos drew his sword [90] and made
straight at glorious Odysseus to try and get him
away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick
for him, and struck him from behind; the spear
caught him between the shoulders and went right
through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the
ground and struck the earth with his forehead.
[95] Then Telemachus sprang away from him, leaving
his spear still in the body, for he feared that if
he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans
might come up and hack at him with his sword, or
knock him down, so he set off at a run, and
immediately was at his father’s side. [100] Then
he said:</p>
<p n="881" start-line="22.101" end-line="22.104">“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears,
and a brass helmet for your temples. I will arm
myself as well, and will bring other armor for the
swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be
armed.”</p>
<p n="882" start-line="22.105" end-line="22.107">[105] “Run and fetch them,” answered
resourceful Odysseus, “while my arrows hold out,
or when I am alone they may get me away from the
door.”</p>
<p n="883" start-line="22.108" end-line="22.125">Telemachus did as his father said, and went off
to the store room [110] where the armor was kept.
He chose four shields, eight spears, and four
brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought
them with all speed to his father, and armed
himself first, while the stockman and the
swineherd also put on [115] their armor, and took
their places near resourceful Odysseus. Meanwhile
Odysseus, as long as his arrows lasted, had been
shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell
thick on one another: when his arrows gave out,
[120] he set the bow to stand against the end wall
of the house by the door post, and hung a shield
four hides thick about his shoulders; on his
comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a
crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above
it, [125] and he grasped two terrifying
bronze-shod spears.</p>
<p n="884" start-line="22.126" end-line="22.134">Now there was a trap door on the wall, while at
one end of the pavement there was an exit leading
to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a
well-made door. Odysseus told noble Philoitios to
stand [130] by this door and guard it, for only
one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaos
shouted out, “Cannot some one go up to the trap
door and tell the people what is going on? Help
would come at once, and we should soon make an end
of this man and his shooting.”</p>
<p n="885" start-line="22.135" end-line="22.141">[135] “This may not be, illustrious Agelaos,”
answered Melanthios the goatherd, “the mouth of
the narrow passage is dangerously near the
entrance to the outer court. One brave man could
prevent any number from getting in. But I know
what I will do, I will bring you arms from the
store room, [140] for I am sure it is there that
Odysseus and his son have put them.”</p>
<p n="886" start-line="22.142" end-line="22.152">Then the goatherd Melanthios went by back
passages to the store room of Odysseus’ house.
There he chose twelve shields, with as many [145]
helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast
as he could to give them to the suitors. Odysseus’
heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors
putting on their armor and brandishing their
spears. He saw the greatness of the danger, [150]
and said to Telemachus, “Some one of the women
inside is helping the suitors against us, or it
may be Melanthios.”</p>
<p n="887" start-line="22.153" end-line="22.159">The spirited Telemachus answered, “The one who
is responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aitios</foreign>], father, is I, and I alone;
[155] I left the store room door open, and they
have kept a sharper look out than I have. Go,
Eumaios, put the door to, and see whether it is
one of the women who is doing this, or whether, as
I suspect, it is Melanthios, the son of
Dolios.”</p>
<p n="888" start-line="22.160" end-line="22.169">[160] Thus did they converse. Meanwhile
Melanthios was again going to the store room to
fetch more armor, but the swineherd saw him and
said to Odysseus who was beside him, “Resourceful
Odysseus, noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus,
[165] it is that scoundrel Melanthios, just as we
suspected, who is going to the store room. Say,
shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him,
or shall I bring him here that you may take your
own revenge for all the many wrongs that he has
done in your house?”</p>
<p n="889" start-line="22.170" end-line="22.177">[170] Resourceful Odysseus answered,
“Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in
check, no matter what they do; go back both of you
and bind Melanthios’ hands and feet behind him.
Throw him into the store room and make the door
fast behind you; [175] then fasten a noose about
his body, and string him close up to the rafters
from a high bearing-post, that he may linger on in
an agony.”</p>
<p n="890" start-line="22.178" end-line="22.199">Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had
said; they went to the store room, which they
entered before Melanthios saw them, [180] for he
was busy searching for arms in the innermost part
of the room, so the two took their stand on either
side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthios
the goatherd came out with a helmet in one hand,
and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, [185]
which had been borne by the hero Laertes when he
was young, but which had been long since thrown
aside, and the straps had become unsewn; on this
the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair,
and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent
his hands and feet well behind his back, [190] and
bound them tight with a painful bond as enduring
Odysseus, son of Laertes, had told them; then they
fastened a noose about his body and strung him up
from a high pillar till he was close up to the
rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O
swineherd Eumaios, saying, [195] “Melanthios, you
will pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve.
You will know very well when morning comes from
the streams of Okeanos, and it is time for you to
be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast
on.”</p>
<p n="891" start-line="22.200" end-line="22.209">[200] There, then, they left him in very cruel
bondage, and having put on their armor they closed
the door behind them and went back to take their
places by the side of resourceful Odysseus;
whereon the four men stood in the hall, fierce and
full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the
body of the court were still both brave and many.
[205] Then Zeus’ daughter Athena came up to them,
having assumed the voice and form of Mentor.
Odysseus was glad when he saw her and said,
“Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your
old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done
you. Besides, you are my age-mate.”</p>
<p n="892" start-line="22.210" end-line="22.223">[210] But all the time he felt sure it was
Athena, leader of armies, and the suitors from the
other side raised an uproar when they saw her.
Agelaos, son of Damastor, was the first to
reproach her. “Mentor,” he cried, “do not let
Odysseus beguile you into siding with him and
fighting the suitors. [215] This is what we will
do [= “this will be our <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>noos</foreign>”]: when we have killed these
people, father and son, we will kill you too. You
shall pay for it with your head, and when we have
killed you, [220] we will take all you have,
indoors or out, and bring it together with
Odysseus’ property; we will not let your sons live
in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your
widow continue to live in the city of Ithaca.”</p>
<p n="893" start-line="22.224" end-line="22.235">This made Athena still more furious, [225] so
she scolded Odysseus very angrily. <seg
rend="subscript">226</seg> “no longer, Odysseus,
do you have your old power [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>] and strength
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">alkē</foreign>] as when
you fought for nine long years among the Trojans
about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man
in those days, [230] and it was through your
stratagem that Priam’s city was taken. How comes
it that you are so lamentably less valiant now
that you are on your own ground, face to face with
the suitors in your own house? Come on, my good
man, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of
Alkinoos, shall fight your foes [235] and requite
your kindnesses conferred upon him.”</p>
<p n="894" start-line="22.236" end-line="22.240">But she would not give him full victory as yet,
for she wished still further to prove his own
prowess and that of his brave son, [240] so she
flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the
hall and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.</p>
<p n="895" start-line="22.241" end-line="22.254">Meanwhile Agelaos, son of Damastor, Eurynomos,
Amphimedon, Demoptolemos, Peisandros, and
high-spirited Polybos, son of Polyktor, bore the
brunt of the fight upon the suitors’ side; of all
those who were still fighting for their lives
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhai</foreign>],
[245] they were by far the most distinguished in
their efforts [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>], for the others had already
fallen under the arrows of Odysseus. Agelaos
shouted to them and said, “My friends, he will
soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away
after having done nothing for him but brag. [250]
They are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not
aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your
spears first, and see if you cannot cover
yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has
fallen we need not be uneasy about the
others.”</p>
<p n="896" start-line="22.255" end-line="22.264">[255] They threw their spears as he bade them,
but Athena made them all of no effect. One hit the
door post; another went against the door; the
pointed shaft of another struck the wall; [260]
and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of
the suitors much-enduring great Odysseus said to
his own men, “My friends, I should say we too had
better let drive into the middle of them, or they
will crown all the harm they have done us by
killing us outright.”</p>
<p n="897" start-line="22.265" end-line="22.291">[265] They therefore aimed straight in front of
them and threw their spears. Odysseus killed
Demoptolemos, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaios Elatos
the swineherd while the stockman killed
Peisandros. These all bit the dust, [270] and as
the others drew back into a corner Odysseus and
his men rushed forward and regained their spears
by drawing them from the bodies of the dead. The
suitors now aimed a second time, but again Athena
made their weapons for the most part without
effect. One hit a bearing-post [275] of the hall;
another went against the door; while the pointed
shaft of another struck the wall. Still,
Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from
off Telemachus’ wrist, and Ktesippos managed to
graze Eumaios’ [280] shoulder above his shield;
but the spear went on and fell to the ground. Then
Odysseus and his men let drive into the crowd of
suitors. Odysseus, stormer of cities, hit
Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaios hit
Polybos. [285] After this the stockman hit
Ktesippos in the breast, and taunted him saying,
“Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so
foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let
the gods direct your speech, for they are far
stronger than men. [290] I make you a present of
this advice to repay you for the foot which you
gave godlike Odysseus when he was begging about in
his own house.”</p>
<p n="898" start-line="22.292" end-line="22.309">Thus spoke the stockman, and Odysseus struck
the son of Damastor with a spear in close fight,
while Telemachus hit Leokritos, son of Euenor,
[295] in the belly, and the dart went clean
through him, so that he fell forward full on his
face upon the ground. Then Athena from her seat on
the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the
hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the
other end of the court like a herd of cattle [300]
maddened by the gadfly in the season [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] of early summer
when the days are at their longest. As
eagle-beaked, crooked-taloned vultures from the
mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that
cower in flocks upon the ground, [305] and kill
them, for they cannot either fight or flee, and
lookers-on enjoy the sport—even so did Odysseus
and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them
on every side. They made a horrible groaning as
their brains were being battered in, and the
ground seethed with their blood.</p>
<p n="899" start-line="22.310" end-line="22.319">[310] Leiodes then caught the knees of Odysseus
and said, “Odysseus I beseech you have mercy upon
me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women
in your house either in word or deed, [315] and I
tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they
would not listen, and now they are paying for
their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if
you kill me, I shall die without having done
anything to deserve it, and shall have got no
thanks [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>]
for all the good that I did.”</p>
<p n="900" start-line="22.320" end-line="22.325">[320] Resourceful Odysseus looked sternly at
him and answered, “If you were their sacrificing
priest, you must have prayed many a time that it
might be long before my homecoming [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], and that you
might marry my wife [325] and have children by
her. Therefore you shall die.”</p>
<p n="901" start-line="22.326" end-line="22.329">With these words he picked up the sword that
Agelaos had dropped when he was being killed, and
which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck
Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head
fell rolling in the dust while he was yet
speaking.</p>
<p n="902" start-line="22.330" end-line="22.353">[330] The minstrel Phemios, son of Terpes—he
who had been forced by the suitors to sing to
them—now tried to save his life. He was standing
near towards the trap door, and held his lyre in
his hand. He did not know whether to flee out of
the hall and sit down by the altar of [335] Zeus
that was in the outer court, and on which both
Laertes and Odysseus had offered up the thigh
bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight up
to Odysseus and embrace his knees, but in the end
he thought it best to embrace Odysseus’ knees.
[340] So he laid his lyre on the ground between
the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat; then
going up to Odysseus he caught hold of his knees
and said, “Odysseus, I beseech you have mercy on
me and spare me. [345] You will feel grief
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] for it
afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both
for gods and men as I can. I am self-taught, and
the god implanted every kind of lay in my <foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">phrenes</foreign>. I would sing to
you as though you were a god, do not therefore be
in such a hurry to cut my head off. [350] Your own
son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want
to frequent your house and sing to the suitors
after their meals, but they were too many and too
strong for me, so they made me.”</p>
<p n="903" start-line="22.354" end-line="22.360">The hallowed prince Telemachus heard him, [355]
and at once went up to his father. “Hold!” he
cried, “the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and
we will spare Medon, our herald, too, who was
always good to me when I was a boy, unless
Philoitios or Eumaios has already killed him,
[360] or he has fallen in your way when you were
raging about the court.”</p>
<p n="904" start-line="22.361" end-line="22.370">Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he
was crouching under a seat beneath which he had
hidden by covering himself up with a freshly
flayed heifer’s hide, so he threw off the hide,
went up to Telemachus, [365] and laid hold of his
knees. “Here I am, my dear sir,” said he, “stay
your hand therefore, and tell your father, or he
will kill me in his rage against the suitors [370]
for having wasted his substance and been so
foolishly disrespectful to yourself.”</p>
<p n="905" start-line="22.371" end-line="22.377">Resourceful Odysseus smiled at him and
answered, “Fear not; Telemachus has saved your
life, that you may know in future, and tell other
people, how greatly better good deeds prosper than
evil ones. [375] Go, therefore, outside the halls
into the outer court, and be out of the way of the
slaughter—you and the bard—while I finish my work
here inside.”</p>
<p n="906" start-line="22.378" end-line="22.389">The pair went into the outer court as fast as
they could, and sat down [380] by Zeus’ great
altar, looking fearfully round, and still
expecting that they would be killed. Then Odysseus
searched the whole court carefully over, to see if
anyone had managed to hide himself and was still
living, but he found them all lying in the dust
and weltering in their blood. They were like
fishes which fishermen [385] have netted out of
the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping
for water till the heat of the sun makes an end of
them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled
up one against the other.</p>
<p n="907" start-line="22.390" end-line="22.392">[390] Then resourceful Odysseus said to
Telemachus, “Call nurse Eurykleia; I have
something to say to her.”</p>
<p n="908" start-line="22.393" end-line="22.397">Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the
women’s room. [395] “Make haste,” said he, “you
old woman who have been set over all the other
women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes
to speak to you.”</p>
<p n="909" start-line="22.398" end-line="22.418">When Eurykleia heard this she unfastened the
door of the women’s room [400] and came out,
following Telemachus. She found Odysseus among the
corpses bespattered with blood and filth like a
lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his
breast and both his cheeks are [405] all bloody,
so that he is a fearful sight; even so was
Odysseus besmirched from head to foot with gore.
When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity
of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy,
for she saw that a great deed had been done; but
Odysseus checked her, [410] “Old woman,” said he,
“rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not
make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to
vaunt over dead men. Heaven’s doom and their own
evil deeds have brought these men to destruction,
for they respected no man in the whole world,
[415] neither rich nor poor, who came near them,
and they have come to a bad end as a punishment
for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell
me which of the women in the house have
misconducted themselves, and who are
innocent.”</p>
<p n="910" start-line="22.419" end-line="22.429">[420] “I will tell you the truth [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">alētheia</foreign>], my son,”
answered Eurykleia. “There are fifty women in the
house whom we teach to do things, such as carding
wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these,
twelve in all have misbehaved, [425] and have been
wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope.
They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he
has only lately grown and his mother never
permitted him to give orders to the female
servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your
wife all that has happened, for some god has been
sending her to sleep.”</p>
<p n="911" start-line="22.430" end-line="22.432">[430] “Do not wake her yet,” answered
resourceful Odysseus, “but tell the women who have
misconducted themselves to come to me.”</p>
<p n="912" start-line="22.433" end-line="22.445">Eurykleia left the hall to tell the women, and
make them come to Odysseus; [435] in the meantime
he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the
swineherd. “Begin,” said he, “to remove the dead,
and make the women help you. Then, get sponges and
clean water to swill down the tables and seats.
[440] When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole
hall, take the women into the space between the
domed room and the wall of the outer court, and
run them through with your swords till they are
quite dead, and have forgotten all about love
[445] and the way in which they used to lie in
secret with the suitors.”</p>
<p n="913" start-line="22.446" end-line="22.464">Then the women came down in a body, weeping and
wailing bitterly. First they carried the dead
bodies out, [450] and propped them up against one
another in the gatehouse. Odysseus ordered them
about and made them do their work quickly, so they
had to carry the bodies out. When they had done
this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with
sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two
others [455] shoveled up the blood and dirt from
the ground, and the women carried it all away and
put it out of doors. Then when they had made the
whole place quite clean and orderly, they took the
women out and [460] hemmed them in the narrow
space between the wall of the domed room and that
of the yard, so that they could not get away: and
the spirited Telemachus said to the other two, “I
shall not let these women die a clean death, for
they were insolent to me and my mother, and used
to sleep with the suitors.”</p>
<p n="914" start-line="22.465" end-line="22.473">[465] So saying he made a ship’s cable fast to
one of the bearing-posts that supported the roof
of the domed room, and secured it all around the
building, at a good height, lest any of the
women’s feet should touch the ground; and as
thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been
set for them in a thicket just as they were
getting to their nest, and a terrifying fate
awaits them, [470] even so did the women have to
put their heads in nooses one after the other and
die most miserably. Their feet moved convulsively
for a while, but not for very long.</p>
<p n="915" start-line="22.474" end-line="22.477">As for Melanthios, they took him through the
hall into the inner court. There they cut off his
nose and his ears; [475] they drew out his vitals
and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their
fury they cut off his hands and his feet.</p>
<p n="916" start-line="22.478" end-line="22.484">When they had done this they washed their hands
and feet and went back into the house, for all was
now over; and Odysseus said to the dear old nurse
Eurykleia, [480] “Bring me sulfur, which cleanses
all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn
it, and purify the halls. Go, moreover, and tell
Penelope to come here with her attendants, and
also all the maid servants that are in the
house.”</p>
<p n="917" start-line="22.485" end-line="22.489">[485] “All that you have said is true,”
answered beloved Eurykleia, “but let me bring you
some clean clothes—a khiton and cloak. Do not keep
these rags on your back any longer. It is not
right.”</p>
<p n="918" start-line="22.490" end-line="22.491">[490] “First light me a fire,” replied
reasourceful Odysseus.</p>
<p n="919" start-line="22.492" end-line="22.501">She brought the fire and sulfur, as he had
bidden her, and Odysseus thoroughly purified the
halls and both the inner and outer courts. [495]
Then she went inside to call the women and tell
them what had happened; whereon they came from
their apartment with torches in their hands, and
pressed round Odysseus to embrace him, kissing his
head and shoulders [500] and taking hold of his
hands. It made him feel as if he should like to
weep, for he remembered every one of them.</p>

<head>Rhapsody 23</head>
<p n="920" start-line="23.1" end-line="23.9" rend="no-indent">Eurykleia now went upstairs
laughing to tell her mistress that her dear
husband had come home. Her aged knees became young
again and her feet were nimble for joy as she went
up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak
to her. “Wake up Penelope, my dear child,” she
exclaimed, “and see with your own eyes something
that you have been wanting this long time past.
Odysseus has at last indeed come home again, and
has killed the suitors who were giving so much
trouble in his house, eating up his estate and
ill-treating his son.”</p>
<p n="921" start-line="23.10" end-line="23.24">[10] “My good nurse,” answered circumspect
Penelope, “you must be mad. The gods sometimes
send some very sensible people out of their minds,
and make foolish people become sensible. This is
what they must have been doing to you; for you
always used to be a reasonable person. [15] Why
should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough
already—talking such nonsense, and waking me up
out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of
my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so
soundly from the day my poor husband went to that
city with the ill-omened name. [20] Go back again
into the women’s room; if it had been any one
else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd
news I should have sent her away with a severe
scolding. As it is, your age shall protect
you.”</p>
<p n="922" start-line="23.25" end-line="23.31">[25] “My dear child,” answered beloved
Eurykleia, “I am not mocking you. It is quite true
as I tell you that Odysseus is come home again. He
was the stranger whom they all kept on treating so
badly in the hall. Telemachus knew all the time
that he was come back, [30] but kept his father’s
secret that he might have his revenge on all these
wicked people.”</p>
<p n="923" start-line="23.32" end-line="23.38">Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw
her arms round Eurykleia, and wept for joy. [35]
“But my dear nurse,” said she, “explain this to
me; if he has really come home as you say, how did
he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single
handed, seeing what a number of them there always
were?”</p>
<p n="924" start-line="23.39" end-line="23.57">[40] “I was not there,” answered beloved
Eurykleia, “and do not know; I only heard them
groaning while they were being killed. We sat
crouching and huddled up in a corner of the
women’s room with the doors closed, till your son
came to fetch me because his father sent him. [45]
Then I found Odysseus standing over the corpses
that were lying on the ground all round him, one
on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if
you could have seen him standing there all
bespattered with blood and filth, and looking just
like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up
in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, [50]
and Odysseus has lit a great fire to purify the
house with sulfur. He has sent me to call you, so
come with me that you may both be happy together
after all; for now at last the desire of your
heart has been fulfilled; [55] your husband is
come home to find both wife and son alive and
well, and to take his revenge in his own house on
the suitors who behaved so badly to him.”</p>
<p n="925" start-line="23.58" end-line="23.68">“My dear nurse,” said circumspect Penelope, “do
not exult too confidently over all this. You know
[60] how delighted every one would be to see
Odysseus come home—more particularly myself, and
the son who has been born to both of us; but what
you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god
who is angry with the suitors for their great
wickedness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hubris</foreign>], and has made an end of them;
[65] for they respected no man in the whole world,
neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and
they have come to a bad end in consequence of
their iniquity. Odysseus is dead far away from the
Achaean land; he will never have his homecoming
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="926" start-line="23.69" end-line="23.79">Then beloved nurse Eurykleia said, [70] “My
child, what are you talking about? But you were
all hard of belief and have made up your mind that
your husband is never coming, although he is in
the house and by his own fire side at this very
moment. Besides I can give you another sign
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>]; when I
was washing him I perceived the scar which the
wild boar gave him, [75] and I wanted to tell you
about it, but in his wisdom [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] he would not let
me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come
with me and I will make this bargain with you—if I
am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the
cruelest death you can think of.”</p>
<p n="927" start-line="23.80" end-line="23.84">[80] “My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “no matter
who you are, you cannot really fathom the counsels
of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of
my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors,
and the man who has killed them.”</p>
<p n="928" start-line="23.85" end-line="23.95">[85] Then she came down from her upper room,
and while doing so she considered whether she
should keep at a distance from her husband and
question him, or whether she should at once go up
to him and embrace him. When, however, she had
crossed the stone floor of the hall, she sat down
opposite Odysseus by the fire, [90] against the
wall at right angles to that by which she had
entered, while Odysseus sat near one of the
bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and
waiting to see what his wife would say to him when
she saw him. For a long time she sat silent and as
one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked
him full in the face, [95] but then again
directly, she was misled by his shabby clothes and
failed to recognize him, till Telemachus began to
reproach her and said:</p>
<p n="929" start-line="23.96" end-line="23.103">“Mother—but you are so hard that I cannot call
you by such a name—why do you keep away from my
father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side
and begin talking to him and asking him questions?
[100] No other woman could bear to keep away from
her husband when he had come back to her after
twenty years of absence, and after having gone
through so much; but your heart always was as hard
as a stone.”</p>
<p n="930" start-line="23.104" end-line="23.110">Circumspect Penelope answered, [105] “My son, I
am so lost in astonishment that I can find no
words in which either to ask questions or to
answer them. I cannot even look him straight in
the face. Still, if he really is Odysseus come
back to his own home again, we shall get to
understand one another better by and by, for there
are signs [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sēmata</foreign>] [110] with which we two are
alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all
others.”</p>
<p n="931" start-line="23.111" end-line="23.122">Much-enduring noble Odysseus smiled at this,
and said to Telemachus, “Let your mother put me to
any proof she likes; she will make up her mind
about it presently. [115] She rejects me for the
moment and believes me to be somebody else,
because I am covered with dirt and have such bad
clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had
better do next. When one man has killed another in
a district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>], even though he was not one who
would leave many friends to take up his quarrel,
the man who has killed him [120] must still say
good bye to his friends and flee the country;
whereas we have been killing the stay of a whole
city, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would
have you consider this matter.”</p>
<p n="932" start-line="23.123" end-line="23.128">“Look to it yourself, father,” answered the
spirited Telemachus, “for they say [125] you are
the wisest counselor in the world, and that there
is no other mortal man who can compare with you.
We will follow you with right good will, nor shall
you find us fail you in so far as our strength
holds out.”</p>
<p n="933" start-line="23.129" end-line="23.140">[130] “I will say what I think will be best,”
answered resourceful Odysseus. “First wash and put
your khitons on; tell the maids also to go to
their own room and dress; Phemios shall then
strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if
people [135] outside hear, or any of the
neighbors, or some one going along the street
happens to notice it, they may think there is a
wedding in the house, and no rumors [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] about the death
of the suitors will get about in the town, before
we can escape to the woods upon my own land. Once
there, [140] we will settle which of the courses
of action [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kerdos</foreign>] the gods grant us shall seem
wisest.”</p>
<p n="934" start-line="23.141" end-line="23.151">Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had
said. First they washed and put their khitons on,
while the women got ready. Then Phemios took his
lyre and set them all longing [145] for sweet song
and stately dance. The house re-echoed with the
sound of men and women dancing, and the people
outside said, “I suppose the queen has been
getting married at last. [150] She ought to be
ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect
her husband’s property until he comes home.”</p>
<p n="935" start-line="23.152" end-line="23.172">This was what they said, but they did not know
what it was that had been happening. The upper
servant, Eurynome, washed and anointed
great-hearted Odysseus in his own house [155] and
gave him a khiton and cloak, while Athena made him
look taller and stronger than before; she also
made the hair grow thick on the top of his head,
and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she
shed <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kharis</foreign> about his head and shoulders
just as a skillful workman [160] who has studied
art of all kinds under Hephaistos or Athena—and
his work is full of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>kharis</foreign>—enriches a piece of silver plate
by gilding it. <seg rend="subscript">163</seg> He
emerged from the bathtub [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>asaminthos</foreign>], looking like [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">homoios</foreign>] the immortals
in size, and sat down [165] opposite his wife on
the seat he had left. “My dear,” said he, “the
gods have endowed you with a heart more unyielding
than woman ever yet had. No other woman could bear
to keep away from her husband [170] when he had
come back to her after twenty years of absence,
and after having gone through so much. But come,
nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone,
for this woman has a heart as hard as iron.”</p>
<p n="936" start-line="23.173" end-line="23.180">“My dear,” answered circumspect Penelope, “I
have no wish to set myself up, nor to depreciate
you; [175] but I am not struck by your appearance,
for I very well remember what kind of a man you
were when you set sail from Ithaca. Nevertheless,
Eurykleia, take his bed outside the bed chamber
that he himself built. Bring the bed outside this
room, and put bedding upon it [180] with fleeces,
good coverlets, and blankets.”</p>
<p n="937" start-line="23.181" end-line="23.204">She said this to try him, but Odysseus was very
angry and said, “Wife, I am much displeased at
what you have just been saying. Who has been
taking my bed from the place in which I left it?
He must have found it a hard task, [185] no matter
how skilled a workman he was, unless some god came
and helped him to shift it. There is no man
living, however strong and in his prime, who could
move it from its place. For it was wrought to be a
great sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sēma</foreign>]; it is a marvelous curiosity
which I made with my very own hands. [190] There
was a young olive growing within the precincts of
the house, in full vigor, and about as thick as a
bearing-post. I built my room round this with
strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,
and I made the doors strong and well-fitting.
[195] Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive
tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed
roughly from the root upwards and then worked with
carpenter’s tools well and skillfully,
straightening my work by drawing a line on the
wood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored
a hole down the middle, and made it the
center-post of my bed, at which I worked till I
had finished it, [200] inlaying it with gold and
silver; after this I stretched a hide of crimson
leather from one side of it to the other. So you
see I know all about this sign [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>], and I desire to
learn whether it is still there, or whether any
one has been removing it by cutting down the olive
tree at its roots.”</p>
<p n="938" start-line="23.205" end-line="23.230">[205] When she heard the sure signs [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">sēmata</foreign>] Odysseus now
gave her, she fairly broke down. She flew weeping
to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and
kissed him. “Do not be angry with me Odysseus,”
she cried, [210] “you, who are the wisest of
humankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven
has denied us the happiness of spending our youth,
and of growing old, together; do not then be
aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace
you thus as soon as I saw you. [215] I have been
shuddering all the time through fear that someone
might come here and deceive me with a lying story;
for there are many people who plan wicked schemes
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>]. Zeus’
daughter, Helen of Argos, would never have yielded
herself to a man from a foreign country, [220] if
she had known that the warlike sons of Achaeans
would come after her and bring her back. Heaven
put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no
thought to that transgression [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>], which has been the
source of all our sorrows [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]. [225] Now,
however, that you have convinced me by showing
that you know all the signs [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">sēmata</foreign>] of our bed
(which no human being has ever seen but you and I
and a single maid servant, the daughter of Aktor,
who was given me by my father on my marriage, and
who keeps the doors of our room), [230] hard of
belief though I have been, I can mistrust no
longer.”</p>
<p n="939" start-line="23.231" end-line="23.246">Then Odysseus in his turn melted, and wept as
he clasped his dear and faithful wife to his
bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who
are swimming towards the shore, when Poseidon has
wrecked their ship [235] with the fury of his
winds and waves—a few alone reach the land, and
these, covered with brine, are thankful when they
find themselves on firm ground and out of
danger—even so was her husband welcome to her as
she looked upon him, [240] and she could not tear
her two fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they
would have gone on indulging their sorrow till
rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not the
owl-vision goddess Athena determined otherwise,
and held night back in the far west, while she
would not suffer Dawn of the golden throne to
leave Okeanos, [245] nor to yoke <seg
rend="subscript">246</seg> Lampos and Phaethōn,
who are the horses that pull Ēōs to break the day
upon humankind.</p>
<p n="940" start-line="23.247" end-line="23.255">At last, however, Odysseus said, “Wife, we have
not yet reached the end of our trials [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthloi</foreign>]. I have an
unknown amount of toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ponos</foreign>] still to undergo. [250] It is
long and difficult, but I must go through with it,
for thus the spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē</foreign>] of Teiresias prophesied
concerning me, on the day when I went down into
Hādēs to ask about my return [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] and that of my
companions. But now let us go to bed, that we may
[255] lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of
sleep.”</p>
<p n="941" start-line="23.256" end-line="23.262">“You shall go to bed as soon as you please,”
replied circumspect Penelope, “now that the gods
have sent you home to your own good house and to
your country. [260] But as the gods have put it in
your mind to speak of it, tell me about the task
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>] that
lies before you. I shall have to hear about it
later, so it is better that I should be told at
once.”</p>
<p n="942" start-line="23.263" end-line="23.284">“My dear,” answered resourceful Odysseus, “why
should you press me [265] to tell you? <seg
rend="subscript">266</seg> Your heart [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] will not be
pleased, nor am I <seg rend="subscript"
>267</seg> pleased [by the telling of these
adventures], since he [= Teiresias] instructed me
to go to very many cities of mortals <seg
rend="subscript">268</seg>while holding my
well-made oar in my hands, till I came to a
country where the people have never heard [270] of
the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food.
They know nothing about ships, nor oars that are
as the wings of a ship. He gave me this certain
sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>]
which I will not hide from you. He said that a
wayfarer should meet me and ask me [275] whether
it was a winnowing shovel that I had on my
shoulder. Then, I was to fix my oar in the ground
and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to
Poseidon; after which I was to go home and offer
hecatombs [280] to all the gods in the sky, one
after the other. As for myself, he said that death
should come to me from the sea, and that my life
should ebb away very gently when I was full of
years and peace of mind, and my people should be
prosperous [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbios</foreign>]. All this, he said, should
surely come to pass.”</p>
<p n="943" start-line="23.285" end-line="23.287">[285] And circumspect Penelope said, “If the
gods are going to grant you a happier time in your
old age, you may hope then to have some respite
from misfortune.”</p>
<p n="944" start-line="23.288" end-line="23.309">Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and
the nurse took torches and made the bed ready
[290] with soft coverlets; as soon as they had
laid them, the nurse went back into the house to
go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman,
Eurynome, to show Odysseus and Penelope to bed by
torch light. [295] When she had conducted them to
their room she went back, and they then came
joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.
Telemachus, Philoitios, and the swineherd now left
off dancing, and made the women leave off also.
They then laid themselves down to sleep in the
halls. [300] When Odysseus and Penelope had had
their fill of love they fell talking with one
another. She, Penelope, shining among women, told
him how much she had to bear in seeing the house
filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had
killed so many sheep and oxen on her account,
[305] and had drunk so many casks of wine.
Odysseus in his turn told her what he had
suffered, and how much trouble he had himself
given to other people. He told her everything, and
she was so delighted to listen that she never went
to sleep till he had ended his whole story.</p>
<p n="945" start-line="23.310" end-line="23.343">[310] He began with his victory over the
Kikones, and how he thence reached the fertile
land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about
the Cyclops and how he had punished him for having
so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how he
then went on to Aiolos, who received him
hospitably [315] and furthered him on his way, but
even so he was not to reach home, for a gust of
wind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>thuella</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
>317</seg> carried him, heavily groaning, over the
fishy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ikhthuoeis</foreign>] sea [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>]; how he went on
to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the
people destroyed all his ships with their crews,
[320] save himself and his own ship only. Then he
told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he
sailed to the chill house of Hādēs, to consult the
spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>]
of the Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he saw
his old comrades in arms, [325] and his mother who
bore him and brought him up when he was a child;
how he then heard the wondrous singing of the
Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and
terrifying Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man
had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then
ate the cattle of the sun-god, [330] and how Zeus
therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts,
so that all his men perished together, himself
alone being left alive; how at last he reached the
Ogygian island and the nymph Kalypsō, who kept him
there [335] in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him
to marry her, in which case she intended making
him immortal so that he should never grow old, but
she could not persuade him to let her do so; and
how after much suffering he had found his way to
the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he
had been a god, and sent him [340] back in a ship
to his own country after having given him gold,
bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was
the last thing about which he told her, for here a
deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden
of his sorrows.</p>
<p n="946" start-line="23.344" end-line="23.365">Then the owl-vision goddess Athena thought of
another matter. [345] When she thought that
Odysseus had had enough both of his wife and of
repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of
Okeanos that she might shed light upon humankind.
Then, Odysseus rose from his comfortable bed and
said to Penelope, [350] “Wife, we have both of us
had our full share of trials [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>], you, here, in
lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented
from homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>nostos</foreign>] though I was longing all the
time to do so. Now, however, that we have at last
come together, [355] take care of the property
that is in the house. As for the sheep and goats
which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take
many myself by force from other people, and will
compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till
they shall have filled all my yards. I am now
going to the wooded lands out in the country [360]
to see my father who has so long been grieved on
my account, and to yourself I will give these
instructions, though you have little need of them.
At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have
been killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore,
[365] and stay there with your women. See nobody
and ask no questions.”</p>
<p n="947" start-line="23.366" end-line="23.372">As he spoke he girded on his armor. Then he
roused Telemachus, Philoitios, and Eumaios, and
told them all to put on their armor also. This
they did, and armed themselves. When they had done
so, [370] they opened the gates and sallied forth,
Odysseus leading the way. It was now daylight, but
Athena nevertheless concealed them in darkness and
led them quickly out of the town.</p>

<head>Rhapsody 24</head>
<p n="948" start-line="24.1" end-line="24.14" rend="no-indent">Then Hermes of Cyllene
summoned the spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhai</foreign>] of the suitors, and in his
hand he held the fair golden wand with which he
seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he
pleases; [5] with this he roused the spirits and
led them, while they followed gibbering behind
him. As bats fly squeaking in the hollow of some
great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the
cluster in which they hang, even so did the
spirits squeak as Hermes [10] the healer of sorrow
led them down into the dark abode of death. When
they had passed the waters of Okeanos and the Rock
Leukas, they came to the Gates of the Sun and the
District [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>dēmos</foreign>] of Dreams, whereon they reached
the Meadow of Asphodel where dwell the spirits and
shadows of them that can labor no more.</p>
<p n="949" start-line="24.15" end-line="24.21">[15] Here they found the spirit [<foreign

of Peleus, with those of Patroklos, Antilokhos,
and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of
all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.
They gathered round the spirit of the son of
Peleus, [20] and the spirit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of Agamemnon,
the son of Atreus, joined them, sorrowing
bitterly.</p>
<p n="950" start-line="24.22" end-line="24.23">Round him were gathered also the spirits of
those who had perished with him in the house of
Aegisthus; and the spirit [<foreign

spoke first.</p>
<p n="951" start-line="24.24" end-line="24.34">“Son of Atreus,” it said, “we used to say that
Zeus had loved you [25] better from first to last
than any other hero, for you were captain over
many and brave men, when we were all fighting
together in the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon
you all too early. [30] Better for you had you
fallen in the Trojan <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

for the Achaeans would have built a mound over
your ashes, and your son would have been heir to

whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most
miserable end.”</p>
<p n="952" start-line="24.35" end-line="24.56">[35] Then the spirit of the son of Atreus
answered him: <seg rend="subscript">36</seg> “O
you blessed [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

Achilles, <seg rend="subscript">37</seg> you who

over you [= your corpse]. There you were, lying in
a swirl of dust. [40] You lay there so huge in all
your hugeness, no longer thinking about your feats
of charioteering, heedless now of your chivalry.
We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor
should we ever have left off if Zeus had not sent
a stormy wind to stay us. <seg rend="subscript"
>43</seg> Then, when we had taken you [= your
corpse] to the ships, out of the battlezone, <seg

water and with oil. And, crying over you, many
tears <seg rend="subscript">46</seg> did the

their hair. <seg rend="subscript">47</seg> Your

soon as she heard, and the sound of a great
wailing went forth over the sea, <seg
rend="subscript">49</seg> a sound too wondrous for
words, and all the Achaeans were overcome with
trembling. [50] They would have fled
panic-stricken to their ships had not the wise old
Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them
saying, ‘Hold, Argives, flee not, sons of the
Achaeans, [55] this is his mother coming from the
sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of
her son.’</p>
<p n="953" start-line="24.57" end-line="24.79">Thus he spoke, and the great-hearted Achaeans

they [= the Nereids] clothed you [= the corpse of

The nine Muses also came, all of them, and sang
antiphonally with a beautiful voice, <seg

astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at

who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, [105]

One could select [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

against you when you were at sea, or did your

you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or
while fighting in defense of their wives and city?
Answer my question, for I have been your guest.
[115] Do you not remember how I came to your house
with godlike Menelaos, to persuade Odysseus to
join us with his ships against Troy? It was a

<p n="957" start-line="24.120" end-line="24.148">[120] And the spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē</foreign>] of Amphimedon answered,
“Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I remember
everything that you have said, and will tell you
fully and accurately about the way in which our
end was brought about. [125] Odysseus had been
long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did
not say point blank that she would not marry, nor
yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to
compass our destruction: this, then, was the trick
she played us. She set up a great loom in her room
and began to weave [130] an enormous fine web.
‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Great Odysseus is indeed
dead, still, do not press me to marry again
immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in
needlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed
a shroud for the hero Laertes, against the time
when [135] death shall take him. He is very rich,
and the women of the district [<foreign

is laid out without a shroud.’ This is what she
said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her
working upon her great web all day long, [140] but
at night she would undo it again by torchlight.
She fooled us in this way for three years without
our finding it out, but as time [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] wore on and she
was now in her fourth year, and the waning of
moons and many days had been accomplished, one of
her maids who knew what she was doing told us,
[145] and we caught her in the act of undoing her
work, so she had to finish it whether she would or
not; and when she showed us the robe she had made,
after she had had it washed, its splendor was as
that of the sun or moon.</p>
<p n="958" start-line="24.149" end-line="24.190">Then some malicious superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] conveyed
Odysseus [150] to the upland farm where his
swineherd lives. There presently came also his
son, returning from a voyage to Pylos, and the two
came to the town when they had hatched their plot
for our destruction. [155] Telemachus came first,
and then after him, accompanied by the swineherd,
came Odysseus, clad in rags and leaning on a staff
as though he were some miserable old beggar. He
came so unexpectedly that [160] none of us knew
him, not even the older ones among us, and we
reviled him and threw things at him. He endured
both being struck and insulted without a word,
though he was in his own house; but when the will
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of
aegis-bearing Zeus inspired him, [165] he and
Telemachus took the armor and hid it in an inner
chamber, bolting the doors behind them. Then he
cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a
quantity of iron to be contended for by us
ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of
our end, [170] for not one of us could string the
bow—nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach
the hands of Odysseus, we all of us shouted out
that it should not be given him, no matter what he
might say, [175] but Telemachus insisted on his
having it. When he had got it in his hands he
strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the
iron. Then he stood on the floor of the hall and
poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely
about him. First he killed Antinoos, [180] and
then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his
deadly darts and they fell thick on one another.
It was plain that some one of the gods was helping
them, for they fell upon us with might and main
throughout the halls, and there was a hideous
sound of groaning [185] as our brains were being
battered in, and the ground seethed with our
blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end,
and our bodies are lying still uncared for in the
house of Odysseus, for our friends at home do not
yet know what has happened, so that they cannot
[190] lay us out and wash the black blood from our
wounds, making moan over us according to the
offices due to the departed.”</p>
<p n="959" start-line="24.191" end-line="24.202">The the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>psūkhē</foreign> of the son of Atreus answered
him: <seg rend="subscript">192</seg> “O blessed
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbios</foreign>] son of
Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, <seg
rend="subscript">193</seg> it is truly with great
merit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>]
that you got to have your wife. <seg
rend="subscript">194</seg> For the thinking
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phrenes</foreign>] of
faultless Penelope was sound: [195] she, daughter
of Ikarios, kept Odysseus, well in mind, <seg
rend="subscript">196</seg> that properly-wedded
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kouridios</foreign>]
husband of hers. Thus the glory [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] will never perish
for him, <seg rend="subscript">197</seg> the glory
that comes from his merit [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>], and a song will
be created for earth-bound humans <seg
rend="subscript">198</seg> by the immortals—a song
that brings beautiful and pleasurable recompense
for sensible Penelope <seg rend="subscript"
>199</seg> —unlike the daughter of Tyndareos [=
Clytemnestra], who masterminded evil deeds, [200]
killing her properly-wedded [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">kouridios</foreign>] husband, and
a hateful subject of song <seg rend="subscript"
>201</seg> she will be throughout all humankind,
and she will give a harsh reputation <seg
rend="subscript">202</seg> to women, female
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thēluterai</foreign>]
that they are—even for the kind of woman who does
noble things.”</p>
<p n="960" start-line="24.203" end-line="24.218">Thus did they converse in the house of Hādēs
deep down within the bowels of the earth. [205]
Meanwhile Odysseus and the others passed out of
the town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled
farm of Laertes, which he had reclaimed with
infinite labor. Here was his house, with a lean-to
running all round it, where the slaves who worked
for him [210] slept and sat and ate, while inside
the house there was an old Sicilian woman, who
looked after him in this his country-farm. When
Odysseus got there, he said to his son and to the
other two: “Go to the house, [215] and kill the
best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile I
want to see whether my father will know me, or
fail to recognize me after so long an
absence.”</p>
<p n="961" start-line="24.219" end-line="24.243">He then took off his armor and gave it to
Eumaios and Philoitios, [220] who went straight on
to the house, while he turned off into the
vineyard to make trial of his father. As he went
down into the great orchard, he did not see
Dolios, nor any of his sons nor of the other
bondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to
make a fence [225] for the vineyard, at the place
where the old man had told them; he therefore
found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a
dirty old khiton, patched and very shabby; his
legs were bound round with thongs of ox-hide to
save him from the brambles, [230] and he also wore
sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his
head, and was looking full of grief [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]. When
much-enduring great Odysseus saw him so worn, so
old and full of sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>penthos</foreign>], he stood still under a tall
pear tree and began to weep. [235] He doubted
whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all
about his having come home, or whether he should
first question him and see what he would say. In
the end he thought it best [240] to be crafty with
him, so in this mind he went up to his father, who
was bending down and digging about a plant.</p>
<p n="962" start-line="24.244" end-line="24.279"><seg rend="subscript">244</seg> “Old sir,” said
noble Odysseus, “it is clear that you are most
knowledgeable in tending [245] an orchard
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">orkhatos</foreign>]. It
is well tended, with care [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">komidē</foreign>], and there is
nothing, <seg rend="subscript">246</seg> no plant
at all—no fig tree no grapevine no olive tree <seg
rend="subscript">247</seg> no pear tree no bed for
herbs—no, there is nothing in this whole garden
[<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kēpos</foreign>] that
lacks for care [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>komidē</foreign>]. I trust, however, that you
will not be offended if I say that you take better
care of your garden than of yourself. [250] You
are old, unsavory, and very meanly clad. It cannot
be because you are idle that your master takes
such poor care of you, indeed your face and figure
have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim
you of noble birth. I should have said that you
were one of those who should wash well, eat well,
[255] and lie soft at night as old men have a
right [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign>] to
do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose laborer
are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell
me also about another matter. Is this place that I
have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just now
[260] who said so, but he was a dull character,
and had not the patience to hear my story out when
I was asking him about an old friend of mine,
whether he was still living, or was already dead
and in the house of Hādēs. [265] Believe me when I
tell you that this man came to my house once when
I was in my own country and never yet did any
stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said
that his family came from Ithaca [270] and that
his father was Laertes, son of Arkeisios. I
received him hospitably, making him welcome to all
the abundance of my house, and when he went away I
gave him all customary presents. I gave him seven
talents of fine gold, [275] and a cup of solid
silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him
twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of
tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single
fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an
equal number of khitons. To all this I added four
good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and
I let him take his choice.”</p>
<p n="963" start-line="24.280" end-line="24.301">[280] His father shed tears and answered, “Sir,
you have indeed come to the country that you have
named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked
people. All this wealth of presents has been given
to no purpose. If you could have found your friend
here alive in the district [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Ithaca, [285]
he would have entertained you hospitably and would
have requited your presents amply when you left
him—as would have been only right considering what
you have already given him. But tell me, and tell
me true, how many years is it since you
entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as ever
was? Alas! [290] He has perished far from his own
country; <seg rend="subscript">291</seg> or
perhaps the fish devoured him in the sea [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], or he has
fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some
continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father,
who were his parents, could throw our arms about
him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his
excellent and richly dowered wife, circumspect
Penelope, [295] bewail her husband as was natural
upon his death bed, and close his eyes according
to the offices due to the departed. But now, tell
me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are
you—tell me of your town and parents? Where is the
ship lying that has brought you [300] and your men
to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other
man’s ship, and those who brought you here have
gone on their way and left you?”</p>
<p n="964" start-line="24.302" end-line="24.314">“I will tell you everything,” answered
resourceful Odysseus, “quite truly. I come from
Alybas, where I have a fine house. [305] I am son
of King Apheidas, who is the son of Polypemon. My
own name is Eperitos; a superhuman force [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] drove me off my
course as I was leaving Sikania, and I have been
carried here against my will. As for my ship it is
lying over yonder, off the open country outside
the town, and this is the fifth year [310] since
Odysseus left my country. Poor man, yet the omens
were good for him when he left me. The birds all
flew on our right hands, and both he and I
rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had
every hope that we should have another friendly
meeting and exchange presents.”</p>
<p n="965" start-line="24.315" end-line="24.326">[315] A dark cloud of sorrow [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] fell upon Laertes
as he listened. He filled both hands with the dust
from off the ground and poured it over his gray
head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of
Odysseus was touched, and his nostrils quivered as
he looked upon his father; [320] then he sprang
towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed
him, saying, “I am he, father, about whom you are
asking—I have returned after having been away for
twenty years. But cease your sighing and
lamentation—we have no time to lose, for I should
tell you [325] that I have been killing the
suitors in my house, to punish them for their
insolence and crimes.”</p>
<p n="966" start-line="24.327" end-line="24.329">“If you really are my son Odysseus,” replied
Laertes, “and have come back again, you must give
me such manifest proof [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>sēma</foreign>] of your identity as shall
convince me.”</p>
<p n="967" start-line="24.330" end-line="24.344">[330] “First observe this scar,” answered
resourceful Odysseus, “which I got from a boar’s
tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You
and my mother had sent me to Autolykos, my
mother’s father, to receive [335] the presents
which when he was over here he had promised to
give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the
trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I
asked you all about them as I followed you round
the garden. We went over them all, and you told me
their names and what they all [340] were. You gave
me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty
fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty
rows of vines; there was wheat planted between
each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when
the seasons [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>hōrai</foreign>] of Zeus have been laid heavy
upon them.”</p>
<p n="968" start-line="24.345" end-line="24.355">[345] Laertes’ strength failed him when he
heard the convincing signs [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">sēmata</foreign>] which his son
had given him. He threw his arms about him, and
Odysseus had to support him, or he would have gone
off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to, and
was beginning to recover [350] his senses, he
said, “O Father Zeus, then you gods are still in
Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been
punished for their insolence [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>] and folly.
Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have
all the townspeople of Ithaca up here directly,
and they will be sending [355] messengers
everywhere throughout the cities of the
Kephallēnians.”</p>
<p n="969" start-line="24.356" end-line="24.360">Resourceful Odysseus answered, “Take heart and
do not trouble yourself about that, but let us go
into the house hard by your garden. I have already
told Telemachus, Philoitios, [360] and Eumaios to
go on there and get dinner ready as soon as
possible.”</p>
<p n="970" start-line="24.361" end-line="24.374">Thus conversing the two made their way towards
the house. When they got there they found
Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd
cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. [365]
Then the old Sicilian woman took Laertes inside
and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put
him on a good cloak, and Athena came up to him and
gave him a more imposing presence, making him
taller and stouter than before. [370] And he
emerged from the bathtub [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>asaminthos</foreign>]. His dear son marveled at
him, <seg rend="subscript">371</seg> when he saw
him, face to face, looking like [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">enalinkios</foreign>] the immortal
gods, and said to him, “My dear father, some one
of the gods has been making you much taller and
better-looking.”</p>
<p n="971" start-line="24.375" end-line="24.382">[375] The spirited Laertes answered, “Would, by
Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that I were the
man I was when I ruled among the Kephallēnians,
and took Nerikon, that strong fortress on the
foreland. If I were still what I then was and had
been in our house yesterday with my armor on,
[380] I should have been able to stand by you and
help you against the suitors. I should have killed
a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced
to see it.”</p>
<p n="972" start-line="24.383" end-line="24.396">Thus did they converse; but the others, when
they had finished their work and the feast was
ready, left off working [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>ponos</foreign>], [385] and took each his proper
place on the benches and seats. Then they began
eating; by and by old Dolios and his sons left
their work and came up, for their mother, the
Sicilian woman who [390] looked after Laertes now
that he was growing old, had been to fetch them.
When they saw Odysseus and were certain it was he,
they stood there lost in astonishment; but
Odysseus scolded them good-naturedly and said,
“Sit down to your dinner, old man, and never mind
about your surprise; [395] we have been wanting to
begin for some time and have been waiting for
you.”</p>
<p n="973" start-line="24.397" end-line="24.405">Then Dolios put out both his hands and went up
to Odysseus. “Sir,” said he, seizing his master’s
hand and kissing it at the wrist, [400] “we have
long been wishing you home: and now the gods have
restored you to us after we had given up hoping.
All hail, therefore, and may the gods make you
prosperous [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>olbios</foreign>]. But tell me, does circumspect
Penelope already know [405] of your return, or
shall we send some one to tell her?”</p>
<p n="974" start-line="24.406" end-line="24.411">“Old man,” answered great Odysseus, “she knows
already, so you need not trouble about that.” Then
he took his seat, and the sons of Dolios gathered
round Odysseus [410] to give him greeting and
embrace him one after the other; then they took
their seats in due order near Dolios, their
father.</p>
<p n="975" start-line="24.412" end-line="24.437">While they were thus busy getting their dinner
ready, Rumor went round the town, and noised
abroad the terrifying fate that had befallen the
suitors; [415] as soon, therefore, as the people
heard of it they gathered from every quarter,
groaning and hooting before the house of Odysseus.
They took the dead away, buried every man his own,
and put the bodies of those who came from
elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the
fishermen to take each of them to his own place.
[420] They then met angrily in the place of
assembly, and when they were got together
Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with
grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]
for the death of his son, Antinoos, who had been
the first man killed by Odysseus, [425] so he
said, weeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has
done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of our
best men away with him in his fleet, and he has
lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his
return he has been killing all the foremost men
among the Kephallēnians. [430] Let us be up and
doing before he can get away to Pylos or to
shining Elis where the Epeioi rule, or we shall be
ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will
be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not
avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. [435]
For my own part I should have no more pleasure in
life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up,
then, and after them, before they can cross over
to the mainland.”</p>
<p n="976" start-line="24.438" end-line="24.449">He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him.
But Medon and the bard Phemios had now woken up,
[440] and came to them from the house of Odysseus.
Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they
stood in the middle of the assembly, and Medon
said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Odysseus did not do
these things against the will [445] of the gods. I
myself saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor
and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in
front of him encouraging him, and now going
furiously about the court and attacking the
suitors whereon they fell thick on one
another.”</p>
<p n="977" start-line="24.450" end-line="24.452">[450] Then pale fear laid hold of them, and old
Halitherses, son of Mastor the old warrior, rose
to speak, for he was the only man among them who
knew both past and future; so he spoke to them
plainly and in all honesty, saying,</p>
<p n="978" start-line="24.453" end-line="24.462">“Men of Ithaca, [455] it is all your own fault
that things have turned out as they have; you
would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor,
shepherd of the people, when we bade you check the
folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in
the wantonness of their hearts—wasting the
substance and dishonoring the wife [460] of a
chieftain who they thought would not return. Now,
however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell you.
Do not go out against Odysseus, or you may find
that you have been drawing down evil on your own
heads.”</p>
<p n="979" start-line="24.463" end-line="24.471">This was what he said, and more than half
raised a loud shout, and at once left the
assembly. But the rest stayed where they were,
[465] for the speech of Halitherses displeased
them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they
therefore hurried off for their armor, and when
they had armed themselves, they met together in
front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in
their folly. He thought [470] he was going to
avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he
was never to return, but was himself to perish in
his attempt.</p>
<p n="980" start-line="24.472" end-line="24.476">Then Athena said to Zeus, son of Kronos,
“Father, son of Kronos, king of kings, answer me
this question—What does your mind [<foreign
xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] bid you? [475]
Will you set them fighting still further, or will
you make peace between them?”</p>
<p n="981" start-line="24.477" end-line="24.486">And Zeus gatherer of clouds answered, “My
child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your
own plan [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]
[480] that noble Odysseus came home and took his
revenge upon the suitors? Do whatever you like,
but I will tell you what I think will be the most
reasonable arrangement. Now that Odysseus is
revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in
virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while
we cause the others to forgive and forget the
massacre of their sons and brothers. [485] Let
them then all become friends as heretofore, and
let peace and plenty reign.”</p>
<p n="982" start-line="24.487" end-line="24.488">This was what Athena was already eager to bring
about, so down she darted from off the topmost
summits of Olympus.</p>
<p n="983" start-line="24.489" end-line="24.495">Now when Laertes and the others had done
dinner, [490] much-enduring great Odysseus began
by saying, “Some of you go out and see if they are
not getting close up to us.” So one of Dolios’
sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold
he could see them all quite near, and said to
Odysseus, [495] “Here they are, let us put on our
armor at once.”</p>
<p n="984" start-line="24.496" end-line="24.501">They put on their armor as fast as they
could—that is to say Odysseus, his three men, and
the six sons of Dolios. Laertes also and Dolios
did the same—warriors by necessity in spite of
their gray hair. [500] When they had all put on
their armor, they opened the gate and sallied
forth, Odysseus leading the way.</p>
<p n="985" start-line="24.502" end-line="24.509">Then Zeus’ daughter, Athena, came up to them,
having assumed the form and voice of Mentor.
Much-enduring great Odysseus was glad when he saw
her, [505] and said to his beloved son Telemachus,
“Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an
engagement, which will show every man’s mettle, be
sure not to disgrace your ancestors, who were
eminent for their strength and courage all the
world over.”</p>
<p n="986" start-line="24.510" end-line="24.512">[510] “You say truly, my dear father,” answered
the spirited Telemachus, “and you shall see, if
you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your
family.”</p>
<p n="987" start-line="24.513" end-line="24.515">Laertes was delighted when he heard this.
“Skies above!” he exclaimed, “what a day I am
enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. [515] My son
and grandson are vying with one another in the
matter of valor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
>aretē</foreign>].”</p>
<p n="988" start-line="24.516" end-line="24.519">Then owl-vision Athena came close up to him and
said, “Son of Arkeisios—best friend I have in the
world—pray to the owl-vision damsel, and to Zeus
her father; then poise your spear and hurl
it.”</p>
<p n="989" start-line="24.520" end-line="24.532">[520] As she spoke she infused fresh vigor into
him, and when he had prayed to her he poised his
spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and
the spear went right through it, for the helmet
stayed it not, [525] and his armor rang rattling
round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
Meantime Odysseus and his son fell the front line
of the foe and smote them with their swords and
spears; indeed, they would have killed every one
of them, and prevented them from ever getting home
again, only Athena [530] raised her voice aloud,
and made every one pause. “Men of Ithaca,” she
cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the
matter at once without further bloodshed.”</p>
<p n="990" start-line="24.533" end-line="24.544">Then pale fear seized every one; they were so
frightened that their arms dropped from their
hands [535] and fell upon the ground at the sound
of the goddess’ voice, and they fled back to the
city for their lives. But much-enduring Odysseus
gave a great cry, and gathering himself together
swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of
Kronos sent a thunderbolt of fire [540] that fell
just in front of owl-vision Athena, so she said to
Odysseus, “Odysseus, noble son of Laertes and seed
of Zeus, stop this strife, or Zeus will be angry
with you.”</p>
<p n="991" start-line="24.545" end-line="24.548">[545] Thus spoke Athena, and Odysseus obeyed
her gladly. Then Athena, daughter of Zeus of the
aegis, assumed the form and voice of Mentor, and
presently made a covenant of peace between the two
contending parties.</p>
