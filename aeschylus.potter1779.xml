          <hi rend="initial">T</hi>HE noble author, with whoſe re­maining tragedies the public is here preſented, was an Athenian of an honourable family, diſtinguiſhed for the ſublimity of his genius and the ardor of his martial ſpirit. In his youth he had read Homer with the warmeſt enthuſiaſm; and finding his great maſter unrivalled in the poſſeſſion of the Epic, he early conceived the deſign of creating a new province for himſelf,

          and forming the Drama; ſo much we may be allowed to infer from the fable, that whilſt he was yet a boy Bacchus appeared to him as he lay aſleep in a vineyard, and commanded him to write tragedies. This noble deſign he ſoon executed, and before the twenty-fifth year of his age began to entertain his countrymen with repreſentations worthy of an Athenian audience. He had purſued theſe ſtudies about ten years, when Darius invaded Greece. His generals, Datis and Artaphernes, with an army of two hundred thouſand foot and ten thouſand horſe were now advanced to the plains of Marathon, diſtant only ten miles from Athens. The danger, which threatened his country, called forth the martial ſpirit of our poet; and very honourable mention is made of him, and his two brothers, Cynægirus and Amynias,

          Amynias, for their eminent valour in that battle: to have wanted courage on ſuch an occaſion would have been a mark of the moſt abject baſeneſs; but to be diſtinguiſhed in an action, where every ſoldier was an hero, is a proof of ſuperior merit: in a picture repreſenting the battle of Marathon the pourtrait of Æschylus was drawn: this was all the honour that Miltiades himſelf received from the ſtate for his glorious conduct on that day; he was placed at the head of the ten commanders, and drawn in the act of encouraging the ſoldiers and beginning the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some time after, Cynægirus was one of the four naval commanders, who, with an armament of one thouſand Grecians, defeated thirty thouſand Perſians; but he loſt his life in the action.

          Ten years after the battle of Marathon, when Xerxes made that immenſe preparation to revenge the defeat of his father, we find the two ſurviving brothers exerting their courage in the ſea-fight off Salamis: here Amynias, too boldly laying hold of a Perſian ſhip, had his hand lopped off with a ſabre; but Æſchylus defended him, and ſaved his life; and the Athenians decreed him the firſt honours, becauſe he was the firſt to attack the commander of the Perſian fleet, ſhattered the ſhip to pieces, and killed the Satrap. It is obſerved that the two brothers were ever after inſeparable. The following year Æschylus acquired freſh glory in the battle of Platæa, where the brave Perſian Mardonius was defeated and ſlain.

          <fw type="header">PREFACE.</fw>
          Having taken this active part in three the moſt memorable battles that grace the annals of Greece, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a good citizen and a brave man, he returned with ardor to his former ſtudies, and completed his deſign of making the Drama a regular, noble, and rational entertainment. He wrote about ſeventy tragedies, and was in great eſteem with his countrymen: but upon ſome diſguſt in the latter part of his life he retired from Athens to the court of Hiero king of Sicily, where about three years after he died in the ſixty-ninth year of his age.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cauſe of this diſguſt is variouſly related: ſome impute it to his impatience of the riſing fame of Sophocles, yet a young man, to whom the prize was adjudged againſt him; others to the preference given to the Elegies of Simonides written in ho­nour

          of thoſe, who fell in the field of Marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to have excelled in Elegy could have added no glory to the ſuperior genius of Æschylus: neither does it appear probable that ſuch a conteſt ſhould have happened thirty years after the battle was fought. From the other charge one would wiſh to vindicate ſo great a name; and happily it carries its own confutation with it; for whether Sophocles was only ſeven or ſeventeen years younger than Æschylus, which is not preciſely determined, he could not be a young man when the other was ſixty-four; and we know that the prize was adjudged to the laſt exhibition of Æschylus, which conſiſted of his Agamemnon, the Choephora, the Furies, and a ſatyric piece. But the tragedy of the

          Furies gave great offence to the city; and the poet, whether for that or on ſome other pretence, was accuſed of impiety. His brother Amynias pleaded his cauſe: the Athenians were ſtruck with this inſtance of fraternal affection, they reverenced their maimed veteran, and Æschylus was acquitted. But ſuch a ſpirit was not formed to ſubmit to the affront; it made too deep an impreſſion to be effaced; and the poet quitted the city with great indignation, declaring with a noble pride that he would entruſt his tragedies to poſterity, certain that he ſhould receive from thence the honour he deſerved. This honour the Athenians ſoon paid to his noble works: by a decree of the ſenate, never granted to any other, they offered rewards to any man that ſhould again exhibit his plays; they frequently adjudged

          the prize to him after his deceaſe, and acknowledged him the Father of Tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          To comprehend the juſtneſs of this honorable appellation, and to form a preciſe idea of the originality of Æschy-lus, it will be neceſſary to trace the Tragic Muſe from her birth to her yet infirm ſtate when this poet gave her ſtrength, ſpirit, and dignity. The ſtory has been told, it ſeems, twenty times already; let it not give offence if it be told once more: it ſhall be a ſhort tale.

          Tragedy then was at firſt no more than a ruſtic ſong in honour of Bacchus, attending the ſacrifice of a goat, an animal hated by the God becauſe its bite is particularly hurtful to the vine.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was originally no more than an accidental frolic became an annual cuſtom, next a public ſacrifice, and thence an

          eſtabliſhed rite; for as every thing in Pagan antiquity was ſacred, ſports and amuſements were changed into feaſts, and the temples were converted into theatres: but this by due degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Grecians, advancing in poliſhed manners, carried into their towns a feaſt that ſprung from the leiſure of the country: their beſt poets took a pride in compoſing theſe religious hymns to the honour of Bacchus, and embelliſhed them with the agreeable entertainments of muſic and dancing.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a length of time, the ſongs advancing in perfection, it was found neceſſary to give the ſinger ſome relief; and that the company might be amuſed during the pauſes of the music, an actor was introduced: his part could be no other than a ſingle ſpeech, ſetting forth that he repreſented Hercules, or Theſeus, or
          <pb n="x" facs="#p-x"/>

          ſome other hero of antiquity, and had performed ſuch or ſuch an illuſtrious achievement: at the next pauſe another perſonated character advanced; at the next, another; but each unrelated and unconnected with the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          This we imagine to be the ſtate of things, till Theſpis and Phrynicus had the addreſs to continue the ſame interlocutor through every pauſe of the muſic, and to make him the narrator of one uniform and continued ſtory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The novelty had the good fortune to pleaſe; and as the ſtories were intereſting, the ſongs in honour of Bacchus ceaſed to amuſe, till by degrees they loſt their original deſign, and took their colouring from the intermediate repreſentation. Such was the rude ſtate of Tragedy, when Æschylus conceived the great deſign of forming it into a new ſpecies
          <pb n="xi" facs="#p-xi"/>
          <fw type="header">PREFACE.</fw>
          <fw type="header">xi</fw>
          ſpecies of poetry that ſhould rival even the Epic in dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The humble arbor interwove with vine branches gave place to ſcenes of aſtoniſhing grandeur; the actor, no longer mounted on the cart of Theſpis with his face ſmeared over with lees of wine, or covered with a maſk formed from the bark of a tree, now trod a ſpacious ſtage, magnificently habited in a robe of honour and the ſtately buſkin; even the maſk, that eternal diſgrace of the Athenian theatre, wore a new and elegant form expreſſive of the character repreſented.
        </p>
        <p>
          But theſe exterior decorations were proofs only of the taſte of Æschylus: his ſuperior genius appeared in giving life to the piece, by introducing the dialogue, without which there could be no action; and from this circumſtance it is that he is with the higheſt propriety called

          called the Father of the Drama. It is commonly ſaid that Æschylus never produced more than two ſpeakers upon the ſtage at the ſame time; there are proofs to the contrary, though he generally adhered to that ſimple plan: but the new part, which the Chorus now took, amply ſupplied what we ſhould call that poverty of the ſtage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Muſic and the Dance could not, without infinite offence, be withdrawn from the gay and lively Athenians: Æschylus therefore retained the Ode and Muſic, which properly ſpeaking conſtituted the original Tragedy; but he adapted it to his plan, and intereſted it in the action; thereby giving an unity of deſign to the whole, an agreeableneſs and ſplendor to the ſpectacle, and adding the force and ſpirit of Lyric Poetry to

          the gravity and magnificence of the Tragic ſtile: but ſuch was the ſimplicity of ancient manners, ſupported by truth and decency, that the Chorus yet retained the moral and ſacred air of the firſt inſtitution; hence we find it always grave, ſententious, ſublime, and ardent in the cauſe of liberty, virtue, and religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Æschylus had ſtudied Homer with attention and judgment; from him he might learn propriety and dignity of character, ſublimity of conception, and magnificence of expreſſion: and it was impoſſible for him not to obſerve the neceſſity of building his plan upon one great and intereſting action; but in this nature and good ſenſe preſcribed a different conduct to the Tragic and the Epic poet. In the cloſet the mind may be agreeably entertained by the Epic muſe,

          whilſt ſhe leads us backwards and forwards through the various fortunes of her hero, and ſometimes makes excurſions in purſuit of incidental adventures; whilſt the imagination loves to attend her in her flights, and diſdains to be confined by the narrow limits of time and place. But where the poetic imitation is made by action, and repreſented at once to the eye, a ſeverer diſcipline becomes neceſſary; that faithful monitor checks the rovings of fancy, exacts a ſober regard to unity of time and place, and demands a ſimpler plan: the good ſenſe of Æschylus led him to obſerve this; and in alluſion to it he often uſed to ſay, with much modeſty, that his tragedies were only ſingle diſhes taken from the great feaſt of Homer.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the Tragic Muſe loſt any thing in the regions of imagination, ſhe found herſelf
          <pb n="xv" facs="#p-xv"/>
          <fw type="header">PREFACE.</fw>
          <fw type="header">xv</fw>
          herſelf amply recompenſed by the empire ſhe acquired over the paſſions; the imitation of nature is her province, as well as the Epic Muſe's; and this imitation is ſtronger and more perfect in action than in narration. Æschylus, by introducing the Dialogue and engaging the Chorus in the intereſt of the Drama, gave birth to Action properly ſo called, and placed the Actors in ſuch a lively manner before the eyes of the ſpectators, that they ſuffered themſelves to be agreeably deceived, they forgot that the high-wrought ſcene was fictitious, and entered into the intereſts and paſſions of the perſons repreſented with real emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This alſo required a different conduct in the Tragic and the Epic Poet: the province of the latter is to inſtruct and delight; and he marches on to his end with a majeſtic pace through
          <pb n="xvi" facs="#p-xvi"/>
          <fw type="header">xvi</fw>
          <fw type="header">PREFACE.</fw>
          the extenſive regions of moral, paſſion, and deſcription: Æschylus perceived that the Drama is confined to one point of place, and one point of time; that therefore its buſineſs is to advance with rapidity, and ſieze the heart at once: the paſſions then are its peculiar province. It is finely conceived by P. Brumoy that Æschylus repreſented the Epos to his mind as a majeſtic queen ſeated on her throne, her brow ſhaded with clouds, but ſo as to diſcover great deſigns and wonderful revolutions: whilſt his ſtrong imagination figured tragedy as bathed in tears, her poignard in her hand, attended by terror and pity, preceded by deſpair, and followed by woe.
        </p>
        <p>
          This great maſter was well acquainted with the human heart; he found it more
          <pb n="xvii" facs="#p-xvii"/>

          more averſe to miſery than deſirous of happineſs, and tremblingly alive to the ſhocks of fear, that gives us continual notice of the evils inſeparable from human life. Cloſely allied to this paſſion is another, that makes the heart recoil at the ſight of thoſe miſeries which befall another, and to which we are ourſelves equally liable. Terror and pity then are the ſtrongeſt, the moſt common, and therefore the moſt dangerous of all the paſſions; they overwhelm the human heart, render it incapable of bearing up againſt the repeated impreſſions of ills, and of diſcharging with a proper degree of firmneſs the neceſſary duties of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          To purge theſe paſſions, to take away their pernicious qualities, and preſerve whatever they have of uſeful, is the buſineſs in common of the philoſopher and the poet;

          <fw type="header">PREFACE.</fw>
          but theſe effect their ends by different means; the former applies himſelf to the underſtanding by the cool deductions of reaſon; the poet plays the paſſions againſt themſelves, expels terror by terror, and pity by pity, and makes the weapon, that gave the wound, perform the cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evils, of which we are either ſpectators or ſufferers in the larger theatre of human life, ſtrike the heart with a terror that cruſhes all its powers, or with a pity that diſſolves them: but in the mimic ſcene the poet by captivating the imagination has the addreſs to convey certain ſenſations of pleaſure, of which we cannot diveſt ourſelves, and thereby intereſts our attention to the fictitious ſcenes, ſpreading over the ſoul that moſt exquiſite of all its feelings, a calm dignity of grief that at once chaſtiſes and refines it, and thereby

          thereby teaching the heart to ſupport its own afflictions with a manly fortitude, or to feel for the afflictions of others with a ſenſibility corrected by reaſon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theſe are ſo evidently the effects of the ancient Drama, that they are from thence deduced as rules for its conſtruction; and to refuſe the great poet the honour of having this deſign in the plan of his tragedies, would be as violent an injuſtice as to deny that the great painter <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1">

          Thus tragedy owes its exiſtence to the creative hand of Æschylus: like his own Prometheus, he not only gave it being and form, but animated it with the brighteſt ray of ætherial fire; leaving poſterity to admire the force of his genius, and to doubt whether he was ever excelled, or even equalled, till our Shakespear aroſe bleſſed with an happier invention and more extenſive powers.

        <p>
          It is pleaſant however to obſerve in what manner ſome writers, who would take it ill to be denied the firſt rank in criticiſm, ſpeak of this author. Sublimity of conception, magnificence of ſtyle, and the high tragic ſpirit they graciouſly allow him; in this they ſafely build upon the judgment of Longinus, Horace, and Quintilian, from whence there is no appeal: the ſame judgment had alſo pronounced him

          him ſometimes harſh and incorrect; and ſo, without adverting to the meaning of theſe great critics, that Longinus is ſpeaking of the boldneſs of his imagery, and Quintilian, as if commenting on Horace, of his ſtyle, which had not yet acquired its juſt accuracy and correſtneſs, they carry the cenſure into the compoſition of his tragedies, which they repreſent as wild, irregular, and frequently fantaſtic; his plots, as rude and inartificial; his ſcenes, as unconnected and ill-placed; his characters, as ſtrongly marked, but all partaking of that wild fierceneſs which is the characteriſtic of the author.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, and amongſt theſe are the beſt French critics, repreſent him as difficult, obſcure, and in ſome places ſcarcely to be underſtood: Another tells us that his thoughts riſe in a natural ſucceſſion; that

          that inſtead of being perplexed, one runs along with him, nay often before him: We are indeed gravely recommended to take his ſoul and genius, in ſome degree, along with us; that does not fall to the ſhare of every reader, nor of every critic; but to an Acumen, that finds no obſcurity in Lycophron, no wonder that Æschylus is even familiar.

        <p>
          The amiable candor of a fine writer, who has joined an accurate taſte to the deepeſt penetration, and the fineſt ſenſibility to the moſt chaſtiſed judgment, teaches us thus to apologize for heaven-born genius, that acts from ſomething ſuperior and antecedent to rules:

          But even this generous apology is ſeldom wanted for Æschylus, except in his tragedy of Prometheus: there indeed the poet has given free ſcope to his unbounded imagination, and exerted the ſtrength and ardor of his genius with a wild and terrible magnificence; the

          limits of this world were not ſufficient for his extenſive and daring ſpirit, but it made excurſions beyond the walks of mortal man: each perſonated character is a Divinity, and the illuſtrious ſufferer an ancient God of the high and haughty race of Titan, unworthily puniſhed for his benevolence, and præ-ſcient that no ſubmiſſion could mitigate the ſeverity of his fate; here that horrid grandeur of the ſcene has a peculiar propriety; and the reader of taſte does not wiſh to ſee Prometheus abate any thing of that unconquerable ſpirit, with which he defies the Thunderer.

          In Æschylus the ſublime is truely expreſſive of the elevation of his mind: born with a ſoul of fire, and animated with whatever is great and noble, all his ideas are magnificent and full of energy; what he conceived boldly he expreſſed with

          with a correſpondent dignity of ſtyle; as his judgment informed him that manners in Tragedy would admit a ſtronger colouring than in the Epos, becauſe there every thing ſpeaks to the eye and the heart, ſo he gave it at once an higher tone and greater pomp of diction; this perhaps he has carried to an exceſs; his epithets are ſometimes harſh and turgid, and by endeavouring always to ſupport an elevation of ſtyle he has rendered it what P. Brumoy well expreſſes by <hi rend="foreign">"quelquefois gigan­teſque."</hi> But this is to be underſtood only of his diction: his images, with all their magnificence, never overſtep the modeſty of nature; they are indeed conceived with that inimitable fire, and expreſſed with ſuch a daring ſublimity, that it requires no ſmall portion of the high poetic ſpirit to attend him through his

          his boundleſs flights; and this is one principal reaſon of that obſcurity which is complained of in his choral Odes: but to aſſert from hence that his figures often obſcure his ſenſe rather than enlighten it, is to ſpeak the language of taſteleſs criticiſm, that meditates its frigid lucubrations over the midnight lamp, leaving true genius, like the eagle, to ſoar undazzled by the blazing ſun when he <q>“glows with unmitigated day."</q>

          We have lately been told that if we conſider the ſtate of the Drama, when Æschylus undertook to reform and improve it, we ſhall behold him with admiration; if we compare him with his two illuſtrious ſucceſſors, he hides his diminiſhed head, and appears far leſs conſpicuous.

          unknown to ancient Greece: the ſtate of Athens paid honours to Æschylus, which never were granted to any other poet: Ariſtophanes, who certainly was not deficient in taſte, gave the preference to Æschylus; and Lycurgus, to whom the poetic world is ſo greatly indebted, erected ſtatues alike to Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and ordered their tragedies to be tranſcribed and preſerved together. In pronouncing on their comparative merit, the beſt critics aſſign to Æschylus the high tragic dignity, to Sophocles harmonious elegance, to Euripides the moral and pathetic.

        <p>
          As the temper of the times muſt always have a great influence on the genius of their poets, we may in ſome meaſure account for this difference of character from the different ſtate of Athens in the periods when theſe three great

        <p>
          Whilſt Æschylus was in the vigor of his age, the generous glow of liberty and the high martial ſpirit blazed out with the brighteſt ardor; it was ſucceſsful; and Athens was the proud ſcene of conqueſts, glories, triumphs, ſpoils: Æschylus had borne an active and honorable part in theſe great engagements; his genius was naturally ſublime and daring; the ſpirit of the times called forth the ſpirit of the poet, was highly flattered by it, and in return received it with the greateſt pleaſure and warmeſt applauſe.

          <q type="prose">"If perfect and faultleſs compoſition is ever to be expected from human faculties, it muſt be at ſome happy period, when a noble and graceful ſimplicity, the reſult of well-regulated and ſober magnanimity, reigns through the general manners.

        </p>
        <p>
          The Athenians had now an opportunity in the calm of peace to enjoy the riches which they had acquired in the Perſian war; nor were they of a diſpoſition to neglect the enjoyment: this of courſe brought on a greater refinement of taſte, and a ſofter delicacy of ſentiment; but the ancient ſimplicity of manners was not yet corrupted; it only became more elegant, and formed the pathetic Euripides, the greateſt maſter of the tender paſſions: and happily for the cauſe of virtue the chaſte and philoſophic friend of Socrates might well be truſted with his empire over them.

If then the glorious ſcenes of war and conqueſt were peculiarly favorable to the bold and firey genius of Æschylus, <q>"the period, when Sophocles and Euripides wrote, was that in which the fine arts and polite literature were in a degree of perfection, which ſucceeding ages have emulated in vain,"</q> till an amiable writer of our own, by an happy effort of <q>"heaven-born genius"</q> regulated by the moſt chaſtiſed judgment, united the powers of the three illuſtrious Grecians, and has charmed us with the tenderneſs of Euripides in Elfrida, with the force of Æschylus, and the correctneſs and harmony of Sophocles in Caractacus, adding from his own ſtores a richneſs and a grace with which the ſeverity of the Athenian Drama was unacquainted.

          Notwithstanding the acknowledged merit of this truely original writer, he ſeems to have been little ſtudied even by the learned of theſe later ages: of all our other poets Milton and Mr. Gray are the only two that have imitated his manner, and caught the fire of his genius; unleſs we may add to them our ſublime Collins.

          A minute examination of the particular images, which theſe noble writers may ſeem to have glanced at in Æschylus, would be equally uncandid and invidious; it is more agreeable and more juſt to obſerve, that from whatever ſparks they kindled <q>"the Muſes Veſtal Fires,"</q> they had genius of their own to <q>"fan them to that dazzling blaze of ſong,"</q> which muſt always make them the glory of Engliſh Poetry.

            Thoſe who are beſt acquainted with Æschylus in the original language, will be moſt ſenſible of the difficulties of preſenting him properly to the Engliſh reader ; the Tranſlator ſaw and felt them enough. In a language, that has ſo long ceaſed to be ſpoken, many peculiar elegances muſt eſcape even thoſe that read it with the greateſt accuracy ; and many of thoſe, which are obſerved, will neceſſarily loſe the richneſs of their colouring, when copied into another language: and this muſt always be the caſe where the whole beauty depends upon the choice and arrangement of words and ſyllables conſtituting an inimitable harmony of expreſſion. <q xml:lang="fre">"Un tour en toute langue (ſays the excellent Brumoy) vaut ſouvent une penſée, et en eſt véritablement une.

Yet the Tranſlator was not diſcouraged: he had an ambition to preſent this noble author to the Engliſh reader, and flattered himſelf that his attempt would be acceptable to

In conſequence of this, I have now the honour of preſenting to you ſuch remarks, as occurred to me upon a careful review of my author ; theſe may poſſibly be of ſervice to the leſs informed reader, and for ſuch notes in general, and even tranſlations, are principally intended: thus far all may be well; but your expectations muſt be diſappointed; for ſuch writing is not in its nature amuſing, and you want no infor­mation

            I know your active mind wiſhes to penetrate through the allegorical covering, which the philoſophers, poets, and prieſts of ancient times threw over their phyſical, moral, and theological inquiries ; but the boaſt of Iſis yet remains, and no mortal hath removed her veil. The misfortune is, almoſt all the monuments of Egyptian learning are loſt, and of the Egyptian Gods nothing remains but fable : the light, which we receive upon theſe ſubjects, is chiefly derived from the Greek writers, and this by no means pure; they were indeed enough acquainted with Egypt to acquire from thence a turn for mythologizing, but we may obſerve, that it did not always fit eaſy upon

            upon them ; ill inſtructed in the antiquities of their own country, they have tranſmitted to us a confuſed heap of uncertain traditions ; and theſe, by falling into the hands of the poets, are become ſtill more extravagant ; the conſequence of which is, they have multiplied doubts, to which one would willingly prefer the moſt profound ignorance.

            You would be the more convinced of the juſtneſs and good ſenſe of this obſervation of the learned and excellent M. le Count Caylus, could you bear to read the celebrated treatiſe of Plutarch concerning Iſis and Oſiris, where you would find ſuch a mixture of hiſtory and fable, allegory and explication, reaſoning and abſurdity, as would deter you from further inquiry; yet Plutarch was one of the moſt learned and inquiſitive perſons of his age, and in

            Yet for our times theſe diſcoveries ſeem to have been reſerved; we have writers on mythology in abundance ; and though they differ in their explications, yet they agree in an unclaſſical diſregard to antiquity and truth, and in a barbarous attempt to demoliſh all the monuments of Egypt and Greece, and with their materials ſome to repair the temple of Jeruſalem, ſome to build up ſyſtems of their own ; theſe indeed are <hi rend="foreign">un peu bizarres</hi>, and what one of them ſays of the others, we may with equal reaſon apply to them all, <q xml:lang="fre">"On cherche quelque lumiere, et l'on ne voit qu' amas indigeſte d'une vaſte erudition et l'abus le plus etrange des Langues, que l'on honora fauſſement du nom de Science etymologique."</q>

          </p>
          <p>
            Religion is natural to the human mind , and when the early ages had ſunk to that miſerable blindneſs as to loſe ſight of the true God, who revealed himſelf to their firſt progenitor, they looked up to the Heavens, and ſtruck with admiration of the nature of the univerſe, ſuppoſed the Sun and Moon to be the eternal and firſt Gods. The voice of antiquity is uniform in this; the earlieſt account we have is from the Fragment of Sanchoniatho, which tells us, that Aon and Protogonus in times of
            <pb n="xlvi" facs="#p-xlvi"/>
            <fw type="header">[ xlvi ]</fw>
            of drought ſtretched their hands to the Heavens towards the Sun ; for this they eſteemed as God the ſole lord of the Heaven. As Diodorus Siculus tells us the ſame thing of the Egyptians, ſo Herodotus gives us a ſimilar account of the ancient Perſians and Libyans ; this Hyde calls the firſt interpolation: and Plato ſays, that the earlieſt Grecians worſhipped the Sun, and the Moon, and the Earth, and the Stars, and the Heaven, as many barbarians do now. Thus elementary worſhip was the firſt ſpecies of idolatry.

            which had made a prince the father of his people, induced them out of gratitude and reverence to deify him after his deceaſe, and to pay him divine honours : thus Sanchoniatho tells us, that when Hypſiſtus was killed by wild beaſts, he was deified, and his children made libations and ſacrifices to him. And in what other ſenſe can we underſtand Heſiod, when he ſpeaks of the ſacred race of the immortal Gods, which were born of the Earth ; and of the Earth as producing the Heaven, that it might be the ſeat of the immortal Gods?

            Tully in the firſt book of his *Tuſculan Diſputations*, arguing for the exiſtence of the ſoul after death, proves from the pontifical law, and the inviolable ceremonies of ſepulture, that death is not a privation of being, but a migration of life, which leads illuſtrious perſons to the ſkies ; he inſtances in Romulus, and ſays, that Rome derived this opinion from Greece ; that not only Hercules, Bacchus, Caſtor, and Pollux, Leucothea, and their own Matuta, but that even the Dii majorum gentium would be found, by tracing the antiquities of Greece, to have been advanced from mortals to be Gods.

            which were prior to alphabetic writing, and repreſented one thing by another : thus horns were the ſymbol of power ; hence Hermes placed on the head of Iſis an helmet formed with the horns of a Bull : and an heifer being in Egypt the well-known ſymbol of Fertility, this their tutelary Goddeſs is repreſented ſometimes as a moſt beautiful woman with the horns of an heifer, ſometimes with the head of an heifer, and ſometimes intirely as an heifer. Hence the Iö of the Grecians.
          </p>
          <p>
            But a practice, which naturally enough took its riſe from this mode of repreſentation, was afterwards encouraged by the prieſts with a different view: as mankind grew more inqui­ſitive

            and more enlightened, they had reaſon to fear, that the origin of their hero gods might be detected, which would of courſe greatly weaken the veneration in which they were held, and have a tendency to ſubvert the public religion ; but the ſymbolic worſhip, by adding myſtery to their theology, and keeping the truth out of ſight, would at leaſt ſupport, if not increaſe the veneration ; therefore the more impenetrable the obſcurity was made, the better would its end be anſwered.
          </p>
          <p>
            This end was likewiſe effected, and the people were more eaſily reconciled to hero-worſhip by another method, which led them to ſupport the new idolatry on the old, by giving the deified mortal the name of the planet, and inverſely by giving the planet the name of

            of the new god ; thus Oſiris was the Sun, and the Sun was Oſiris. So Sanchoniatho tells us, that Chronus, i. e. Saturn, after his deceaſe was hallowed into the planet of Saturn ; and Plutarch ſays, that the Egyptian prieſts affirm that the bodies of the Gods, ſuch as were not of immortal origin and incorruptible, were depoſited with them ; but that their ſouls ſhined ſtars in the Heaven; ſome therefore expreſsly ſay, that Oſiris was the Sun, by the Greeks called Sirius ; and that Iſis was the Moon,

            repreſented under both characters by the ſame image ; that her horns were reſemblances of the Moon , and that ſhe was habited in a black ſtole, to denote her occultations, in which ſhe wanders ſeeking the Sun. I have ſomewhere ſeen an image of this Goddeſs, on which the horns are perfectly lunar, and ſo formed, that the blank diſc of the moon is faintly ſhadowed within their circle.

            As the human mind advanced in knowledge, theſe ſymbolical repreſentations were too groſs to paſs upon the inquiſitive as proper objects of their religious adoration ; the prieſts therefore, who were now deeply intereſted in the craft, and the vanity of philofophizing, attempted to cover the abſurdity of theſe brute-figured deities, by pretending that they were mythological allegories, which veiled all the great truths of theology, ethics, and phyſics.
          </p>

            Sanchoniatho, who had told us, that Taaut, the Egyptian Hermes, imitating Ouranus, formed the figures of the Gods in ſacred characters (where we find this deity the patron rather of the ingenious Carlini and the goddeſs-making Reynolds, than of Poor Robin and Vincent Wing) , tells us alſo, that the ſon of Thabion, the earlieſt Phœnician Hierophant, allegorized all theſe things, and mixed them with phyſical and elementary ideas. In this ſtate they paſſed to the Grecians, whoſe volatile and inventive genius, added fable to mythology, and extravagance to allegory, till, as Mr. Bryant expreſſes it, <q>"we find the whole,

            The Engliſh reader is now well acquainted with the hiſtory and character of Prometheus : Æschylus indeed had the good ſenſe to omit the ſilly tale of the bull's hide and the bones ; and Plato in his Protagoras, has told his ſtory in the moſt agreeable manner: but where
            <pb n="lviii" facs="#p-lviii"/>
            <fw type="header">[ lviii]</fw>
            where in hiſtory ſacred or profane, where in religion or in nature ſhall we find this worthy? Shall we draw him out of Noah's Ark? Shall we yoke him to the plough in Egypt, thence ſend him to a mountain to eſcape the inundation of the Nile, which overſpread his province rapid as an Eagle's flight, in deſpair, till Hercules repaired the ravages, and taught the river to confine itſelf to its channel? Shall we find him on Mount Horeb in the perſon of Moſes? Or ſhall we take up with any one, or with all the fourteen interpretations of Alexander Roſs? The civilizing, oneiro-critic, and medicinal arts, which he boaſts to have taught mankind, ſhow him to have been an Egyptian, they fix him to the age of Oſiris, they even mark him to be Oſiris himſelf ; for he was the wiſe and benevolent civili­zer,

            he reclaimed his Egyptians from their poor and ſavage life, he inſtructed them in agriculture, gave them laws, and taught them to honour the Gods. But his name, as well as that of his inconſiderate brother, is purely Greek ; and probably he owes his civilizing qualities to the vanity of that people, who had a wonderful propenſity to claim to themſelves the invention of all the arts of poliſhed life.

            Had we nothing of his ſtory, but what is ſo elegantly related by Plato, we ſhould not heſitate to pronounce him an emblem of the Divine Providence in the formation of man ; and as ſuch we muſt accept it, little doubting but that his chains, and the eagle preying on his heart, were wild and extravagant fables ſuperadded to the original ſober allegory : no uncommon practice this. Mr. Bryant well accounts for this, when he ſays, <q>"The hiſtory of Prometheus was certainly taken from hieroglyphics miſunderſtood, and badly explained, at leaſt from the ſacred devices upon the entablatures of temples. Prometheus was worſhipped by the Colchians as a deity ; and had a temple and high place called Typhæonia Petra upon Mount Caucaſus ; the device upon the portal was Egyptian, an Eagle over an Heart ; the Eagle and the Vulture were the inſignia of that country ."</q> The Heart was another hieroglyphical character .-It were to be wiſhed, that this very ingenious and learned gentleman, had favoured us with his authority for this intereſting circumſtance; it would have been more

            ſatisfactory to his readers, though his fidelity cannot be ſuſpected : it were alſo to be wiſhed, that he had ſtopped here ; for beyond this we have no ſupport from antiquity ; neither reaſon nor religion can account for a ſtory ſo inconſiſtent with both ; and of conjectures we have enough : but the ſpirit of mythologizing is gone forth, and all fleſh is humbled in its ſight; gods and men, heaven and earth, the air and the ſea, theology, phyſics, and ethics, and all the monuments of antiquity fall before it;

            As Socrates one evening was walking with his friend Phædrus on the banks of the Ilyſſus, the young man aſked whether that was the place whence Boreas was ſaid to have carried off the virgin Orithyia : being ſhown the place a little lower down the ſtream, where an altar to Boreas yet ſtood, he ſays, <q>But tell me, I conjure you, Socrates, are you perſuaded that this mythological narration is true ?</q> <q>If I ſhould diſbelieve it, as wiſe men do, the philoſopher replies, I ſhould not be guilty of any great abſurdity ; then I ſhould ſhow my acute­neſs, and ſay that the violence of the north-wind drove her down thoſe rocks as ſhe was playing with Pharmacia, and that, periſhing there, ſhe was ſaid to have been carried away by Boreas.</q> <q>Thoſe things, my Phædrus, on ſome accounts, I think agreeable, but they are the inquiries

<head>PROMETHEUS CHAIN'D.</head>
<lg type="prose" n="introduction">
<p>ÆSCHYLUS wrote three Tragedies on the ſtory of Prometheus: the firſt exhibited him as carrying the ſacred gift of fire to men; the ſecond as chained to Caucasus; the third as delivered from his chains. Of theſe the ſecond only remains to us. The ſhort account, which Prometheus gives in this of the barbarous ſtate of man before he taught them the civilizing arts, makes us regret the loſs of the firſt; and we have good reaſon to imagine that the portrait of Hercules in the third, delineated by this great maſter, muſt 
<pb n="4"/>
muſt have been inimitable. There is in this remaining drama a ſublimity of conception, a ſtrength, a fire, a certain ſavage dignity peculiar to this bold writer. The ſcenery is the greateſt that the human imagination ever formed: the wild and deſolate rock frowning over the ſea, the ſtern and imperious ſons of Pallas and Styx holding up Prometheus to its rifted ſide whilſt Vulcan fixes his chains, the Nymphs of the Ocean flying to its ſummit to commiſerate his unhappy ſtate, old Oceanus on his hippogriff, the appearance of Iö, the deſcent of Mercury, the whirlwind tearing up the ſands, ſwelling the boiſterous ſea, and daſhing its waves to the ſtars, the vollied thunders rolling all their firey rage againſt the rock, and the figure of Prometheus unappalled at this terrible ſtorm, and bidding defiance to Jupiter, would require the utmoſt effort of Salvator Roſa's genius to repreſent them. Yet is the horrid greatneſs of this drama tempered with much tenderneſneſs; the reluctance of Vulcan to execute the ſevere commands of Jupiter is finely contraſted to the eager unfeeling inſolence of Strength and Force; the character of Iö is mournfully gentle; and the Oceanitidæ are of a moſt amiable mildneſs 
<pb n="5"/>

joined to a firm but modeſt prudence; even the untameable ferocity of Prometheus diſcovers under it a benevolence that intereſts us deeply in his ſufferings.</p>

a model even to the gentle and paſſionate Ovid; and that heart must have little of the fine feelings of humanity, that does not ſympathize with their diſtreſs. </p>

<p>The ſcene is near the ſhore, in an open grove cloſe to the altar and images of the Gods preſiding over the ſacred games, with a view of the ſea and the ſhips of Ægyptus on one ſide, and of the towers of Argos on the other;  with hills, and woods, and vales, a river flowing between them; all together with

<head>THE SEVEN CHIEFS AGAINST THEBES.</head>
<div type="textpart" n="introduction">
<p>BESIDES this Siege of Thebes Æschylus wrote three Tragedies on the subjects of Laius, Oedipus, and the Sphinx, which are lost. Woe to the ravenous jaws of time, that have devoured these precious morsels of antiquity; we should otherwise have had from this great master a regular, and, no doubt, an interesting account of this</p>
<pb n="168"/>
<p>this illustrious and unfortunate family. It is said that Aeschylus particularly valued himself upon this tragedy: not without reason; for it has all that bold painting, with which we might expect his martial genius would embellish such a subject. Always magnificent, he has fixed the scene in Thebes before the principal temple: the clash of arms, the neighing of the horses, and the shouts of the soldiers are heard:</p>
<p>Eteocles appears surrounded with the citizens, whom he animates to defend the walls: in the mean time the Chorus, which is composed of Theban Ladies, distracted with their fears are hanging on the statues of the Gods that adorn the area before the temple.</p>
<p>Longinus has remarked on the sublimity of the dialogue; it is worthy an experienced veteran and a brave young king arming in defence of his crown, his life, and his honour;</p>
<pb n="169"/>
<p>honour; it is worthy of Aeschylus. The characters of the Seven Chiefs, that command in the attack, are exquisitely marked and varied; and their impetuous ferocity is admirably contrasted with the calm and deliberate courage of those appointed to oppose them. The shields of six of these chief are charged with armorial <ref target="note.169.*">*</ref> bearings expressive of their characters, and as regular as if they had been marshaled by an herald at arms: the impresses are 
    
<pb n="170"/>
devised with a fine imagination and wonderful propriety.</p>
<p>The judicious choice of the persons of the Chorus forms one of the principal graces of this tragedy, as it gave the poet an opportunity of mixing the natural timidity of the female character with the animated and firey daring of heroes, the fears of these daughters of Cadmus presenting nothing to their imagination but the scenes of distress and horror, which the insolence of conquest spreads through a vanquished and plundered city, and this painted in the warmest colours, in the strongest style of Aeschylus.</p>
<p>Besides the intrinsic beauty of this tragedy, which is very striking, it has to us this further merit, that it gave birth to three the
<pb n="171"/>
the finest poems of antiquity, the Antigone of Sophocles, the Phenisse of Euripides, and the Thebaid of Statius.</p>

Euripides has a fine tragedy, the whole distress of which turns upon this idea; a translation of this will shortly be given to the public, and the reader may expect to find the subject more fully examined. - As the Chorus were by their office to be exact observers of the laws religious and civil, their task was here very nice and difficult. Not to assist in burying the dead, were impious: not to obey the mandates of their rulers, were an offence against the laws of their country: the poet with great judgment leaves this interesting point undetermined, in the only manner that remained not to give offence.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="notes">
<note xml:id="note.7.a"><p>According to the theogony of Hefiod, Chaos was the anceſtor of Nature; next to him was Gaia: her progeny by Ouranus was numerous, amongſt these were Oceanus and Japetus: by Clymene, daughter of Oceanus, Japetus was the father of Prometheus, with whoſe history the Athenians were well acquainted from the narrative of Hefiod, which was, we may ſuppoſe, the popular creed of the times in which our poet wrote. The Engliſh reader is by this time as well acquainted with this ſtrange ſtory.</p>
    <p>Theſe two allegorical perſonages were of high antiquity and illustrious birth, the fons of Pallas and Styx. Coeus, the ſon of Ouranus and Gaia, was the father of Pallas by Eurybia, daughter of Pontus and Gaia: Styx was the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. When Jupiter aſſembled the gods on Olympus, and declared his gracious intention to reward and honour each that ſhould be auxiliary to him in his wars against the Titans, Styx, by the advice of her father, was the firſt that attended him, leading with her theſe her two ſons; Jupiter received her with great reſpect, appointed her to be the ſacred oath of the gods, and admitted her fons to be conſtant attendants on his own perſon. Hefiod. Theog. v. 400.</p></note>
<note xml:id="note.9.b">Themis was one of the moſt antient and reſpectable deities, the daughter of Ouranus and Gaia, that is of Heaven and Earth. As she was the ſecond prophetic power that held her oracular feat at Delphos, ſhe was honoured as the goddess of Truth and Juſtice.</note>



<note xml:id="note.14.c">No writer knew better how to preſerve propriety of character than Æschylus. Prometheus diſdained to answer the ferocious inſolence of these miniſters of Jupiter, nor could even the tender commiferation of Vulcan elicit a word from him. There is a dignity, and even a ſublimity in this filence beyond the expreſſion of words. But as ſoon as the inſtruments of tyranny left him, he burſts into a ſtrain of pathetic lamentation, and invokes all nature to atteſt his undeſerved ſufferings. There is a further propriety in this addreſs; the Winds were the fons of Nereus and Doris, the Rivers of Oceanus and Tethys, the Sun of Hyperion and Thea, whoſe parents were Ouranus and Gaia: these were all kindred gods, benevolent to Prometheus, and deeply affected with his miſeries.</note>
<note xml:id="note.15.d"><cit><quote xml:lang="lat">Refertur ad levem sonum undarum ventis exagitatarum, qui etiam aliquantulum crispant maris dorfum quafi amabili quâdam γελασία.</quote>-<bibl>STANLEY</bibl></cit>. The image is here fo beautifully poetical, that the tranſlator could not give it up for the cool correction of Pauw.</note>

<note xml:id="note.16.e">This ſoftly-breathing odour marks the approach of ſome divinity. When Juno, in the 14th Iliad, retires to her apartment to dreſs with more than ordinary care, Here firſt ſhe bathes, and round her body pours, Soft oil of fragrance, and ambrofial ſhow'rs: The winds perfum'd the balmy gale convey Thro' heav'n, thro' earth, and all th' aerial way; Spirit divine! whoſe exhalation greets The ſenſe of gods with more than mortal ſweets. POPE. Thus Venus in the firſt Eneid diſcovers herſelf to Æneas, Ambrofiæque comæ divinum vertice odorem Spiravere. Her waving locks immortal odours ſhed, And breath'd ambrofial ſcents around her head. PITT.</note>
<note xml:id="note.17.f">Aeschylus with great judgment introduces these daugh ters of Oceanus as attending Prometheus; by their confanguinity they must be a friendly train. In the ſimplicity of antient manners their father's conſent must firſt be obtained; and even thus virgin modesty is ſomething hurt. The Nymphs of the waters wore no ſandals; hence Thetis is called the ſilverfooted, as Juno is the goldenflippered queen.</note>
<note xml:id="note.19.g">Japetus had three fons, Mencetius, Prometheus, and, Epimetheus. Mencetius, for his inſolence and audacious attempts, was by Jupiter ſmitten with thunder, and caſt into Tartarus, where the vanquished Titans were imprisoned. HESIOD. To this Prometheus here alludes.</note>
<note xml:id="note.21.h">Gaia, offended with her husband Ouranus for having impriſoned the braveſt of her fons, encouraged Saturn to revenge the affront, and armed him with a ſcythe of adamant, with which he diſmembered his father, then ſeized his throne. But having heard a prophecy that he in his turn ſhould be dethroned by one of his fons, to evade the completion of it, he ſwallowed down all his male offspring as foon as they were born, till at the birth of Jupiter, Rhea deceived him by a ſtrange device, and privately conveyed the child to Crete, where he was educated, and concealed till he was of age to appear in arms against his father. As Saturn was the youngest son of Ouranus, the two eldest, Titanus and Japetus, claimed their hereditary honours, and oppoſed the fovereignty of Jupiter. The war had now continued ten years without intermiſſion, and no proſpect of a deciſion appeared, when Jupiter released Briareus, Cottus, and Gyges, the fons whom Saturn had imprisoned, and by feasting them with nectar and ambrofia, ſecured their fidelity: these were of immense courage, ſtrength, and ſize, each had fifty heads and an bundred hands; by their aſſiſtance the Titans were totally defeated, and Jupiter acknowledged as the ſovereign of the ſky. Hefiod defſcribes this battle with wonderful ſublimity.</note>
<note xml:id="note.23.i">A multiplicity of names was a mark of dignity; but Themis could not with propriety be called Gaia, this our poet miſtook for Rhea. Gaia is the earth in its primitive uncultivated ſtate, terra inculta; Rhea is the earth in its improved ftate of cultivation, tellus culta: and as from this culture property arose, Juſtice had here her office, to aſſign and protect this property, fuum cuique: Themis therefore, as the goddess of Justice, might well have the appellation of Rhea. This is only to ſhow that we understand the mythology of the ancients much better than they did themselves.</note>
<note xml:id="note.24.k">We are not informed for what cauſe Jupiter was ſo offended with the unhappy race of mortals; but by way of punishment he withdrew from them παντέχνε πυρὸς σέλας, the firey flame, that lends its aid to every art: this Prometheus ſtole from heaven, and reconveyed to them in an hollow cane: hinc illæ lacrymæ,</note>
<note xml:id="note.27.l">Il paroît monté ſur je ne ſcai quel animal aîlé; bizarrerie inexplicable. Brumoy. Of this breed was the winged horfe of Aftolfo.-4th book, 13th c. Orlando Furioſo.</note>
<note xml:id="note.31.m">We have before ſeen one brother of Prometheus driven thunderftruck to Tartarus; we have here another of that unhappy family, the famous Atlas, condemned to ſupport in his arms the pillars of the heavens.</note>

<note xml:id="note.31.n">After the defeat of the Titans, Gaia, from an adventure with Tartarus, brought forth this her youngeſt ſon, the moſt enormous and moſt terrible of all the giant race: he had an hundred dragonheads; his eyes glared fire; from all his heads he uttered every horrid ſound, ſometimes intelligible to the gods, ſometimes the lowing of a bull, ſometimes the roaring of a lion, ſometimes the howl of dogs, ſometimes the hiſs of ſerpents: his force was ſo formidable, as alone to endanger the ſovereignty of the ſky, and to compel Jupiter to exert his whole ſtrength and all his vollied thunder, of which Hefiod has given us a noble deſcription. Happily for poetry, this monſter, inſtead of being driven down to Tartarus, was defeated in the plains of Sicily, where the mountain Ætna was hurled upon him. The genius of Hefiod ſeems to have taken fire from hence, and communicated the flame to Æschylus, Pindar, and Virgil.</note>

<note xml:id="note.35.o"> The chorus here alludes to the punishment of Menœtius
and Atlas mentioned before.</note>

<note xml:id="note.35.p"> This ſtanza and the next relate to Prometheus, the last to
Atlas. All Aſia lamented the ſufferings of the former; the
earth, the ſea, and the gloomy depths of Pluto ſympathize
with Atlas, for whilſt he bore the heavens on his ſhoulders,
all below must be violently preſſed beneath his feet.-
PAUW.</note>
<note xml:id="note.37.q">The tranſlator has followed the emendation of Pauw; ſo though ἀείσυροι be a proper and general epithet for the provident ants, who are therefore by Ovid ſtiled frugilegæ, and i is to the purpoſe of Horace, when he ſays of this little animal Ore trahit quodcunque poteſt, yet in this place it has no pertinent analogy to untutored barbarians dwelling in caves: i was not then the industrious forecast of the ant to which Æschylus had occaſion to allude, but its neſt ſcooped in the ground : ἀεισορος conveys the preciſe idea.</note>
<note xml:id="note.38.r"><p>Of the many advantages for which the tranſlator is indebted to Æschylus, the greatest and moſt valuable is the honour which he receives from the acquaintance of ſome perſons of the highest rank, and the moſt diſtinguiſhed eminence in literature; among these he is proud to reckon <emph>RICHARD PAUL JODRELL, Esq.</emph> This gentleman has been ſo kind as to communicate his own obſervations on one tragedy, the Siege of Thebes, with leave to the compiler of these notes to ſelect from them ſuch as might be found to coincide with his plan; a liberal uſe has been made of these, enough to make the reader regret that the preſſing call for this publication would not admit of a delay, till the ſame learned perſon's obſervations on the other tragedies could be reviſed; but ex pede Herculem.</p>
    <p>The tranflator had religiouſly adhered to his original in the δυσκρίτους δύσεις, v. 457. but was totally at a loſs to account for the ſuperior difficulty of marking the ſetting of the ſtars. He took the liberty to communicate his embarraſſment to Mr. Jodrell, and was immediately favoured with this clear and judicious ſolution of the paſſage. </p>
    <p>" It is difficult to afcertain the degree of knowledge, which the philofophers contemporary with Æschylus had of the fixed ſtars; for Hipparchus the Rhodian, who flourished only 120 years before Chriſt, which was near 420 years after the birth of Æschylus, was the firſt who dared to undertake a thing, which, ſays Pliny, seemed to ſurpaſs the power of a divinity, that of numbering the ſtars for poſterity, and reducing them to a rule. Because the civil year of the ancients did not correſpond with the apparent annual motion of the ſun, it was impoſſible by the calendar to aſcertain the preciſe times for the purpoſes of agriculture, as the fame day of the month would not happen in the ſame ſeaſon of the year; it was neceſſary therefore to have recourſe to more certain ſtandards and invariable characters to diſtinguiſh times, which the rifings and the ſettings of the ſtars naturally afforded: Prometheus, therefore, with great propriety might boast of this fignal and important diſcovery to mankind: of which Virgil, in his firſt Georgic, when he delivers his poetical precepts for the husbandman, makes a particular injunction, 

    <quote>
    <l>Præterea tam funt Arcturi fidera nobis,</l>
    <l>Hædorumque dies ſervandi, et lucidus anguis, &amp;c.</l>
</quote>
    Hefiod had before given precepts of a fimilar nature. "Now the rifing of a ſtar, as defined by Chryfippus, is its advancement above the earth, and its ſetting the occultation of it under the earth (See Stanley's Hiſtory of Philoſophy, part viii. c. 8.). And aſtronomers have divided the rifings and ſettings of ſtars, according to their technical expreſſions, into Coſmical, Achronical, and Heliacal, which are thus explained by Keil in his 19th lecture, p. 222. "A ſtar is faid to rise or ſet coſmically, which riſes or ſets when the ſun riſes; achronically, when it riſes while the ſun ſets, that is in the evening, when it is in oppoſition to the ſun, and is viſible all night; heliacally, when after it has been in conjunction with the ſun, and on that account inviſible, it comes to be at ſuch a diſtance from him as to be ſeen in the morning before ſunriſing, when the ſun, by his apparent motion, recedes from the ſtar towards the eaſt: but the Heliacal ſetting is, when the ſun approaches ſo near a ſtar, that it hides it with its beams, which keep the fainter light of the ſtar from being perceived." This I conceive to be the meaning of the poet in his epithet of δυσκρίτους, or 
    <quote><l part="F">—an harder ſcience yet,</l>
        <l part="I">Their ſetting.—</l></quote> 
        For by this philoſophical ſolution the obſervation of the ſettings of the ſtars must be attended with more difficulty than that of the rifings: this appears to me to be the moſt natural explication of this paſſage."</p></note>
<note xml:id="note.44.s">The chorus here alludes to the ſolemn annual feſtival, which the gods held with their father Oceanus, and at which they ſhowed their piety and reverence by their attendance and miniſtry.-Pauw. - See Homer, 1 Il. v. 423. with Mr. Pope's note.</note>
<note xml:id="note.46.t">The poet here introduces to us the moſt ſingular and illuf-
trious perſonage of ancient Greece, from whom the nobleſt fa -
milies were proud of deriving their pedigree; the bare men-
tion of her was a compliment to their vanity, and therefore
always well accepted; it had a peculiar propriety here, as it
prepared the Athenian ſpectator to receive her great de-
ſcendant Hercules, who was to appear in the next play, which
unhappily is loft. In the Supplicants we shall have occafion to
ſpeak more particularly of her.</note>
<note xml:id="note.47.u">So Ovid ſeems to have understood this paſſage,
    <cit>
<l>junctiſque canendo</l>
<l>Vincere arundinibus ſervantia lumina tentat.</l>
<l>And ſtill betwixt, his tuneful pipe he plies,</l>

<bibl>DRYDEN.</bibl>
</cit>
In her diſtraction ſhe thought ſhe ſaw the ſpectre of her
keeper Argos, ſhe thought she heard the found of the pipe
with which Mercury lulled all his hundred eyes to fleep.</note>
<note xml:id="note.48.x">Prometheus had mentioned her father's name, and the cauſe of her ſufferings; from whence Iö, rightly conceiving him to be a prophet, had requested him to tell her clearly what woes yet awaited her, and how they might be remedied: he anſwers, I will tell thee clearly, without that ænigmatical obſcurity which had rendered oracles famous for Darkutter'd anſwers of ambiguous ſenſe.</note>
<note xml:id="note.51.y">Inachus, the father of Iö, was the ſon of Oceanus and Tethys.</note>
<note xml:id="note.52.z">Iö tells her tale with great propriety, and by preſerving the decorum of her own character, conſults the dignity of her illustrious defcendants. The circumſtance of the viſion, and the influence of the god over her ſlumbers, is a fine ſtroke of nature, embelliſhed with a rich poetical imagination; Theſe are the daydreams of a maid in love. Ovid, who had no prejudice of highdefcended anceſtry to flatter, has taken the liberty to depart from this bienſeance; Pellicis argolicæ is a coarſe appellation, and his poem is ſo much the worſe for it.</note>
<note xml:id="note.53.a">The tranſlator hath here adopted the very judicious reading of Pauw with regard to Cenchrea; but notwithstanding his aliud melius et facilius tibi dabo, prefers the Λέρνης τε κρηνην of Canterus to his Λέρνης or Λερνην αδρην τε.</note>
<note xml:id="note.56.b">The horrid cuſtom of ſacrificing ſtrangers, whoſe ill fortune drove them on their coaſts, marks the ſavage and inhoſpitable manners of these barbarians.</note>
<note xml:id="note.56.c">Araxis.</note>
<note xml:id="note.57.d">Bosphorus, the paſſage of the heifer.</note>
<note xml:id="note.57.e">The Chorus had declared themselves to be deeply affected at the narrative of Iö; Prometheus therefore, having enumerated more and greater woes which yet awaited her, addreſſes them thus: Think you that this tyrant of the ſkies is of a fierce and headlong violence, when he has thus driven a mortal, even whilſt he is a ſuiter for her love, to these wanderings? Then turning to the unhappy ſufferer, he ſays, A rugged woer, virgin, have thy charms Won thee. There is in this a malignant triumph, well ſuited to the implacable reſentment of the ſpeaker, which would not allow him to acknowledge that Jupiter did not voluntarily inflict these miſeries on his favourite fair, but that with great reluctance he was obliged to make this ſacrifice to the jealous and enraged Juno.</note>
<note xml:id="note.59.f">This is one of those fine touches which distinguiſh a mafter's hand. Iö had been cruelly treated, and was ſinking even to deſperation under the ſenſe of the miſeries which ſhe was yet to ſuffer, when she was told that her rugged woer, from whom alt her afflictions arose, ſhould one day be deprived of the ſovereignty of heaven. Here, instead of that pleaſure with which it was ſuppoſed the predicted event would fill her indignant mind, her concealed love juſt riſes to ſoften her reſentment, and then, fearful of a diſcovery, hides itſelf. beneath her conſcious dignity, and the modest reſerve of her ſex: nay, the very queſtions which she afterwards aſks, apparently to ſhow her joy for the ruin of Jupiter, diſcover the moſt delicate tincture of tender and delicate ſenſibility.</note>

This hiſtory, he ſays, relates to an Amonian temple founded in the extreme parts of Africa, in which there were three prieſteſſes of Canaanitiſh race, who on that account are said to be in the ſhape of ſwans, that bird being the infigne of their nation. The notion of their having but one eye among them took its riſe from an hieroglyphic very common in Egypt, and probably in Canaan: this was the repreſentation of an eye, which was said to be engraved upon the pediment of their temples. This may have been one reaſon, among others, why the Cyclopians and Arimaſpians are repreſented with one eye,

<note xml:id="note.77.n">It is not neceſſary to ſend the ladies to Pindar for their information in this celestial anecdote, as our courtly Lanfdowne in his Maſk of Peleus and Thetis is ready to diſcover the ſecret. Jupiter beheld the charms of Thetis, daughter of Oceanus, with the eye of a lover, and intended to advance her as his confort to the imperial throne of Heaven. Now it was in the Fates that this lady ſhould have a ſon, who was to be greater than his father. Prometheus alone, by his divine forefight, could open the danger to Jupiter; but this he firmly refused to do, till he ſhould be released from the rock. After that Hercules, by the permiſſion of Jupiter, had killed the tormenting eagle, and unbound his chains, he diſclosed the decree of the Fates: Thetis was giver marriage to Peleus, and the prophecy was accompliſhed in the famous Achilles.</note>

<note xml:id="note.79.o">The ſcholiaſt explains this paſſage by ſaying, that whoever ſhould attempt to fuccour Prometheus, and deliver him from his pain, ſhould himself be ſent to the ſhades of Orcus, and the dark abyſs of Tartarus. The words are very remarkable; for want of a better explication of them, we must take up with this.</note>
<note xml:id="note.81.p">The Chorus throughout this tragedy find themſelves in a
very delicate and difficult ſituation. Confanguinity and affection brought them to the rock to commiſerate the afflictions of Prometheus; hence they became intereſted in the action: as his ſufferings were unjuſt, their office, which led them to favour the good, led them alſo to expreſs their diſapprobation of his puniſhment; but as it was inflicted by Jupiter, their piety and reverence would not permit them to oppoſe the king of the gods; all that remained for them was to condole with him, to give him friendly counſel, and to ſoften his inflamed reſentment: their character is preſerved with wonderful propriety and decorum. Even at the laſt, when nothing could prevail with him to abate his implacable ſpirit, and Mercury with much tenderneſs adviſed them to retire, and avoid the impending ſtorm, they anſwer with a becoming firmneſs, that they could not be guilty of ſuch a deed of baſeneſs; ancient manners, which conſidered the deſertion of a friend as the vileſt of actions, required this ſacrifice of their own ſafety.

<note xml:id="note.91.a">Danaus, the fourth in deſcent from Iö, had fifty daughters; his brother Ægyptus had fifty fons. It was much for the intereſt of Ægyptus to unite the families and the kingdoms, by marrying his fons to the daughters of his brother; but the propoſal, which was urged with such violence and rudeness, was ſo diſagreeable to Danaus and his female train, that they failed from the mouth of the Nile, and ſought refuge on the coaft of Greece, where we find them just arrived.</note>
<note xml:id="note.92.b">The laws of ancient Greece were ſevere, not fanguinary, till Draco; they permitted even the murderer to atone for his crime by banishment, which often was voluntary, ſometimes the punishment inflicted by the ſtate; there are many inſtances in Homer; in Statius Tydeus, ſtain'd with a brother's blood, fled a voluntary exile to the court of Adraſtus: hence the Furies, declaring their office to Minerva, tell her 'Tis ours to drive the murderer from the houſe. Tyndarus, in the Electra of Euripides, urges this ſtrongly against Oreſtes, Deaf to the call of juſtice he infring'd The firm authority of the public laws; For when beneath my daughter's murdering axe The royal Agamemnon bow'd his head, He ought to have call'd the laws, the righteous laws, 'T' avenge the blood, and by appeal to them Have driven his mother from this princely manſion: Thus 'midst his ills calm reaſon had borne rule, Juſtice had held its courſe, and he been righteous.</note>
<note xml:id="note.93.c">We have here indubitable marks of a colony moving from Ægypt to fettle in Greece; and as these emigrants came forward under the auspices of their tutelary Iſis, we might well expect to find the ſymbol of that goddess. The national vanity of the Grecians was hurt to ſee these ſtrangers give birth to an illustrious line of kings and heroes, whoſe glory eclipſed that of their own Autocthones; but their lively imagination ſoon found a remedy for this; it created a daughter from their Inachus, dreſſed her out with every charm that might engage the love of Jupiter, tranſmuted the ſymbolical into a real heifer, and ſent her into Ægypt, there to bring forth the famous Epaphus. Now these emigrants might be received with a good grace, as being originally of Argive extraction; and Greece, in return for a colony, gratuitouſly preſented Ægypt with a goddess.</note>

<note xml:id="note.97.f">There is a difficulty in the original, owing probably to a corrupted text, which no annotator has yet cleared; the general idea is very obvious, ſupplicants fly for protection to the altars of the gods, which afford refuge even in the violence of war. Plutarch expreſſes the ſame ſentiment, ἔςι διύλῳ φέυξιμος βωμὸς. καὶ πολεμίας φεύγονθες, ἂν ἀγάλμαλις λάβωθαι ἤ ναΐυ, θαρρᾶσιι. De Superſtitione.

But further than this, they drew their auguries of ſucceſs from this bird: thus the Bœotians formed a joyful preſage of their glorious victory over the Lacedæmonians at Leuctra, from the crowing of the cocks during all the preceding night; for the cock, when he has conquered his rival, proclaims his victory with loud and cheerful crowings; but if conquered, he hides himself in filence.-Verderii imagines deorum.

Mr. Addison, in his Cato, has expreſſed the ſame idea in these charming lines, The glowing dames of Zama's royal court Have faces fluſh'd with more exalted charms : The fun, that rolls his chariot o'er their heads,..

<note xml:id="note.115.q">The addreſs of theſe virgins here deſerves our attention :
their father, knowing the quick and volatile temper of the
Grecians, had warned them not to let their anſwers weary the
ear; Pelaſgus had given them the fame admonition; hence
the Chorus ſays, " brief will I be, and plain :" and thus far
indeed all her replies have a modest brevity and preciſion; here
a trying queſtion had been put to her, which could not be
    evaded; but as her ſucceſs depended on the reception her
anfwer ſhould meet with, ſhe awakes the attention of the
king by a fine moral ſentiment, and having thus prepared
his mind gives him a direct anſwer, by applying the force of
it to her own cafe. There is exquisite art in this.
</note>
<note xml:id="note.120.r">There is great propriety in this plea, to which Pelaſgus was naturally led by Grecian ideas, arifing from the laws of that country, where orphan virgins were to marry their nearest of kin, and ſuch were ordered to take them to wife: Lex eft, ut orbæ, qui fint genere proximi, Eis nubant: et illos ducere eadem hæc lex jubet.- TER.

<note xml:id="note.121.s">The Athenians, and indeed all the ſtates of Greece, were animated with the nobleft and most generous ſpirit of liberty, and the ſtrongest abhorrence of a tyrant; for by that name they denoted the man who had ufurped the fupreme power, and turned the free democracy into a monarchy. Non quia crudelis ille, sed quoniam grave Omne infuetis onus. Nay, proud as they were of their own ancient kings, they could not bear to allow them a power inconſiſtent with their free laws, the right which every citizen claimed of giving his voice in the public council, and adding his fanction to the measures which the king was to carry into execution, only in obedience to the will of the people. We have many instances of this generous enthusiasm.</note>

<note xml:id="note.129.u">The ſacred groves were incloſed; the Chorus therefore properly aſks what protection an unconfecrated grove could afford: the anſwer ſhows, that the ſtate would defend them, and they needed not that hallowed aſylum; yet as the danger came upon them before they could be removed by a decree of the ſtate, they fled for refuge to the ſacred grove.</note>

<note xml:id="note.144.g">As the Chorus had compared the ſons of Egyptus to ravening dogs, Danaus expreſſes the Grecians by wolves, as ſtronger and fiercer animals; perhaps it would be too great a refinement, with Stanley, to derive the former alluſion from their Anubis, and the latter from the Apollo Λύκειος.

<note xml:id="note.148.h">The timid modeſty of these virgins, and the ſober piety of Danaus, are finely contraſted with the brutal inſolence and facrilegious violence of the Ægyptian herald: this carries the diſsreſs to its greatest height, raiſes our pity and terror, and adds a peculiar luſtre to the calm dignity of Pelaſgus in the next ſcene.</note>

But the tranſlator is not to be bantered out of this reading by the Attic wit, nor to be beat out of by the Γυμφοδέλῳ δορί, the σκηπίρῳ ήλοισι πεπαρμένῳ Heathii. This whole ſcene is so difficult, and ſo miſerably mutilated, that the reader of Æschylus is under the greatest obligations to Pauw for his free and manly conjectures. If he has not always hit on the true reading, he has at least given a probable and ingenious one, and added ſenſe and ſpirit to that rude and undigeſted maſs, from which none before had been extunded.</note>
<note xml:id="note.155.k">Pelaſgus had before gently rebuked the herald for the impropriety of his conduct; he had landed on a foreign ſhore, and advanced without asking the protection of any of the natives, and without reverencing the sanctity of the place; he rudely answers, I found here what I had lost, and I will seize it: being commanded not to touch the virgins, he has recourse to his sacred office, and promises to explain himself clearly; but instead of this abruptly declares, that Mars decides not by evidence, and at once threatens war: this is a strong mark of the impetuous and lawless violence of the sons of Ægyptus. Perhaps the critical taste of Pauw may be acknowledged in this remark.

had carried off Europa, the daughter of Agenor king of
Phœnicia, the diſconfolate father ſent his fon Cadmus in

ſearch of her, commanding him not to return unleſs he found
her. Cadmus having wandered over the world in vain, con-
ſulted the Oracle of Apollo at Delphos; the answer of the
God was,

He obeyed. Some of his attendants were ſent to a river nigh
the place, to bring living water for a facrifice which he was
preparing to Jupiter; an immenſe dragon rufhed from his cave
and killed them: Cadmus, to revenge the death of his
friends, fought with this dragon and flew him; then, by the
admonition of Minerva, he ſowed the teeth of the dragon in
the ground, from which an host of men completely armed fud-
denly aroſe; theſe furiouſly attacked each other, till only five
of the number remained alive: peace was made between
them, and Cadmus aſſociated them to his train. The The-
bans afterwards were proud of deriving ſome of their best fa-
milies from this dragon race. Cadmus now built Thebes,
and having eſtabliſhed his colony, married Harmonia, the
daughter of Mars and Venus; all the Gods attended at the
nuptials, and each honoured the bride with ſome preſent.

The man being naked marks the contempt with which Capaneus treated the enemy, and implies that he needed no arms to attack and fire the city.-R. P. JODRELL. These obſervations are in the genuine ſpirit of criticiſm, and ſhow great penetration and judgment: Euripides could give this torchbearer the name of Prometheus only as a mestonymy; and from this custom arose that bold metaphor which we ſhall find in the Perſians, Σάλπιγξ ἀυθῇ ἐπέφλεγεν, and the Martemque accendere cantu of Virgil.</note>

She had two temples at Thebes, from which ſhe had two titles, Oncæa and Iſmenia; the latter certainly derived from the river Iſmenus. See Œdip. Tyr.

loſes all temper; he begins indeed as if he would lament the
unhappy fate of his family, but foon ſtarts from that idea, and
though himself the aggreſſor, reviles his brother as infolent,
outrageous, and unjust from his infancy; then in the ſpirit of

<note xml:id="note.228.p">The Engliſh reader will allow, that in variety of character and dignity of expreſſion this is one of the fineſt ſcenes ever produced by dramatic author. The devices on the shields, the ſpirit of the warriors, and the defiance of Eteocles, all proclaim that wonderful δεινοτής, or tragic ſublimity, which characteriſed Æschylus. What can we think then of the unfeeling criticiſm of P. Brumoy? who ſays, Cette ſcene eſt fort longue, et n'a pu être intereſſante que pour les Atheniens qui connoiſſoient Thebes, et les chefs, dont on va parler.-R. P. JODRELL.</note>
<note xml:id="note.228.q">As foon as Oedipus came to be informed that he had killed his father Laius, and that Jocasta, by whom he had two fons and two daughters, was his mother, in the tranſport of his grief he tore out his eyes. When his ſons were grown up to man's estate, they ſhut up their father now old and blind, and agreed to divide his kingdom between them: Oedipus deeply reſented this treatment, and uttered the moſt horrid execrations against them, praying that they might divide the kingdom by the ſword. Statius knew how to make a fine uſe of this. How fatal a father's curſe was eſteemed, we have ſeen in the Prometheus. To prevent its dreaded effects, the brothers agreed to reign each a year alternately, and each alternately to leave the kingdom: Eteocles, as the elder, firſt affumed the ſovereignty; but upon the expiration of his year refuſed to reſign it to his brother: hence this war, their father's prophetic curſe, which is greatly repreſented through this tragedy as an avenging fury: even the ſword is perſonified, and repreſented as a rude barbarian from the mines of Scythia, and advancing over the ſeas, attended with miſchief and war, as a cruel umpire to divide the kingdom between the brothers, but aſſigning to each no larger a ſhare than their dead bodies could occupy on the earth. These are the conceptions of a genius truly ſublime, and which distinguiſh Æschylus and Shakespear from all other writers.</note>

                    inſpiration, from the dark and diſtant hint,
                    through all the noble imagery of the prophetic
                    enthuſiaſm; till, as the catastrophe advances,
                    the more and more plainly declares it: As a
                    ſuffering princeſs, her grief is plaintive, lively,
                    and piercing; yet ſhe goes to meet her death,
                    which ſhe clearly foretells, with a firmneſs
                    worthy the daughter of Priam
                    and the ſiſter of Hector: Nothing can be
                    more animated or more intereſting than this
                    ſcene. The conduct of the poet through this
                    play is exquifitely judicious; every ſcene gives
                    us ſome obſcure hint, or ominous preſage,
                    enough to keep our attention always raiſed,
                    and
              <pb n="5"/>  
                
                    and to prepare us for the event; even the
                    ſtudied caution of <persName>Clytemnestra</persName> is finely managed
                    to produce that effect; whilſt the ſecreſy, with
                    which ſhe conducts her deſign, keeps us in
                    ſuſpenſe, and prevents a diſcovery, till we hear
                    the dying groans of her murdered husband.
                    It is to be lamented that a late amiable
                    poet, in his tragedy on this ſubject, which
                    too he wiſhed to have eſteemed as claſſical,
                    ſhould have deviated ſo far from his great
                    original, particularly in the character of <persName>Clytemneſtra</persName>:
                    but as he wanted ſtrength of
                    genius to imitate the noble ſimplicity of
                    <persName>Æschylus</persName>, his taſte led him to take <persName>Seneca</persName> for
                    his model; and he has ſucceeded accordingly.
                    The ſcene of this play is at <placeName>Argos</placeName>, before
                    the palace of <persName>Agamemnon</persName>.</p>

And of this ode, <hi rend="i">l'on peut bien défier toute plume Françoise de rendre ce morceau, tant il eſt defiguré et entortillé</hi>.

                <p>The Chorus, ſeized with a ſacred inſpiration, records the omen which was given to the brother kings on their march from Argos. Two eagles, the one of dark plumage, the ſtrongeſt and the ſwifteſt of the kind, the other of a ſpecies ſomewhat inferior, ſeize a pregnant hare, and bear it in their talons to the palace of Agamemnon.</p>

It was in the Fates, that Edipus ſhould kill his father, and marry his mother; by the very methods which he took to avoid the completion of this oracle, and those the wiſeſt which human providence could ſuggeſt, he was entangled in the fatal net; yet the anger of the Gods purſued him even to ruin, and the extermination of his family.

So here Agamemnon has this cruel alternative proposed to him, either to appease the anger of Diana, and purchase a favourable wind by the blood of his daughter, or to see this great armament of united Greece, her heroes, and her glory, unprofitably wasted at Aulis: yet even the Chorus here, though under the influence of the strongest religious impressions, instead of extolling the hero for suffering the patriot passions to prevail over private affection, censure the deed, though acknowledged to be necessary, as audacious, mad, and unholy.

                <p>Paris had been guilty of the moſt atrocious act of injustice to Menelaus ; all Greece had united to revenge the affront, and had choſen Agamemnon as the commander in chief of this mighty armament ; he had carried on a great and dangerous war for ten years ; was brave, wise, and juſt, had ſubverted the empire of Priam, and raiſed the military fame of his country to the highest glory ; was now returning crowned with conquest, and enriched with ſpoils, the moſt illustrious of mortal men: might we not then expect that his faithful ſenators, who loved and honoured him, ſhould have celebrated the victories of their king, and welcomed his return to Argos with pæans of joy? Instead of this, they dwell on the miſeries  of the war, the unhappiness of families which, instead of their lords, had received back only their arms stained with their blood, or urns containing their ashes, the murmurs of the people, and the severe retaliation demanded for blood, even though shed in a just war: in short, all their ideas, and even their moral reflections, are gloomy and of ill presage. But the great poet knew what he was about: the character of the Chorus was sacred, their claim of inspiration had rendered it prophetic, they were not therefore to be dazzled with the vain splendor of triumphs immediately before them ; but their minds were carried forward to future events, and there every presage was dark and melancholy ; and by this judicious conduct we are further prepared for the catastrophe.</p>

                <p>Mr. Heath attributes to the Chorus the part here aſſigned to Clytemneſtra. He thinks it unbecoming the dignity of the queen, and that the Herald anſwers too familiarly: this miſtake led him into many others. The Herald’s meſſage  was was directly to the queen; and as he bore a ſacred character, her dignity did not ſuffer by the conference ; neither is there any thing of diſreſpectful familiarity on his part: ancient manners permitted not the Chorus to interrupt the queen. The fifth line of p. 48 , is an evaſive anſwer: this artful woman wiſhed to appear to the Herald, and by him to be repreſented as having ſuffered much during her husband’s abſence; being aſked, By whom? She replies with an affected caution, That ſilence had been her beſt remedy. What seems to have miſled this learned critic, was his opinion that the Chorus hinted at the infamous commerce between Clytemneſtra and Ægiſtheus ; but the words on which he firſt founds his opinion, v. 555 of the original, have a very different meaning: the herald ſays, You deſire to ſee those, who have as great a deſire to ſee this country; ſhe answers , 
                    <quote><l>Such, that I oft have breath'd the ſecret ſigh.</l></quote>
                     Mr. Heath derives another proof from the word κλύοντας, ν. 589 , which being maſculine and plural, ſhows that the Herald had been addreſſing not Clytemneſtra, but the Chorus: it rather ſhows, that this part of his diſcourſe had been addreſſed both to Clytemneſtra and the Chorus ; had he ſpoke to the Chorus only, only, he would have used the singular number, as he does twice afterwards, when the queen had left them,</p>

                    Ἐκύρσας, ὥστε τοξότης ἄκρος, σκοποῦ.</l></quote> <bibl>v. 637.</bibl></cit>

                <p>Nor is his critique on νικώμενος, tranſlated " I am convinced," better founded ; for this is a modest apology for their diftruſt of Clytemneſtra’s news, expreſſed in the last epode; to which ſhe replies ſarcastically, p. 51. 1.7. Mr. Heath finiſhes, by interpreting the 4th and 5th lines of p. 53 , as if the Chorus insinuated that Clytemneſtra had ſpoke with artful diﬃmulation what ſhe wiſhed the Herald ſhould relate to the king ; and thereby hinted at her infidelity : but the words of the original are clear and expreſs, and incapable of admitting any other ſenſe than what the tranſlation preſents. Indeed nothing could be more unhappily conceived than the opinion of these intimations from the Chorus, as it is repugnant to the whole plan and conduct of the play.</p>

                <p>If the reader is not satisfied with Pauw's interpretation of this passage, nor with the translator's, Mr. Heath is at hand, who renders it thus, "The dews wet us, the certain destruction of our garments, making our hair like the shag of wild beasts." [GRC: I assume he is translating Heath's Latin edition?]  One would imagine that this learned person had Nebuchadnezzar in his thoughts, but that the hairs of the Assyrian monarch were grown like eagles' feathers. If by ἔνθηρον τρίχα we understand the ſhaggy coverings of the tents, we shall find it a good military idea.</p>

                <p>Pauw cenſures the poet here as inconſiſtent, the Herald having before declared it improper to profane a day ſacred to feſtal joy with ill tidings : Mr. Heath defends him, by ſaying the tidings are rather of good than of ill : but this is directly contrary to the Herald’s words, who ſpeaks of tempeſts, wrecks, bodies floating on the waves, and the anger of the Gods, as ills ; and ſuch to common underſtandings they muſt appear : indeed he ſeems apprehenſive of this, yet thinks them very proper, as these unfortunate circumstances give a preſage of the impending death of Agamemnon ; at the same time they give it an air of probability, by rendering the king more obnoxious to the treacheries of Clytemneſtra, as being returned with one ſingle ſhip, without his friends and the army. Thus Mr. Heath; but it appears by the barbarous boaſt of Clytemneſtra, after ſhe had perpetrated the horrid deed, that ſhe had planned it in ſuch a manner, at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place, that the execution of it could not be prevented. The poet had a deeper deſign: though the dramatic unities had not their name in his time, yet they owe their exiſtence to him, and he was as ſensible, as any of his critics can be, of the impropriety of making Agamemnon appear at Argos the day after Troy was taken ; yet his plan required this, and it is ſo finely executed, that he must be a critic <hi rend="i">minorum gentium</hi> who objects to it. The whole narration of the Herald is calculated to ſoften this impropriety ; a tempeſt ſeparates the royal ſhip from the fleet, ſome God preſerves it, and Fortune, the deliverer, guides it into the harbour ; every thing is as rapid and impetuous as the genius of Æschylus, and the expreſſion is ſo carefully guarded, that no hint is given of the veſſel’s being at ſea more than one night: there are ſome ſubſequent expreſſions of the same tendency.</p>

                <p>The general deſign of this beautiful ode is ſo clear, that it wants no elucidation : the ſober and religious moral, that breathes through the richest deſcription and most vivid colouring, gives it the highest grace and the utmoſt perfection to which poetry can aſpire.

Tragedy was not yet allowed to lose fight of reverence to the Gods, the love of liberty, and affection to their country, principles the moſt neceſſary to be inculcated on the people. Agamemnon could not return the gratulations of his faithful ſenators, till he had addreſſed his paternal land, and its Gods, who had led him to this war, and brought him back in ſafety.

                <p>According to the ſimplicity of ancient manners, Clytemneſtra ſhould have waited to receive her husband in the houſe; but her affected fondneſs led her to diſregard decorum. Nothing can be conceived more artful than her ſpeech; but that very art ſhews, that her heart had little ſhare in it: her pretended ſufferings during his abſence are touched with great delicacy and tenderneſs; but had they been real, ſhe would not have ſtopped him here with the querulous recital: the joy for his return, had ſhe felt that joy, would have broke out firſt; this is deferred to the latter part of her addreſs; there indeed ſhe has amaſſed every image expreſſive of welcome; but her ſolicitude to aſſemble these leads her beyond nature, which expreſſes her ſtrongeſt paſſions in broken ſentences, and with a nervous brevity, not with the cold formality of a ſet harangue. Her laſt words are another inſtance of the double ſenſe which expreſſes reverence to her husband, but intends the bloody deſign with which her ſoul was agitated.</p>

                <p>Geryon was a king of Spain, killed by Hercules, fabled to have three bodies, becauſe he had three armies commanded by his three ſons. Clytemneſtra compares her husband to this giant, and ſays, that if he had been ſlain as often as was reported, this ſecond triple Geryon (meaning Agamemnon under that name, for it were ominous to ſpeak of the dead) might well boaſt to have received his triple veſt, meaning his three bodies, and to have died once in each form. Mr. Heath might never have heard that Geryon, though he had three bodies, died more than once; nor does Pauw ſay it; but this does not hinder Clytemneſtra from making the ſuppoſition, and nothing more is intended; the words of Æschylus are expreſs, </p>

                <p>This paſſage is difficult. The context is this, whilſt the root remains (meaning the husband) the branches reach to the houſe, and ſpread a ſhade over it againſt the heat of the dog-ſtar. There is an image of this nature in Caractacus far ſuperior to this of Æschylus, Hail, hallow’d oaks! — Happy foreſters, Ye, with your tough and interwiſted roots, Grasp the firm rocks ye ſprung from, and, erect In knotty hardihood, ſtill proudly ſpread Your leafy banners ’gainſt the tyrannous north, Who Roman like aſſails you. Clytemneſtra goes on, When thou art preſent at thy domeſtic hearth, thou ſpreadeſt a warmth even in the winter; and in the hottest season the husband’s preſence gives a refreshing coolneſs to the house; the firſt image is of protection, the other two of agreeableness, like this of Ovid, Solibus hibernis, aeſtivâ gratior umbrâ. The expreſſion in the original is highly metaphorical, “when Jupiter forms the wine from the unripe grape,” which means more than to denote the autumnal heat; it being no uncommon thing for an original rusticity of conception to be turned into parade and ornament. And now, having mentioned her husband under the usual epithet of the perfect (See Stanley on the Supp. v. 82. and on this place: hence their Ζεὺς τέλειος, and Ἥρη τέλεια, as presiding over marriages), she artfully addresses Jupiter, as the source of perfection, to perfect her intent: this play on the word is the ebullition of her heated imagination, impatient to execute her horrid purpose, as the opportunity was now arrived; and is another instance of that ambiguity with which this artful and determined woman took a pride in concealing her thoughts under the very words that expressed them. The learned reader is sufficiently sensible of the difficulty of this strophe; the translator understands it differently from the annotators, adhering however to Pauw's interpretation of time and place, which is supported against Mr. Heath by the two last lines. The Chorus, under the power of an immediate inspiration, in the sublimest style of poetry, is struck with visions of terror, Δεῖγμα προσατήριον, that fill his heart with presages, and compel him to utter the prophetic strain ἀκέλευσος, ἄμισθος. Indeed no hope, in which he could confide, had touched his heart since the fleet sailed from Aulis, and the troops advanced to Troy.</p>

This ode is conceived in the sublimest spirit of poetry, yet that is but its second excellence; it receives its first grace from propriety. As the odes in this tragedy necessarily contract an obscurity from their prophetic turn, and have been generally complained of as being almost unintelligible, the reader, it is hoped, will not be displeased at these attempts to elucidate them.</p>

Hercules took him to the top of an high tower, and bade him look around to ſee if he could diſcover them; but Iphitus not ſeeing them, Hercules ſaid that he was wrongfully accuſed, and threw the prince from the tower: being ſeized with some malady, as a punishment for this murder, and the uſual expiations not availing, he consulted the oracle of Apollo, who told him that he must publicly sell himself for a slave, and send the money arising from the sale to the children of Iphitus: his malady continuing, he went into Asia, there voluntarily suffered one of his friends to sell him, and became the slave of Omphale, daughter of Jardanus, and queen of the Meonians.

                <p>Tereus, king of Thrace, had married Procne, the daughter of Pandion king of Athens: afterwards, inflamed with luſt, he deflowered Philomela, the ſiſter of Procne, and to prevent a diſcovery cut out her tongue, and confined her in a hunting-feat in a wood; the injured lady wrought her story in the loom, and contrived to send the web to her siſter. Procne, pretending the rites of Bacchus, attended with a female train, burst open the gates of the lodge, and carried her siſter to the palace; there they killed Itys, the son of Tereus and Procne, and served him up as a feast to his father; when he had satiated his hunger, and called for his son, Procne told him what she had done; Philomela, at the same time, besmeared with blood, rushed into the room, and threw the head of Itys in his face. Tereus pursuing the siſters with his drawn sword was changed into a Lapwing, Procne into a Swallow, and Philomela into a Nightingale. Thus Ovid tells the story; but Æschylus, and after him Euripides and Sophocles, repreſent Procne as changed into the Nightingale.</p>

                <p>This is the finest image that ever entered a poet's imagination; the words seem incapable of any other interpretation than what is here given them; accordingly Grotius translates them thus,

                    Only for βολᾶις, Stanley wishes to read μόλις, Pauw λωβᾶις; the translator too has his conjecture. Then comes Mr. Heath, and makes a difficulty where no one ever suspected one; he retains the obnoxious word βολᾶις, on which to build his criticism; and to our great surprize, we are suddenly entertained with a game of backgammon; if the cast be a good one, as the dice are easily overturned, so human prosperity is subverted even by a shadow: if the cast be unlucky, then a sponge wipes out the unfortunate condition of those that threw it: by γραφήν he would willingly understand the figures impressed on the sides of the dice; but as these may not so easily be wiped out with a sponge, he is well inclined to think, that it means the chalk with which the players of ancient, as well as modern times, scored their games. It is peculiarly unfortunate, that this learned person could find nothing to his purpose in Pollux, Meursius, Salmasius, and Souterius, whom he consulted on this occasion. But this is not the first time this favourite annotator put his extinguisher over the flaming spirit of Æschylus. </p>

trance of Clytemneſtra. Having perpetrated the bloody deed,
the throws off the disguise, and appears at once in her real
character, determined and daring in her deſigns, calm, intrepid, and bidding defiance to the conſequences. She triumphs
in the deed, and takes a pride in recounting her deep-laid
treachery, and the particulars of its execution. Not fatisfied
with killing her husband, the mangled him when dead, which ſhe calls a facrifice to Pluto, and glories in the blood with
which ſhe was ſtained; nay, would decency permit it, ſhe
would even make libations over the dead, which Mr. Heath
judicioufly explains, by telling us, that it was a cuſtom among
the ancients after the defeat of their enemies, to pour libations
to the Gods their deliverers, in gratitude for their victory and
freedom. Thus Hector fays, Il. vi. ult.

<note xml:id="note.114.r"><p>As the ſwan, living or dying, is a very unmuſical bird, it
has been the ſubject of wonder whence the idea of his melody
at his death ſhould arife. Lucian is very pleasant on the occa-
fion ; the κύκνειον ἆσμα became a proverb; and not only the
poets, but even grave and philoſophical writers have ſuffered
themselves to be led away by it. The reader, who may not

places where the emigrants from Canaan, whoſe infigne was
the ſwan, ſettled, they were famous for their hymns and
mufic: all which the Greeks transferred to birds, and fup-

pleaſed with the music of ſwans, and when Æschylus mentions
their finging their own dirges, they certainly allude to Egyp-
tian and Canaanitiſh priests, who lamented the death of Adon
and Ofiris." Analyſis, vol. i. p. 380.-Hence our incom-

                <p>The Chorus had before compared together the deeds of these two daughters of Tyndarus: Helena had destroyed many in the fields of Troy, Clytemnestra one man, but one of such dignity, that he was equivalent to many; the comparison is here continued, that the baleful spirit which breathed through the house of Tantalus, had steeled these royal sisters to deeds of equal daring-HEATH.</p>
                <p>Clytemnestra had said before, that the avenging Fury of Atreus had sacrificed the man for the children; the Chorus here replies, may an avenging Fury arise from the father to vindicate his cause: the words are express, and so understood by Pauw: Mr. Heath explains them by the old Fury of Atreus before mentioned: the μέλας Αρης next following is, in the language of Æschylus, the sword, and gives an obscure, but sublime prophecy of the vengeance of Orestes; Mr. Heath renders it, niger discordiæ genius, carrying its rage to such an height, as to strike horror even into him that devoured his own sons: Pauw translates it pruinam et frigus puero voraci, i. e. Oresti, præbebit: the difficulty lies in the word κεροβορῳ, and will not readily be cleared up. Mr. Heath might have spared his ungentlemanlike censures of Pauw, had he recollected that so horrid a design in Orestes as the murder of his mother, must have a natural tendency to <hi rend="italic">freeze his young blood</hi>.</p>

        <p>THE Chorus in the former play, with
          a dignity and firmneſs becoming ſenators of Argos, had expreſſed their abhorrence
          of the murder of Agamemnon even to the
          face of Clytemneſtra and Ægisthus, and
          threatened them with the anger of the Gods
          and the vengeance of Oreſtes: this is here
          executed.
        </p><p>
          The characters of Oreſtes and Electra are
          finely ſupported. A pious reſentment of the
          murder of his father, a conſciouſneſs of his
   
          
        <pb n="134"/>
       
        own high rank, and a juſt indignation at the
          injuries he had received from the murderers,
          a generous deſire to deliver his country from
          the tyranny of theſe uſurpers, and above all
          the expreſs command of Apollo, with a promiſe of his protection if he obeyed, and a denunciation of the ſevereſt puniſhments ſhould
          he dare to diſobey, incited Oreſtes to this
          deed: he is accordingly drawn as a man of
          a brave and daring ſpirit, touched with the
          higheſt ſenſe of honour, and the moſt religious reverence of the Gods: in ſuch a character there could be nothing ſavage and ferocious; and we are pleaſed to find him
          deeply ſenſible of the horror of the deed
          which he was obliged to perpetrate, and
          averſe to plunge his ſword into the breast of
          his mother. <quote>Electra's character (in the
          words of the critic) is that of a fierce and
           determined, but withal of a generous and
           virtuous woman. Her motives to revenge
          
          were, principally, a ſtrong ſenſe of juſtice,
           and ſuperior affection for a father; not a
           rooted, unnatural averſion to a mother.
           She acted, as appears, not from the perturbation
        <pb n="135"/>

       of a tumultuous revenge, but
           from a fixed abhorrence of wrong, and a
           virtuous ſenſe of duty.</quote> Conſiſtently with
          this character, when ſhe had given Oreſtes a
          ſpirited account of their father's murder,
          which drew him to declare his reſolution to
          revenge it, ſhowing at the ſame time ſome
          ſign of remorſe, ſhe adds a ſhort relation of the
          barbarous indignities offered to the dead body;
          a deed of horror which, ſhe knew, would
          ſhock his ſoul. She had ſeen her father murdered, his body mangled, and buried without
          its honours; her brother, whom ſhe loved
          with the tendereſt affection, deprived of his
          throne, and exiled from his country; her
          mother in the arms of Ægisthus abandoning
          herſelf to her looſe and infamous pleaſures;
          ſhe was herſelf continually expoſed to the inſults and barbarous treatment of this ungentle
          mother; what wonder then that a ſpirit naturally lofty and ſenſible ſhould catch fire at
          theſe injuries, contract a wolfish fierceneſs, as
          ſhe expreſſes it, and urge her brother to ſacrifice theſe proud oppreſſors to juſtice and revenge? But the poet, with great regard to 
          
        <pb n="136"/>
        
        decorum, removes her from the ſcene before the
          dreadful deed is to be committed: with regard to his management of the catastrophe,
          nothing could be more judicious. Oreſtes,
          who had ruſhed on Ægisthus with the fury of
          a tyger, in the preſence of his mother feels
          himſelf under the reſtraint of filial reverence,
          and confeſſes his reluctance to ſhed her blood;
          till Pylades animates him with a ſentence as
          ſolemn as the Delphic Oracle; which finely
          marks the fatal blow as an act of neceſſary juſtice, not of ruffian violence. Even the Chorus, who enter warmly into the intereſts of
          Electra and Oreſtes, and had fired him to revenge by every argument of duty, juſtice, law,
          and honour; who had wiſhed to hear the dying groans of the guilty tyrants, and to echo
          them back in notes as diſmal, after the deed
          is done, reſſume the ſofter ſentiments of humanity, and lament their fate. The remorſe
          and madneſs of Oreſtes is touched in the
          fineſt manner. Theſe indeed are but ſketches,
          but they are the ſketches of a great maſter: a
          ſucceeding poet had the ſkill to give them
          
          
        <pb n="137"/>
       
        their finiſhing, and heightened them with
          the warmeſt glow of colouring. The ſpirit
          of Æſchylus ſhines through this tragedy; but
          a certain ſoftening of grief hangs over it, and
          gives it an air of ſolemn magnificence.
          </p><p>
          The ſcene of this tragedy, as of the former,
          is at Argos before the royal palace. Oreſtes,
          according to the cuſtom of ancient times, offering his hair on the tomb of his father, ſees
          a train of females advancing from the houſe,
          and bringing libations to the tomb; from
          whence the play receives its name. The action
          is afterwards removed to the area before the
          palace. This requires no change of ſcene.</p>

                <p>The Chorus, as more experienced through their age, had inſtructed Electra how to addreſs the ſhade of her father, to pour her firſt vows for bleſſings on herſelf and her friends, and particularly to remember Oreſtes. As he was dearest to her heart, ſhe ſoon forgets herſelf; and her warmest vows are for his happy return ; then, recurring to what particularly concerns herſelf, ſhe prays, not for a reſtoration to her princely rank, but for the virtues becoming her sex, that ſhe may be much more modest than her mother, and her hand more holy. Propriety of character is one of the great excellencies of Æschylus, of which this is a very delicate inſtance.</p>

                <p>The Chorus begins this Pæan to the dead with lamentations for their loft lord ; they are proceeding to invoke his aid ; but this is ſcarce mentioned, when they break off with outcries, the prophetic rapture ſeizes them, and impreſſes on the imagination the youthful hero in all his radiant arms coming to avenge the death of his father. This is the sublime and daring ſpirit which diſtinguiſhes Æschylus from all other writers. It makes one bluſh to point out this to the reader ; but Mr. Heath has rendered it neceſſary, who, by underſtanding this optative not interrogative (as he expreſſes himself), hath annihilated the beauty and grandeur of the image.</p>

                <p>Much good wit hath been thrown away upon this paſſage, which might well have been ſpared, had the deſign of the poet been attended to. No diſcovery is from hence raiſed ; but the mind of Electra is deeply ſtruck; ſhe reasons, and conjectures, and ſo is finely prepared for the diſcovery which ſoon follows. Aristotle has mentioned this, but in his dryeſt manner; yet it is plain, that he underſtood it thus, for he has drawn up the reasoning of Electra into a syllogism in form. But envy and buffoonery are perverse qualities.</p>

                <p>The ladies, in the simplicity of ancient times, valued themſelves much, and indeed were highly esteemed for their skill in embroidery : these rich wrought veſts made great part of the wealth of noble houſes: Andromache, Helen, and Penelope were celebrated for their fine work, of which Minerva herſelf was the patroness ; and Dido was as excellent as the beſt of them. As they could not but know what their own hands had wrought, nothing could bring them clearer conviction than a sight of their own curious labours. Oreſtes was nearly arrived to manhood, when he left, or was driven from Argos ; it must therefore be extreme malice, or rival jealousy, which could give this paſſage so ridiculous a turn as to ſuppoſe, that Orestes now wore a veſt made for him in his infancy ; beſides, the word ὕφασμα, as Stanley candidly obſerves, is a general term ; and the reader is left at his liberty to underſtand by it a belt, or any other piece of embroidery : certainly it was not the vestment of Orestes, for he returned in the habit of a peasant ; and it concerned him greatly, that no part of his dreſs ſhould discover him to Clytemnestra.</p>

                <p>Mr. Heath, who hath given us a ſpecimen of his critical acumen on the former part of this ſpeech, obſerves here, that Oreſtes cannot be ſuppoſed to reckon his own penury among the cauſes that incite him to revenge his father's death ; but his princely generofity was affected at the poverty of those illustrious conquerors who had overturned Troy. It must indeed have hurt his generous mind to ſee ſuch men enslaved by a woman, and an effeminate man ; this the poet with great judgment observes , but he no where ſays that their new tyrants had touched the soldiers spoils : he makes Ægisthus ſay, that he was master of Agamemnon's treasures ; and Electra, in her firſt addreſs to her father's ſhade, with much indignation ſays to him,

            And indeed it might be ſome aggravation to the misfortunes
even of a brave prince, to see the ſhameless ufurpers of his poſſeſſions waſting his wealth in riot, whilft he was compelled to
feek a miferable and precarious ſubſiſtence from the charity of
others.

                <p>Mr. Heath acutely obſerves, that the true ſenſe of this paſſage hath eſcaped the ſagacity of all the interpreters , who have been led into their error by uniformly taking it as referring to the murder of Agamemnon ; whereas, in truth, it relates ſolely to poor Electra, whoſe ears had been ſoundly boxed by her mother ; and the words are to be rendered thus, <quote>She ſtruck a martial ſtroke (meaning the firſt box on the ear she gave her daughter, as the ſignal of battle), then might you ſee many cuffs often repeated, her hand twisted in my hair, after the manner of a Cissian female warrior.</quote>  Spirit of Pauw, be this an atonement for all the inſults heaped upon thee!</p>
                <p>The deſign of Electra here is to excite her brother to avenge the murder of their father ; and we ſhall perceive, that this is finely carried on. Upon the accidental mention of "fairer fortune," ſhe ſays, how ſhall we obtain it ? by ſpeaking our griefs aloud, or by flattering our mother ? but they admit no ſoftening, nor can we ever think of her with any degree of tenderness: she ſtruck the bloody ſtroke, ſhe repeated it on his unhappy head with all the fierceness of a Cissian Virago ; then ſhe buried him without his honours. Oreſtes anſwers preciſely to this, that vengeance, by the aſſiſtance of the Gods, and by his hand, would inflict puniſhment for this wrong done to his father : but as he ſhows himſelf affected at the revenge to be executed, Electra proceeds to give him an account of the indignities offered to the dead body.</p>

All the men of Lemnos that were able to bear arms, had invaded Thrace, and continued the war three years. their wives, ſtung with rage and jealouſy, formed an horrid deſign, which they executed the very night on which their husbands returned, to murder every male on the iſland.

                <p>Electra's affection for her brother induces her to attend Clytemneſtra. on hearing the feigned account of his death, ſhe breaks into a formal exclamation on the curſe of Thyeſtes, proper enough as ſhe was circumſtanced; but what nature would not have dictated had her grief been real: ſhe cautiously avoids aſking the ſtrangers any question, and even leads the queen from making inquiries, by expreſſing a fondneſs for her brother, and throwing out a ſevere reflection, which ſhe had reason to think would give great offence, and ſo ſhorten the conversation.</p>

                <p>Oreſtes had enjoined the Chorus to be silent where they ought, and to ſpeak where their voice might aid him. they had kept themselves near the tomb till they saw him enter the palace; they then advance with an intention of aſſiſting his cause, as occasions ſhould arise: Giliſſa ſoon gave them a very favourable one, which they readily embrace, by conjuring that faithful ſervant to call forth Ægisthus alone without his guards, which facilitated the enterpriſe of Oreſtes; to induce her to this, they were obliged to give her hopes of some favourable event; but though they knew her fidelity, they could not be enough aſſured of her prudence to trust her with the important ſecret: had they told her that the person, who appeared under the character of a meſſenger, had brought tidings that would give her joy, they had discovered too much; they prudently therefore refer her to the power of Jupiter, who might redreſs these evils: How? replies the nurse; Oreſtes, our hope, is dead: the answer of the Chorus is so ambiguous, that she could not possibly comprehend it in its full meaning, yet clear enough to induce her to ask whether they had heard any thing that contradicted the report: not to anſwer this plain question in the negative, was to leave her mind under the impreſſion of hope, and with this she is ordered to carry her message, and leave the event to the Gods: this required some management, and it is finely conducted.

        <p>IT is pleaſant enough to obſerve with what

            tota ſcenæ facies mutatur, et pro Delphis ac

        <head>THE FURIES.</head>
        <p><figure id="page_num_220">220</figure>The poet, it ſeems, had dared to violate the
          unities; and further has introduced perſonages of ſo extravagant a character as to
          baffle the ſkill of theſe literary martinets, and
          to whip them from their ſoining fence; <emph>hinc
            illæ lachrymæ</emph>. Æſchylus in all his other
          pieces that remain to us, has paid the ſtricteſt
          attention to theſe favourite unities; and
          with reaſon; he was their father, and knew
          their merit as well as any man: Even here,
          where his management of the ſubject led
          him to treat them with leſs reſpect, he has
          ſoftened the violation by a kind of magic
          power: Apollo and the Furies muſt be allowed the liberty to tranſport themſelves whither
          and when they pleaſe; and Mercury has the
          charge of conducting Oreſtes; ſo that had
          Horace wrote,
          <quote xml:lang="lat">Ille per extentum Funem mihi poſſe videtur
            Ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,
            Inritat,

        <p>The alluſion would have added a wonderful
          propriety to the expreſſion, and the lines
          have conveyed a juſt character of this tragedy.
          However a French or a Dutch critic may be
          ſlocked at this change of ſcene, to an Athenian nothing could be more agreeable than to
          ſee a conteſt, which Apollo could not compoſe at Delphos, brought before the great
          council of his own city, the God in perſon
          attending and pleading in the cauſe. That
          reſpect to his country, which diſtinguiſhes
          our noble poet above all the writers of antiquity, has an irreſiſtible charm. "<quote>Rules,
            art, decorum, all fall before it. It goes
            directly to the heart, and gains all purpoſes at once.</quote>" The Engliſh reader feels
          this in its full force, and Æſchylus is acquitted of the charge of having violated
          an</p>
        <pb n="222"/>
        <head>THE FURIES.</head>
        <p><figure id="page_num_222">222</figure>an unity. As theſe dreadful ſiſters were
          the miniſters of the offended Gods, to execute
          their vengeance on impious mortals ſtained
          with blood, juſt, impartial, and of reſiſtleſs
          power, they were held in the higheſt reverence: as they were cruel, implacable, and
          delighted with their terrible office, they
          were deteſted, and abhorred by Gods and
          men: this accounts for the very different
          treatment they here meet with. For the
          reſt, let P. Brumoy be the poet's advocate.
          <quote>" On ſent aſſez que les traits rude et un
            peu groſſiers de cette piéce ſont fort oppoſés à notre goût, et au vray goût du
            théâtre. Mais il ne faut pas confondre
            parmi ces traits, ce qui regarde uniquement les mœurs et les idées des Grecs.
            Le ronſlement des Furies, et ce ſpectacle
            des monſtres difformes, ne vaut du tout
            rien. Cependant, comme c'etoient des

        </p>
        <p>Had theſe critics explained the motives,
          which induced this venerable court to acquit Oreſtes, from the laws and uſages of
          ancient times, they would have been better
          employed: but not a word of this. This
          curious enquiry was reſerved for a writer of a very different genius; and the
          reader will thank me for referring him
          to the notes on the Epiſtle to the Piſos,
          V. 127.

          amounted to fifty: the conſternation ariſing
          from their hideous figures, and geſtures,
          and yellings, had ſuch fatal effects upon
          the children <emph>et les femmes enceintes</emph>, that
          the ſtate by an expreſs law reduced the number of the Chorus to fifteen, and afterwards
          to twelve. But the tranſlator dares aſſure
          the Engliſh ladies, for whom he has too
          great a reſpect to offer them any thing
          that can have the leaſt tendency to hurt
          them, that they may read this play with
          the utmoſt ſafety. Theſe ancient virgins are, to be ſure, at firſt a little wayward, and rather outrageous; but they
          ſoften by degrees, till they become perfectly good-humoured, and the beſt company

                <p>The cuſtom of making preſents at the birth of a child is of high antiquity: a paſſage from the <hi>Phormio</hi> of Terence is alleged to prove, that the eighth day after the birth, on which the name was given, was eſteemed the <hi>dies natalis</hi>, and that the preſents were then offered; but that paſſage clearly proves, that these gifts were preſented on each day,

                        At the birth only ſome female relations attended as aſſiſtants to Lucina, and these came not empty-handed; on the other, the parents entertained their friends at a feaſt, the <hi>sacra repotia patrum</hi>, and the guests were liberal in their preſents to the mother: in this ſenſe probably we are to underſtand Homer, who ſays, that Delos upon the birth of Apollo was loaded with gold, <cit><quote xml:lang="grc"><l>χρυσοῦ, δ᾽ ἄρα Δῆλος ἅπασα</l>

                            By the ſons of Vulcan the Scholiaſt underſtands the Athenians, and tells us, that Theseus cleared the way of robbers: for which he is juſtly reproved by Pauw; for how came the Athenians to be ſons of Vulcan? he then recommends it to us to look in ſome dark corner, if haply ſomething may there lie hid which may give light to this paſſage. Apollo found the country around Parnaffus rocky and barren,

                                To cultivate this country, and to introduce the arts of poliſhed life, was a work worthy of Apollo, and we find that it was foon done: as Vulcan was the God of fire, "which lends its aid to every art," the workmen in the finer arts may properly be called his ſons.

    Hence their various rites of purifications, their oblations and ſacrifices. Under this idea the prieſteſs of Delphos is shocked at ſeeing in the temple a man abhorred by the Gods, becauſe his hands are ſtained with blood; and the Furies thus inſult Apollo,

<quote>

    </quote>
    Minerva is here apprehenſive of this pollution to her temple; this indeed is but hinted, and that with much tenderneſs, by the bare mention of Ixion. The famous Alexander Roſs tells us, that "Ixion was the ſon of Plegias, who having murder- ed his father-in-law, went up and down the earth as a vaga- bond, at laſt Jupiter did pity him, and expiating his crime, re- ceived him into Heaven." The concern of Oreſtes to remove this ſuggeſtion ſhows, that he clearly understood the Goddeſs; and her anſwer expreſſes her ſatisfaction as to this point.</p></note>

<note xml:id="note.281.f">Admetus, the ſon of Pheres, aſked Alceſtis in marriage; her father conſented on this hard condition, that he ſhould yoke a lion and a boar to his chariot: he addreſſed his vows to Apollo and Hercules, and by their aid rendered the ſavages gentle. Some time after, Admetus being dangerouſly ill, again addreſſed his vows to Apollo; the God refuſed his ſalu- tary aid, but upon condition, that one of his near relations would devote himſelf to a voluntary death for him: this Al- ceſtis did: Hercules, being then on his expedition to bring Cerberus from hell, brought back Alceſtis to her husband.- FULGENTIUS.-Whether the poet alludes to this ſtory, or to ſome other with which we are not acquainted, the learned reader will judge.</note>

            No repreſentation can be conceived more
            agreeable to a brave and free people,
            than that which ſets before their eyes the
            ruin of an invading tyrant defeated by their
            own valour; and no poet could ever claim
            the right of making ſuch repreſentation
            with ſo good a grace as Æſchylus, who
            had borne a diſtinguiſhed part in the real
          
            
         <pb n="306"/>
       
            ſcene. Animated by his noble ſubject,
            and the enthuſiaſm with which he loved
            his country, he has here diſplayed all the
            warmth and dignity of his genius, but tempered at the ſame time with ſo chaſtiſed
            a judgment, that we are ſurpriſed to ſee
            the infant drama come forth at once with
            all thoſe graces which conſtitute its perfection; it is like his own Minerva, that ſprung
            from the head of Jupiter
            <q>Then ſhining heav'nly fair, a Goddeſs arm'd.</q>
            Beſides this wonderful management of the
            parts, the poet has the delicacy to ſet the
            glory of his countrymen in the brighteſt
            view, by putting their praiſes into the
            mouths of their enemies. Not ſatisfied with
            a ſpirited narration of their defeat, and a
            recital
         </p>
         <pb n="307"/>
         <p>
            of the many royal chiefs that periſhed
            in that battle; not ſatisfied with ſpreading
            the terror through all the realms of
            Perſia, and placing them in a manner before our eyes in all the diſtreſs of deſolation and deſpair, he hath intereſted even
            the dead, and, with the aweful ſolemnity
            of a religious incantation, evoked the ghoſt
            of Darius to teſtify to his Perſians that no
            ſafety, no hope remained to them, if they
            continued their hoſtile attempts againſt
            Greece; ſo that his ſublime conception hath
            engaged Earth and Sea, Heaven and Hell,
            to bear honourable teſtimony to the glory
            of his countrymen, and the ſuperiority of
            their arms.

         <p>
            This tragedy was exhibited eight years
            after the defeat at Salamis, whilſt the memory
            of each circumſtance was yet recent;
            ſo that we may conſider the narration as
            a faithful hiſtory of this great event. The
            war was not yet ended, though the Perſian
            monarch had offered to make the moſt humiliating conceſſions, and the Athenians
            were inclined to accept them; but Themiſtocles oppoſed the peace. So that we
            are further to conſider this play in a political light; the poet, by ſo animated a
            deſcription of the pernicious effects of an
            obſtinate pride, and by filling the ſpectators with a malignant compaſſion for the
            vaniſhed Xerxes, indirectly undiſpoſing
            his countrymen to a continuation of the
            war. Thus every thing at Athens, even
            their ſhows, had a reſpect to the public
            good. This is the fine remark of P. Brumoy.

            The ſcene of this tragedy is at Suſa, before the ancient ſtructure appropriated to

            of Darius.

<note xml:id="note.311.a">Darius, king of Persia, having demanded the daughter of Jancyrus, king of the European Scythians, in marriage, and not obtaining the lady, was so highly offended, that he marched with a great army to revenge the affront; but ſucceeding ill againſt the Scythians, on his return he ſent Datis and Artaphernes with an army of two hundred thousand foot, and ten thouſand horſe, to ſubdue Greece; they had advanced within ten miles of Athens, which had particularly diſpleaſed the Great King, when Miltiades, at the head of nine thouſand Athenians, and one thouſand Platæans, met them in the plains of Marathon, and gave them battle. Datis drew one hundred thouſand foot, and all his horſe into the field; but the Persians were totally defeated, and fled to their ſhips with great precipitation. To revenge this disgrace Xerxes, the son of Darius, invaded Greece in person, with one thousand two hundred ſhips of war, and two thouſand transports; his land-forces conſiſting of ſeven hundred thouſand foot, and four hundred thousand horse: these, with the retinue of women and ſervants, that attended the Asiatic princes in their military expeditions, amounted to more than five millions. Xerxes, having forced the paſs of Thermopylæ, marched into Attica, which he wasted, and finding Athens deſerted, ſet it on fire. The Grecians had retired with all their effects to Troezene and Salamis; here Themistocles with three hundred ſhips deſtroyed the Persian fleet; their ſupplies of proviſion be- ing hereby cut off, the land-forces attempted to make their retreat through Bœotia and Thessaly to Thrace, but most of them periſhed by the ſword, famine, and pestilence. The battle of Platæa cut off the remains of this formidable armament, and ſecured the liberty of Greece. Such is the noble ſubject of this tragedy. For this account we have the teſti- monies of Herodotus, Iſocrates, Diodorus the Sicilian, Plutarch, Cicero, Juſtin, Nepos, and others; yet a late ingenious writer has undertaken, from the silence of the Persian his- tory, to disprove them all: " can any man, who has made the leaſt obſervation on hiſtory, he aſks, ſuppoſe for a moment that ſuch myriads could by any means have been maintained in one collected body ?"-History tells us, that they periſhed chiefly through famine, and its attendant the peſtilence. He ſays, " the destruction of ſuch a number would have convulſed the whole of Aſia had it been united under one empire: could it poſſibly have been unfelt in Perfia?" - Was it not ſeverely felt? He thinks, that " the States of Greece appear in reality, with regard to the Persians, to have been too far re- moved from that degree of importance, which could hold them up as objects of ſuch high ambition, or of ſuch mighty reſentment. Theſe famous invaſions have, therefore, an ap- pearance of being ſimply the movements of the governors of Aſia Minor, to regulate or enforce a tribute which the Greeks might frequently be willing to neglect. Marathon, Salamis, and other celebrated battles, may indeed have been real events; and the Grecian writers, to dignify their country, may have turned hyperbole into hiſtoric fact, and ſwelled the thousands of the Persian Satrap into the millions of the Persian King."-RICHARDSON'S DISSERTATION.-But this difre- gard to the evidence of Grecian antiquity, is only to prepare us for the reception of his Persian Antiquity: yet could this very senſible writer ſee and lament in other cases, that "attachment to ſyſtem has heaped error upon error, and raiſed ſpendid fabrics upon pillars of ice," Nor</note>

'That Atoſsa feared a revolt in the ſtate, appears by her in- treating the Chorus, the great council of Persia, to comfort her son at his return, and attend him to his house, Μὴ καὶ τι πρὸς κακῶισι πρόσθηται κακὸν ; and by declaring, that she will not forsake in their afflictions those whom the holds most dear,

    Though her particular anxiety was for her son: thus the meſ- ſenger understands her; and, having aſſured her of the ſafety of Xerxes, proceeds without further queſtion to inform her what ſceptred chiefs had periſhed. Mr. Heath destroys this propriety, and the whole sense of the context, by, the idea which he has affixed to the words ἄνανδρον τάξιν, and for which he has no warrant from Æschylus: would he carry the ſame idea to the ἔυνιδας ἀνάνδρες of v. 289?</note>

Nepos tells us from Herodotus, that the commanders of the Grecian fleet, terrified with the destruction of Athens, agreed to return home to defend their own ſtates: this must have been a ruinous measure, as, had they ſeparated, they would have been easily crushed. Themistocles alone opposed it; but his remonstrance had little weight with Eurybiades, the king of Sparta, who then commanded in chief: he therefore formed this plan, that they might all be obliged to fight, however contrary to their judgment it ſucceeded. Thus Xerxes, ſays the historian, was conquered by the measures of Themistocles, rather than by the arms of Greece.</note>

Hyde, a zealous advocate for the orthodoxy of  Magiſm, cries out, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Bone deus, quanta ſunt hæc mendacia !</foreign>  The fact, however, is inconteſtable; and whether the adoration was religious or civil, real or emblematical, was of no  concern to the Athenian poet, though of much to the Chriftian divine. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ipſe viderit.</foreign> </note>

to the winds. Xerxes retained enough of this purer Sabaiſm,
to demoliſh all the temples of Greece in his march; though
Hyde, in commenting on this narration of Herodotus, in-
forms us, that Perſia at that time abounded with temples;
hence Xerxes, amidst his devaſtations, conſiſtently enough
with the principles and practice of his country, ſpared the
temple of Apollo at Delos, and the temple of Diana at Ephefus, confidering the one as confecrated to the Sun, the other

    <p>
And now, pour donner le congé à ces remarques, the tranflator thinks it neceſſary to declare, that living altogether in a
private and retired ſtation, he had not, during his engagement
in this work, the opportunity of confulting any learned
friend on any dificulty, and difficulties enough occurred;
neither did he know, till after the tranflation was publiſhed,
that there were any annotations on Æschylus, except what
Pauw has given with Stanley's edition: therefore whatever miſtakes or inaccuracies may have eſcaped him, they are to be
attributed intirely to his own want of judgment. In reading
Pauw he could obſerve, that he ſometimes fuffered himself to
be hurried into errors; and he lamented, that ſo able a critic
would not allow himself time to reviſe what he had written:
this he ascribed to a certain impetuofity of temper, which
ſeems natural to him; he alſo diſapproves his rude and offenfive bluntneſs, and wished that he had learned to facrifice to
the Graces; but he saw in this ſaucy man much erudition, a
bold genius, and a strong conception of his author's meaning,
which enabled him to elucidate ſome paſſages, which were
before involved in tenfold darkness: no wonder therefore,
that he gratefully acknowledged his obligations to him. But
he foon found, that he had taken an unpopular part; the
tranflation was ſcarcely publiſhed, when he was taught to
know, that his honourable mention of Pauw had given offence;
he was ſurpriſed and hurt at this, but was quickly informed,
that M. D'Orville had made a collection of Pauw's crudities,
and publiſhed them purpoſely to expoſe the man. Shortly after this, a learned friend ſent him Mr. Heath's notes: this
gentleman was fo highly offended at Pauw's " wanton inſolence and contumelious arrogance," that he sees nothing in
him but " the groſſeft ignorance, and a perpetual alacrity in
blundering;" and if at any time he is compelled to acknowledge the juſtneſs of a remark, he accounts for it as for the
blind man's ſhooting the crow; he therefore profeſſedly writes
againft Pauw: this has carried him too frequently into an afperity of ſtyle, more indecent than that which had excited his indignation;
nation; befides that horrid ſneer, which is like the American
mode of tarring and feathering a man that has been ſo un-
happy as to offend them: this is the more to be lamented, as
in every other reſpect Mr. Heath ſeems to have been a man of
a very candid and amiable diſpoſition. But this is not the
worſt; his perpetual propensity to reprobate Pauw, has fome-
times mifled him to obſervations very unworthy of him as a
ſcholar and a critic. In this cafe, what could the tranflator do?
His nature is moſt averſe to difputation; but theſe annotators
pull violently different ways, the tranſlation was between
them, and was given to the public before he had ſeen the
learned obſervations of the latter; he has done what he is perfuaded a fair and honest man ought to do; he has carefully reviſed the tranflation; where he is convinced that he was miſtaken, he has acknowledged and corrected the mistake; whereever in a diſputed paſſage he thinks he has reaſon to adhere to
his former interpretation, he fairly gives his reason; the
learned reader will judge: Mr. Heath's great and deſerved reputation made this in a manner neceſſary for his own vindication; but he hopes, that he has not ſuffered any aſperity to
mingle with his diſſent, as he would be the firſt to be ashamed
of having violated that candour and good manners which are
due from one gentleman to another.</p>
