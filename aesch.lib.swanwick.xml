            <note n="109.1">* The story of Meleager, as related by Phoenix to Achilles (Il. ix. 529), is fundamentally opposed to that of the later poets. In Homer nothing is heard of the fatal brand. Meleager had, in some unfortunate fray, killed his mother's brother; upon which his mother solemnly cursed him, and prayed to Pluto and Persephone for his death. At this he was so indignant (or so paralysed for battle by believing in the curse), that he refused to defend his native city, Calydon, at a critical moment, and was only at last prevailed on by his wife to take arms and save it. Here the story ends in Homer; though he says that the Fury who stalks in darkness heard the mother's curse. According to the later poets, Meleager had slain seven brothers of his mother. At his birth she had been informed by the Fates that he would live until a certain log of wood then burning on the hearth was consumed. On this she snatched it off, extinguished it, and kept it carefully in a chest. But now, in rage for the loss of so many brothers, she threw it into the fire, and forthwith her son perished.</note>
            <note n="110.1">* Nisos, king of Megara, is said to have had on his head a certain purple lock, upon which, according to the words of an oracle, his life depended. Scylla, his daughter, knew it, and bribed by a golden necklace, the gift of Minos, king of Crete, she cut the fatal lock, and thus caused her father's death.</note>
            <note n="111.1">* Herodotus, after relating how the Lemnian women had been put to death by their husbands, adds, " From this crime, and that which the women perpetrated before this, who, with the assistance of Thoas, killed their own husbands, all cruel actions are wont to be called Lemnian throughout Greece.”— (vi. 138.)</note>

          <p>56. For <quote xml:lang="grc">μένει χρονίζοντ᾽ ἄχη βρύει</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">μένει χρονίζοντας ἄχη</quote>, omitting <quote xml:lang="grc">βρύει</quote>.</p>
          <p>61. For <quote xml:lang="grc">παναρκέτας νόσου βρύειν</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">παγκαρτέρας νούσου βρύειν</quote>.</p>
          <p>65. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐκ μίας ὁδοῦ</quote> I conjecture <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐκ [τρικυ]μίας ὁμοῦ</quote>; also omit the prosaic <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸν</quote> before <quote xml:lang="grc">χερομυσῆ</quote>.</p>
          <p>67. For <quote xml:lang="grc">καθαίροντες ἰοῦσαν ἄτην</quote>, perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">καθαίροντες [καθαίρ] ουσιν μάτην</quote>.</p>
          <p>68-72 and 73-77 to be also antistrophic; but here dwell only on the changes important to a translator.</p>
          <p>In 73, for <quote xml:lang="grc">βίαι φερομένων</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">βίαια φυρωμένων</quote>, and in 71, 72 read— [<quote xml:lang="grc">δεῖ</quote>] <quote xml:lang="grc">δίκαια, μὴ δίκαια</quote>, [<quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ</quote>] <quote xml:lang="grc">πρέποντα</quote> and for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαῖς βίου</quote>, which is unintelligible, the least correction is <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαῖσί μου</quote>; yet I suspect that the poet wrote <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀκριβέσι</quote>, "exact in virtue."</p>
          <p>145-156. Read <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπότρεπον</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπότροπον</quote>, governing accus. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄχος</quote>, and join <quote xml:lang="grc">κεδνῶν</quote> with <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπότρεπον</quote>. Then <quote xml:lang="grc">τ'</quote> after <quote xml:lang="grc">κεδνῶν</quote> must be omitted or changed to <quote xml:lang="grc">γ'</quote>. In v. 150 <quote xml:lang="grc">σεβασω</quote> is clearly corrupt. We need a tribrach, beginning with two consonants, to support the <quote xml:lang="grc">ε</quote> of <quote xml:lang="grc">κλύε</quote>. I conjecture <quote xml:lang="grc">σκεπανὰ</quote>, “ things covered.” Besides, <quote xml:lang="grc">καναχές</quote>, " tinkling as metal,” is an improbable epithet of a tear. The line has no metre. Aldus edited <quote xml:lang="grc">κἀναχες</quote>, which suggests to me <quote xml:lang="grc">κἀναχεῖτ'</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">Ὀλόμενον</quote>
          </p>
          <pb n="134"/>
          <p>is also an unpleasant epithet, especially as joined with <quote xml:lang="grc">ὀλομένῳ δεσπότα</quote>. I incline to put <quote xml:lang="grc">ὀλόμενον</quote> in brackets.</p>
          <p>155. <quote xml:lang="grc">"Αρης</quote> in that position cannot be right. I think it should be <quote xml:lang="grc">μάχης</quote>. A verb is deficient. One may think of <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπιπάλλοι μάχης</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπιπάλλων ἄρης</quote>. In that case <quote xml:lang="grc">ἂν</quote> may well be supplied before <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀναλυτήρ</quote>, since <quote xml:lang="grc">τίς ἂν</quote> with the optative expresses “Oh that!” I further think that <quote xml:lang="grc">χεροῖν παλίντονα ἐν</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">κεροῖν παλιντόνοιν</quote>, since bows and not arrows are <quote xml:lang="grc">παλίντονα</quote>. Perhaps the piece is antistrophic, and some further errors may thus be discerned.</p>
          <p>271. <quote xml:lang="grc">τάσδε νῶν</quote>.— By all means adopt Hermann's <quote xml:lang="grc">τάσδ' αἰνῶν</quote>.</p>
          <p>361. The word <quote xml:lang="grc">ὤφελον</quote> is essential. We may read <quote xml:lang="grc">πάρος δ' [ὠφελόν γ'] οἱ κτανόντες νιν οὕτω δαμῆναι</quote>. if in the strophe, 343, we read <quote xml:lang="grc">τέκνων τ᾽ ἂν κελεύθοις ἐπίστρεπτον ἀιῶ κομίσσας</quote>. v.e., <quote xml:lang="grc">τ' ἂν</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">re</quote>, and <quote xml:lang="grc">κομίσσας</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">κτίσσας</quote>, which make good metre.</p>
          <p>366. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ὀδυνασαι</quote> I think <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ δύνασαι</quote> is far better than <quote xml:lang="grc">δύνασαι</quote>.</p>
          <p>613. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀκαίρως δὲ</quote> I suggest <quote xml:lang="grc">Ἀχαιοίς γε</quote>, as expressing at least the right syntax and general sense. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπεύχετον</quote> by all means read <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπευκτέον</quote> with Blomfield. Next, for <quote xml:lang="grc">σέβας τιων δὲ</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">σεβαστέον δὲ</quote>, and the sentence as a whole will be clear. Only <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπικότῳ</quote> remains corrupt. The emphasis of Clytemnestra's guilt will be marked by <quote xml:lang="grc">δῄοις ὑπερκότῳ</quote>, triumphant over the foe;” as in Agam. 795, <quote xml:lang="grc">ὑπερκότους</quote>, "triumphant, successful." (Whether the true spelling be <quote xml:lang="grc">ὑπέρκοπος</quote> does not here concern us.)</p>
          <p>633. A verb is lost, to which <quote xml:lang="grc">παρεκβάντες</quote> is nominative, For <quote xml:lang="grc">γὰρ οὐ λὰξ</quote> perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">γὰρ [ὤλεσαν] λὰξ</quote>: <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ</quote> makes sheer nonsense. <quote xml:lang="grc">Πατρὸς</quote> is also deficient in the antistrophe. For <quote xml:lang="grc">† διμασε αἱμάτων</quote> perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">δόμοισι [τοῖς πατρὸς, χ]</quote>, <quote xml:lang="grc">αἱμάτων</quote>, which will fulfil the metrical conditions.</p>
          <p>715. <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸν Νύχιον</quote> is not explicable. I think some one has well suggested <quote xml:lang="grc">τὰν Νυχίαν</quote>, “ the Fury, Child of Night,” Eumen. 311.</p>
          <p>773, 774. Read—<quote xml:lang="grc">δὸς τύχας πλεῖν δόμοις κυρίως, πανσόφῳ σθένει μαιομένα σ' ἰδεῖν διαδικάσαι</quote>.</p>
          <p>783. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐν δρόμῳ προστιθεὶς</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">κἀν δρόμῳ προστιθείης</quote>.</p>
          <p>784, 785. Read (as a first approximation)— <quote xml:lang="grc">δὸς οὖν σωζομένου ῥυθμοῦ ποτε διαθεῖν ἔμπεδον ἀνόμενων βημάτων ὄρεγμα</quote>.</p>
          <pb n="135"/>
          <p>788. By all means retain <quote xml:lang="grc">νομίζετε</quote>.</p>
          <p>791. I think <quote xml:lang="grc">λύσασθ'</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">λύσαιθ'</quote>, addressed to the gods.</p>
          <p>793. For <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ δὲ καλῶς κτάμενον</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">τοῦδε καλῶς κταμένου</quote>, or <quote xml:lang="grc">τοῖνδε καλῶς κταμένοιν</quote>, and so end the third strophe.</p>
          <p>794. <quote xml:lang="grc">εὖ δὸς ἂν ἰδεῖν</quote> is certainly corrupt, especially as <quote xml:lang="grc">ἰδεῖν</quote> is in the next line. <quote xml:lang="grc">Σὺ δ᾽ ἀμφιεπεῖν</quote> . . . is possible, or <quote xml:lang="grc">σὺ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἀμφιεπεῖν</quote>. After <quote xml:lang="grc">λαμπρῶς</quote> perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">δὸς</quote> is wanting.</p>
          <p>799. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπιφορώτατος</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁ φωριώτατος</quote>.</p>
          <p>801. For <quote xml:lang="grc">κρύπτ᾽ ἄσκοπον δ'</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">κρύφα μὲν, εὔσκοπον δ'</quote>.</p>
          <p>802. For <quote xml:lang="grc">νύκτα πρό τ',</quote> . . read <quote xml:lang="grc">νύκτωρ πρὀυμμάτων</quote>.</p>
          <p>803. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐμφανέστερος</quote> read with Schutz <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐμφανέστερον</quote>. In place of <quote xml:lang="grc">πολλὰ δ᾽ ἄλλα φανεῖ χρήζων</quote>, which comes out of place after 800, I think we should have, to close antistrophe 3, <quote xml:lang="grc">πολλά τε δῆλα φανεῖ</quote>. The superfluous <quote xml:lang="grc">χρήζων</quote> rises out of the error that Apollo, not Mercury, is intended.</p>
          <p>805. For <quote xml:lang="grc">τοτε δὴ</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">τότ' ᾠδὰν</quote>, <quote xml:lang="grc">κλυτὸν</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">πλοῦτον</quote>, <quote xml:lang="grc">λύτρον</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">λυτήριον</quote>, and leave <quote xml:lang="grc">σχέθων</quote> in 817 unchanged.</p>
          <p>811. Read <quote xml:lang="grc">μεθήσομεν πόλει. τὸ δ' εὔνομον ἐμοὶ κέρδος αὔξεται</quote>, τοι <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ δ' εὖ ἐμὸν ἐμὸν κέρδος ἀέξεται</quote>.</p>
          <p>815. <quote xml:lang="grc">περαίνων</quote>. Adopt Blomfield's <quote xml:lang="grc">πέραιν' οὐκ</quote>.</p>
          <p>820. For <quote xml:lang="grc">προπράσσων χάριτος ὀργὰς λυπρὸς</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">πρόπραξον χάριν σφαγᾶς λυτῆρος</quote>, as at least something possible.</p>
          <p>823. <quote xml:lang="grc">φοινίαν</quote>, read <quote xml:lang="grc">φόνιον</quote>.</p>
          <p>824. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐξαπολλὺς μόρου</quote> cannot be right. Perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐξαπόλλυ ἐν μέρει</quote>, “ in turn, in retaliation.”</p>
          <pb n="136"/>
          <p>849. After <quote xml:lang="grc">πολισσονόμους</quote> add with Hermann [<quote xml:lang="grc">πλοῦτόν τε δόμων</quote>].</p>
          <p>935. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔθιγε δὲ μάλα</quote>, or <quote xml:lang="grc">δὲ μάχα</quote>, we need <quote xml:lang="grc">δὲ ξίφους</quote>. The scholiast has <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐφήψατο τοῦ ξίφους</quote>.</p>
          <p>940—947. This third strophe is terribly corrupt. For <quote xml:lang="grc">τάνπερ</quote> I propose <quote xml:lang="grc">τάδ' ἄρα</quote>; in <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐποχθείαξεν</quote> I see <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπαξιῶν, τὰν</quote> <quote xml:lang="grc">έ</quote> being written <quote xml:lang="grc">χο</quote> in very old style. <quote xml:lang="grc">Τὰν</quote> is essential with <quote xml:lang="grc">δολίαν</quote>. For <quote xml:lang="grc">βλαπτομέναν</quote> I propose <quote xml:lang="grc">βλαψίπουν</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="lat">pede l'œna claudo</foreign>); I leave <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐν χρόνοις</quote> as it is, but for <quote xml:lang="grc">θεῖσαν ἐποίχεται</quote> I conjecture <quote xml:lang="grc">οἷσι μετοίχεται</quote>, " fetches in his own tines.” Then 944, <quote xml:lang="grc">κρατεῖται πως</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">κρατεῖ τοι λόγος</quote>, or <quote xml:lang="grc">φάτις</quote> (see Pers., 724; Suppl., 290; Soph. Αj., 978). For <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ θεῖον παρὰ τὸ</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ, θεῖόν περ ὄντα</quote>, and add [<quote xml:lang="grc">Δία</quote>] after <quote xml:lang="grc">ὑπουργεῖν</quote>. Sense and metre are then perfect, except that we may read <quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ οὐκ</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ</quote> to remedy hiatus. <quote xml:lang="grc">Δὲ</quote> after <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄξιον</quote> must be retained.</p>
          <p>948. The second antistrophe begins <quote xml:lang="grc">μέγαν τ' ἀφηρέθην ψάλιον οἴκων ἄναγε μὰν δόμοις</quote>. I propose <quote xml:lang="grc">μέγαν ἀφηρέθην ἅλιον, οἰκίοις | ἀναφανέντ᾽ ἐμοῖς</quote> : the Sun being " prosperity from the prince's face.” Next, with Elmsley, <quote xml:lang="grc">χαμαιπετὴς ἔκειτο</quote>. But a line is defcient. Perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ [καλυφθεὶς σκότῳ]</quote>, which completes sense and metre.</p>
          <p>952. For <quote xml:lang="grc">χρόνος ἀμείψεται</quote> perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">χρόνῳ σκέψεται</quote>, or <quote xml:lang="grc">χρόνοις σκέψεται</quote>. The verb should at least be a Cretic foot.</p>
          <p>954. For <quote xml:lang="grc">μύσος πᾶν ἐλάσῃ</quote> I would read <quote xml:lang="grc">μῦσος ἅπαν παραλύσῃ</quote>, for metrical reasons, and because of <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀτᾶν ἐλατηρίοις</quote> following.</p>
          <p>958. For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἰδεῖν ἀκοῦσαι θρεομένοις</quote>, perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">ἰδεῖν ἀκοῦσαί τ' ἐραμένοισιν</quote>.</p>
          <p>1058. <quote xml:lang="grc">μόχθοι τάλανές τε Θυέστου</quote> is clearly wrong. One cure is to omit <quote xml:lang="grc">τε Θυέστου</quote>, regarding <quote xml:lang="grc">Θυέστου</quote> to be an interpretation, and <quote xml:lang="grc">Te</quote> to have been inserted afterwards for the metre. If <quote xml:lang="grc">Θυέστου</quote> must be retained, we need something like <quote xml:lang="grc">πίνακές</quote> (the dishes) for <quote xml:lang="grc">τάλανές</quote>; or if <quote xml:lang="grc">τάλαρος</quote>, like <foreign xml:lang="lat">calathus</foreign> may mean a dish, <quote xml:lang="grc">τάλαροί</quote> will be as plausible.</p>
