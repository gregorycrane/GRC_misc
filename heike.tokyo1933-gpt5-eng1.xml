<s xml:id="sent1.1.1.5">Looking far back to **foreign lands**, **Zhao Gao of Qin**, **Wang Mang of Han**, **Zhou Yi of Liang**, and **Lushan of Tang**—these were all men who disregarded the government of their former masters and previous emperors, indulged in extreme pleasures, took no heed of warnings, failed to recognize that the realm would fall into disorder, and were ignorant of the people's suffering, and thus were soon overthrown and perished.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.1.1.6">Looking closely at **our own country**, the careers of **Masakado of Jōhei**, **Sumitomo of Tengyō**, **Yoshichika of Kōwa**, and **Nobuyori of Heiji** were all diverse in their arrogance and might, but the state of the man known as the **Priest of Rokuhara**, the **former Grand Minister of State**, **Taira no Ason Kiyomori**, is one about which the mind and tongue cannot convey what we have heard passed down.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.1.2.2">The Prince's son, **Prince Taka**, died **without office or rank**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.1.2.3">It was during the time of his son, **Prince Takamochi**, that he first received the **surname Taira** and was appointed **Vice Governor of Kazusa**, suddenly **leaving the imperial family** to **join the ranks of the subjects**.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.2">The **dedication ceremony** was on the **thirteenth day of the third month of Tenshō 1** (1131).</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.3">He was told that he would be **granted a vacant province as a reward**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.4">He was given the province of **Tajima**, which was **vacant** at the time.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.5">Out of **great admiration**, the **Retired Emperor** permitted him to **ascend to the Palace's inner apartments** (Shōden).</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.6">**Tadamori** was **thirty-six** when he first **gained admission to the Palace**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.7">The **courtiers** (Kumoi no Hito) **envied** this, and on the **night of the Festival of the Five Annual Ceremonies** (Gosechi Toyo no Akari no Sekchi), the **twenty-third day of the eleventh month of the same year**, they **planned to ambush and kill Tadamori**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.8">**Tadamori** heard of this and said, "**I am not a person of letters**, but was born into a **house of military valor**. To suffer such **unexpected disgrace** would be **unfortunate for my family and for myself**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.9">The maxim states: 'In performing an action, **preserve your body and serve your lord**.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.10">" Therefore, he **made preparations** beforehand.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.11">From the start of his entry to the Palace, he carried a **large, sheathed sword** (Sayamaki), wearing it **carelessly under his court attire** (Sokutai), and facing the **dim light of the fire**, he **softly drew this sword** and **held it to his temples**, whereupon it seemed to them like **ice**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.12">Everyone **strained their eyes** to see.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.13">Furthermore, one of Tadamori's retainers, **Iesada**, **Vice Lieutenant of the Left Gate Guards**, son of **Shin no Saburō Tayū Iefusa**, grandson of **Ki no Suke Tadamitsu** (who was formerly of the same family), was there.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.14">He wore a **light-blue court robe** (Hitōtori) over a **lime-green laced cuirass** (Moegi Odoshi no Haramaki), and with a **sheathed great sword** (Tachi) tucked at his side, he **sat humbly** in the **small courtyard of the Palace's inner apartments** (Tenjō no Koniwa).</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.15">The **Chief Courtier** (Kanshu) and others wondered, saying, "**Who is that person** in a **plain robe** (Hōi) sitting **inside the covered corridor** (Utsubo Bashira) and **near the bell cord** (Suzu no Tsuna no Hen)?</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.16">This is **disorderly**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.17">**Leave immediately**."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.18">When a **Sixth-Rank Official** told him this, **Iesada** replied, "**I heard that my hereditary lord, the Governor of Bizen, is to be ambushed tonight**, so I am **waiting here to see what happens**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.19">I **cannot possibly leave**."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.20">Since he **remained humbly seated**, they perhaps judged this to be **unwise**, and so the **ambush that night did not take place**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.21"></s></p>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.3">Although these people were, respectfully speaking, the descendants of **Emperor Kashiwabara**, they had been **estranged from the capital's residence** for a time, behaving only as **lower-ranking officials** (Jige) and living deeply rooted in **Ise Province**, so they were called the **Taira of Ise** (Ise Heishi), using the name of the province as a metaphor for their character.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.4">Moreover, since **Tadamori** was **cross-eyed**, they **ridiculed** him in this manner.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.5">Finding no proper course of action, he **secretly withdrew** before the **imperial concert** (Gyoyū) had ended, and he **entrusted the sword** that was worn at his waist to the **Palace Stewards** (Tonomori Tsukasa) **behind the Shishin-den Hall**, in a place where the **other courtiers could see**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.6">**Iesada** awaited his return and asked, "**Well, how was it?**"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.7">Although Tadamori **wished to tell him everything**, he felt that if he did, Iesada would likely **attempt to force his way into the Palace's inner apartments** (Tenjō) as well, so he replied, "**Nothing happened**."</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.2">Because he was **extremely dark-skinned**, people called him the "**Dark Governor-General** (Kuro Sochi)."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.3">When this man, who was then the **Head Chamberlain** (Kurōdo no Tō), came forward at the Five Annual Ceremonies, they changed the rhythm and mocked him, saying, "**Oh, how black, how black is his head!**</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.4">**What kind of person** has **lacquered** it?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.6">Also, when **Kazan'in**, **former Grand Minister of State Tadamasa no Kō**, was only **ten years old**, he lost his father, **Middle Counselor Tadamune no Kyō**, and was an orphan. **Middle Counselor Fujiwara no Ienari** of the **former Nakamikado household**, who was then **Governor of Harima**, took him as his **son-in-law** and treated him with great favor, so at the Five Annual Ceremonies, people jeered at him, saying, "**Harima rice**, does it **sharpen** like *tokusa* (horsetail), or is it a **mulberry leaf**? It **polishes** a person's **luster**."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.8">In **ancient times**, such things happened, but **no harm came of it**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.9">People said they wondered **what would happen in later ages**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.10"></s></p>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.2">However, **Tadamori no Ason** either summoned a soldier in a **plain robe** (Hōi), calling him a **hereditary retainer**, and kept him waiting in the **small courtyard of the Palace's inner apartments**, or wore a **sword at his waist** while attending the **banquet**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.3">These **two points** are **unprecedented acts of violence**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.4">The **offense is compounded**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.5">He can **certainly not escape punishment** for the crime.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.6">He should **immediately have his commission revoked** and be **suspended from his post**." When they all **petitioned** this, the **Retired Emperor** was **greatly surprised** and **summoned Tadamori** to **question** him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.7">He **explained**, saying, "I was **completely unaware** that a **retainer** was present in the **small courtyard**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.8">However, since people have been **plotting** lately for a reason unknown to me, my **long-time retainer** must have **heard of it** and **secretly** came to guard me to **prevent my disgrace**, without my knowledge; this is a situation beyond my control.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.9">If there is **still a fault**, should I not **summon that man** and **present him**?</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.10">Next, regarding the matter of the sword, I **entrusted it to the Palace Stewards** (Tonomori Tsukasa).</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.11">If it is summoned and examined, a judgment regarding the **nature of the sword** should determine the fault."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.13">He said this, and since it seemed reasonable, the sword was **summoned** and **inspected by the Emperor** (Eiran). Although the **outside** was a **black-lacquered sheath** (Sayamaki), the **inside** was a **wooden sword** (Bokutō) **overlaid with silver foil**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.14">The Emperor said, "Although he **claims to carry a sword to avoid immediate disgrace**, his **foresight in carrying a wooden sword**, knowing that he would be **accused later**, is truly **admirable**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.15">The **strategy** of a man involved in **warfare** should indeed be like this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.16">Furthermore, the fact that a **retainer** was in the **small courtyard** is also simply the **custom of a warrior's retainer**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.17">It is **not Tadamori's fault**."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.18">Thus, he was instead **greatly impressed** and **no judgment of guilt** was made.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.2">**Kaneyasu**, **fearing the Counsellor's resentment** (Saishō no Kaeri Kikan Tokoro o Osorete), **comforted and soothed him** (Itari Nagusame Tatematsuru) in various ways **all along the way**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.3">However, the **Minor Captain** (Shōshō) was **not comforted at all**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.4">He **recited the name of the Buddha** (Hotoke no O-na o nomi Tonōte) day and night and **lamented for his father**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.5">The **New Major Counselor** (Narichika) was **in Kojima** (Kojima ni O-zakeru o) in **Bizen Province**. **Nanba Jirō Tsune-to**, the **guarding warrior** (Azukari no Bushi), moved him to **land** (Ji e Watashi Tatematsuri), thinking it was **too close to the port** (Funatsu Chikōte Warukari nan to Te), and **settled him in a mountain temple** called **Ariki no Betsu-sho** (Ariki no Betsu-sho), in the **Niwase area** (Niwase no Gō), on the **border between Bizen and Bitchū Provinces**.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.6">Since the **distance** between **Seo in Bitchū** (Bitchū no Seo to) and **Ariki no Betsu-sho in Bizen** was **only less than fifty chō** (Wazuka Gojitchō ni Tarinu Tokoro Nare ba), the **Tanba Minor Captain** (Naritsune) perhaps **longed for the direction** (Sono Kata no Kaze mo Sasuga Natsukashiu ya Omoware Ken).

<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.8">Kaneyasu, thinking it would be **bad to tell him directly**, replied, "**It is twelve or thirteen days one way** (Kata Michi Jū-ni San Nite Sōrō)."</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.9">The Minor Captain **shed tears profusely** and said, "Japan originally had **thirty-three provinces**, but in the **middle ages**, it was **divided into sixty-six provinces**.</s>

When he **met an old man** (Rōō no Hitori Yuki Ai Tari-keru ni) on the road back, he asked, "**Sir, you look like a man of old** (Furu-i Hito to Koso Mi Tatematsure), **do you know a place called the Akoya Pine, a famous place in this province?**"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.13">The old man replied, "**It is absolutely not in this province**. It must be in **Dewa Province**."</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.15">The **latter age** (Yo Sue ni Natte) has arrived, and they have **already forgotten all the famous places**."</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.16">As he was about to **pass by disappointed**, the **old man held his sleeve** and said, "**Alas, my lord**, is it not because of the **meaning of this poem** (Kono Uta no Kokoro o Motte) that you speak of the **Akoya Pine** (Akoya no Matsu), a **famous place in this province?**"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.3.17">"**Does the moon that should emerge hide among the trees of the Akoya Pine in Michinoku, unable to come out?**"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.4.1">You say it is a **famous place in this province** because of the **meaning of this poem**?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.9.4.2">That poem was **composed when the two provinces were one country**.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.9.4.4">Sanekata said, "**If that is the case**," and he **crossed into Dewa Province** and **saw the Akoya Pine**.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.1">Around that time, the retired emperor received the secret Shingon teachings from Archbishop Kōken of Miidera: the Mahāvairocana Sūtra, the Vajraśekhara Sūtra, and the Soshitsuji Sūtra. It was said that the abhiṣeka was to be performed at Miidera on the fourth day of the ninth month.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.2">The monks of Enryakuji grew furious: “From ancient times, abhiṣeka and ordination have always been performed at our Mountain. This is precedent!”</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.3">“Above all, the guidance of the mountain deity is for the purpose of ordination and consecration.”</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.4">“If the rite is performed at Miidera, we shall burn the temple to the ground!”</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.5">So they said.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.6">Judging this to be fruitless strife, the retired emperor completed his preparatory practices and abandoned the plan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.1.7">Still, unable to give up his true intention, he brought Archbishop Kōken of Miidera with him to Tennōji, built the Hall of Wisdom Light, took water from Kamei in five vessels as the “water of wisdom,” and there, at that sacred site where the Buddha Dharma first arose, performed the abhiṣeka.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.1">Although the consecration was not held at Miidera to calm the uproar on Mount Hiei, trouble nevertheless arose among the temple attendants and students on the mountain, and battles occurred repeatedly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.2">Each time, the students were defeated and driven out; it seemed as though Enryakuji would fall and the imperial house meet disaster.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.3">The so-called “temple attendants” (dōshū) were youths who had become monks after serving students, or middle attendants turned monks, who since the time of Archbishop Kakujin of Kongōju-in had been organized into the Three Towers as “summer attendants,” offering flowers to the Buddha.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.4">In recent years they had acted independently of the monks, yet now they repeatedly won the battles.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.5">Because they defied their superiors and instigated warfare, the monks reported to the court that they should be swiftly punished and notified the military houses.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.6">By imperial command, Kii province warriors — Yūasa no Gon-no-kami Muneshige and others, over two thousand mounted soldiers — were attached to the monks to assist in suppressing the temple attendants.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.12.2.7">The temple attendants, who had previously stayed at Tōyōbō, descended to the estates of Sanga in Ōmi province, gathered a large force, ascended the mountain again, and fortified themselves at Hayao-zaka.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.1">After that, Enryakuji on Mount Hiei fell ever further into ruin. Aside from the Twelve Meditation Halls, even monks who continued to reside there became scarce; the lectures held in the valleys faded away, and the rituals in the great halls declined.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.2">The windows for study were shut, and the platforms for meditation lay empty.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.3">The spring blossoms of the Four Teachings and Five Periods no longer gave forth fragrance, and the autumn moon of the Threefold Truth now hung dim.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.4">No one remained to tend the Dharma lamp that had burned for over three hundred years, and even the smoke of the incense that should have risen without cease at the six daily services must surely have vanished.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.5">Once, the halls and buildings stood tall, their triple eaves thrust into the blue heavens; their beams rose high, and their verandas stretched into the drifting white mist.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.6">But now, offerings to the Buddha were left to the mountain winds, and golden images stood exposed to the red resin of the pines.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.7">At night, the moonlight shone upon the lamps and leaked through the gaps in the eaves; at dawn, dewdrops hung like jewels and adorned the lotus pedestals.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.8">Alas, as the world slid into this final age, even the Buddhist teachings of the Three Countries declined one after another.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.9">Far away in India, if one visits the traces of the Buddha, the Bamboo Grove Monastery where the Buddha preached, and Jetavana Monastery, are now dens of foxes and jackals, leaving only foundations behind.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.11">Stupas left behind by the sages of the Lesser Vehicle stand moss–covered and leaning.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.12">In China as well, Mount Tiantai, Mount Wutai, the White Horse Temple, and Yùquán Monastery have all fallen into ruin with no residents remaining; the teachings of both Greater and Lesser Vehicles must lie rotting at the bottom of chests.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.13">In our land too, the Seven Great Temples of Nara lie desolate, the Eight and Nine Schools have left no trace. Even Atago and Takao, where once halls and pagodas stood shoulder to shoulder—after a single night’s destruction—became nothing more than dwellings of tengu.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.13.1.14">So perhaps it is no wonder that even the illustrious Tendai teachings have, by the era of Jishō, reached their end. No person of understanding refrains from lamenting their fate.</s>
