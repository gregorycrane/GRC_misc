<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<head type="sub">Subject and Structure.-</head>
<p>The <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title>, one
of the masterpieces of Japanese literature, and also one of the
main sources of the history of the Gempei period, is a poetic
narrative of the fall of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> from the position of supremacy
it had gained under <persName>Taira Kiyomori</persName> to almost complete
destruction. The Heike, like the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, was a warrior clan, but had
quickly lost its hardy simplicity under the influence of life in the
Capital, and identified itself almost entirely with the effeminate
<persName>Fujiwara</persName> Courtiers whose power it had usurped, so that the
struggle between it and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> was really more one between
courtiers and soldiers, between literary officials and military
leaders. Historically this period stands between the Heian era
of soft elegance and the Kamakura age of undiluted militarism.
The Heike were largely a clan of emasculated <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Bushi</foreign>, and their
leader <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, though he obtained his supremacy by force of
arms, assumed the role of Court Noble and strove to rule the
country by the same device of making himself grandfather to
the Emperor as the <persName>Fujiwara</persName> family had previously done.
Hence his rule bears more affinity to theirs than to that of
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>, of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, who made his headquarters in the
Kwanto, well removed from <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> influence and enervation,
and relied entirely on a purely military form of government by
and for <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">samurai</foreign>.
</p>
<p>In its construction the book may be divided roughly into
two parts according to <persName>Mr. Utsumi</persName>, the first half in which the
greatness of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> is depicted and in which <persName>Kiyomori</persName> is the
chief figure, and the second which describes their overthrow, in
which <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> holds the centre of the stage. <persName>Mr. Yamada</persName>,
however, thinks it falls naturally into three sections, the first,
Bks. 1-5; the prosperity of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> with <persName>Kiyomori</persName> as the
central figure. The second, Bks. 6-8; the wandering of the
Heike, <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> being the principal character. The third
<note type="margin-right" place="right">9461</note>
</p>
<pb n="ii" xml:id="p12-ii"/>
<p>section, Bks. 9-12; their destruction, the central figure being
<persName>Kuro Hangwan Yoshitsune</persName>. Whichever division be adopted, the
work has a regular dramatic form quite unlike that of the <title rend="italic">Gempei
Seisuiki</title> or <title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title> which are simply historical chronicles.
</p>
<p>Of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> the two prominent characters are <persName>Kiyomori</persName>
and his son <persName>Shigemori</persName>, the former rash and turbulent, yet a
man of original ideas and at times sympathetic and sensitive, the
latter law-abiding, calm and wise, considerate to his neighbours,
and showing respect to religion and the Imperial House. The
fall of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> is ascribed to the rash and impious folly of
<persName>Kiyomori</persName>, but the writer introduces <persName>Shigemori</persName> into the narrative
most skilfully as a means of exciting the sympathy and
admiration of the reader for his conduct as well as his indignation at his
father's violence, leading to satisfaction that retribution will at
last overtake his clan. <persName>Shigemori</persName> seems to hold back this
retributive destiny as long as he lives, but when he dies the
clouds gather over his house. After his death the headship of
the family falls to his brother <persName>Munemori</persName>, a rather timid and
hesitating character in a crisis, though insolent and overbearing
at other times, and apparently much inferior to his two younger
brothers <persName>Tomomori</persName> and <persName>Shigehira</persName>.
</p>
<p>The first of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> to come on the scene is the veteran
<persName>Yorimasa</persName>, whose premature revolt and gallant end after the
fight at the Ujigawa form a memorable episode in Japanese
history. Then <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> appears and for a while carries
all before him. A vigorous and brilliant leader, he seems to
have lacked wisdom and sagacity and soon fell a victim like
<persName>Yukiie</persName> to the jealousy and guile of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>. The leadership
of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> forces then devolves on <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> and the narrative
goes on to relate his victories and final destruction of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> is the ideal type of attractive character in Japan.
Youthful and dashing, cunning graceful and elegant, quite
unlike the solid and worthy <persName>Shigemori</persName> with his placidity and
rather narrow-minded piety, <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> might be put in the
same category with <persName>Nelson</persName> or <persName>Coeur-de-Leon</persName>, with allowances
</p>
<pb n="iii" xml:id="p13-iii"/>
<p>for period and nationality, while <persName>Shigemori</persName> mightily suggests
<persName>Aeneas</persName>. The whole drama is represented from a Buddhist
standpoint as an example of cause and effect working itself out in
action, the evanescence of all prosperity and dominion being
strongly insisted on.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section">
<head type="sub">Authorship and Date.-</head>
<p>The authorship and date of the
<title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title>, as well as its relation to the other literature
of the Kamakura period, have been the subject of much
discussion among Japanese scholars of the present time, and no
exact pronouncement can be made. <persName>Mr. Utsumi</persName> says in the
'<title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari Hyoshaku</title> :' As to the various statements
that it was the work of <persName>Shinano-no-Zenji Yukinaga</persName>, or <persName>Hamuro
Tokinaga</persName>, or <persName>Minamoto Mitsuyuki</persName>, one cannot adopt any one
of them with certainty, but the following conclusions have
been reached by the Society for the Investigation of the
National Literature, in their monograph on this work: 
<list type="ordered">
<item>(a), that
the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> was originally composed in three volumes
which were afterwards increased to six, and that these were
again altered to twelve;</item>
<item>(b), that it was composed sometime
before the period Shokyu (1219) and enlarged during the time
of the <orgName>Fujiwara</orgName> Shoguns (1219-1252);</item>
<item>(c) that the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Kancho</foreign>
volume was not originally separate from the rest of the work;</item>
<item>(d) that there was one original source of the work, but that as it
circulated it became altered and added to, and that these additions
and alterations are the work of different hands at different periods."</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The most explicit statement about the authorship is
contained in the <title rend="italic">Tsurezure Gusa</title> of <persName>Yoshida Kenko</persName>, (1281-1350) Section 226, which is considered by most scholars likely
to be correct. It runs as follows: "In the time of the Retired
Emperor <persName>Go-Toba</persName>, <persName>Shinano-no-Zenji Yukinaga</persName> was renowned
for his knowledge of musical matters, so that he was once
summoned to take part in a discussion about them, but
forgetting two of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Shichi Toku no Mai</foreign>, Dances of the Seven Virtues,
he was nicknamed '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Go Toku no Kwanja</foreign>' or 'The Young
Master of Five Virtues,' and this he took so much to heart that
</p>
<pb n="iv" xml:id="p14-iv"/>
<p>he forsook his studies and became a recluse; but the priest
<persName>Jichin</persName>, who would take in anyone, however low his rank, if he
had any artistic gift, felt sympathy for him and provided him
with what he needed. It was this lay priest <persName rend="italic">Yukinaga</persName> who
wrote the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> and taught a certain blind man
named <persName rend="italic">Jobutsu</persName> to recite it. He wrote especially well about the
affairs of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and his detailed knowledge of <persName>Kuro Hangwan</persName>
(<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>) enabled him to describe him graphically. Of
<persName rend="italic">Kaba-no-Kwanja</persName> (<persName>Noriyori</persName>) he does not seem to have had so
much information, for he omits much concerning him. For
matters pertaining to the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Bushi</foreign> and their horses and arms,
<persName rend="italic">Jobutsu</persName>, who was a native of the East Country, was able to tell
him what he had learned from asking the warriors themselves.
And the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Biwa-hoshi</foreign> of the present time learn to imitate the
natural voice of this <persName rend="italic">Jobutsu</persName>."
</p>
<p>This <persName>Yukinaga</persName> appears to have been the son of the
<persName>Yukitaka</persName> mentioned in this work (vol. 3. Yukitaka no Sata no
Koto) who was steward to the <persName>Sessho Kanezane</persName>, whose younger
brother the priest <persName>Jichin</persName> may have been. In this case he is to
be identified with the <persName>Yukinaga</persName>, former Governor of
<placeName>Shimozuke</placeName>, who is mentioned in the <title rend="italic">Gyokuyo Meigetsuki</title> as having
ability in literary affairs. The priest <persName>Jichin</persName> was the <persName>Tendai
Zasshu Jien Dai-Sojo</persName>, afterwards known as <persName>Jichin Daishi Zasshu</persName>
of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, which would account for the writer's accurate
knowledge of that monastery. With regard to <persName>Jobutsu</persName>,
of whom nothing is otherwise known, the name is conjectured to
be a mistaken reading for <persName rend="italic">Shobutsu <foreign xml:lang="jpn">E</foreign></persName>, the religious name
of <persName>Minamoto Suketoki</persName>. This <persName>Suketoki</persName> was born in the family
of <persName>Ayakoji</persName>, which was noted for its musical traditions, and
'himself became the best musician of his time, eventually retiring
from the world and taking up his abode with the priest <persName>Jichin</persName>.
This attribution of the authorship to <persName>Yukinaga</persName> certainly gains
much force when we note that the chapter concerning <persName>Yukitaka</persName>
is quite unconnected with the main story and would be very well
explained as an incident related by the author about his father
</p>
<pb n="v" xml:id="p15-v"/>
<p>which he thought worth preserving as an example of the
fickleness of fortune.
</p>
<p>Another statement is found in the <title rend="italic">Daigo Zassho</title> to the
effect that <persName>Mimbu-no-Shosho Tokinaga</persName> wrote the <title rend="italic">Heike
Monogatari</title> in twenty four volumes, and yet another that <persName>Suketsune</persName>
wrote it in twelve volumes. The first may refer to a later
redaction of the work of <persName>Yukinaga</persName> or be merely a mistaken
reading of his name, whereas concerning the latter, it is not
improbable that he may have been one of the redactors, for
there is a chapter in the 12th vol., entitled <title>Yoshida Dainagon
no Sata</title>, relating to his grandfather <persName>Tsunefusa</persName>, which also
seems to be inserted without any special reason. Thus it is quite
certain that the work as originally composed not long after the
events of which it treats took place was not the same as that
which is now current. The oldest known manuscript of it is
one of the period Enkei, (1308-11), and while its contents are
rather less than those of the <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title>, it is about twice as
long as the ordinary current editions. By a critical comparison
of this with other known MSS, the six books it contains
may be divided fairly easily so as to give twelve volumes,
As the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> was intended for recitation to the
accompaniment of the biwa, it is not surprising that there should
be in existence a large number of variant editions as used by the
different schools of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Biwahoshi</foreign>, each of which had its own
traditions and version, and therefore the work has been peculiarly
liable to change and corruption of the text as well as addition to
it at various periods. Among these variant versions there are
two main sources, one known as the school of <persName>Ichikata</persName> from its
originator <persName>Akashi Kenko Kyoichi</persName>, and the other as the <persName>Yasaka</persName>
school from its founder <persName>Yasaka Kenko Kigen</persName>. The
characteristic difference between them is that the former combines the
incidents of the entry of <persName>Kenrei-mon-in</persName> into <placeName>Ohara</placeName> and the visit
of the Emperor to the same place into a separate volume called
the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Kanjin Maki</foreign>, whereas the other does not.
</p>
<p>One of the best MSS of the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> belongs to
</p>
<pb n="vi" xml:id="p16-vi"/>
<p>the school of <persName rend="italic">Kyoichi</persName> and is a National Treasure kept at <placeName>Koryo
Jinja</placeName>, a shrine in the province of <placeName>Chikugo</placeName>. It is dated O-an
(1368) and is the oldest MS of the Ichihata school: it is taken
as the basis of the edition of <persName>Yamada</persName> and <persName>Takagi</persName>. It does not
contain the story of <persName rend="italic">Giyo</persName> and <persName rend="italic">Ginyo</persName> or the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Saisho Minage</foreign>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section">
<head type="sub">Buddhist Tendency of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.-</head>
<p>One of the most
noticeable characteristics of the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> is its strong
religious atmosphere, the continual moralizing on the events
described from the standpoint of Buddhist philosophy, with its
insistence on the vanity and impermanence of the things of this
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Shaba</foreign> world, and the desirability of retiring from its turmoils
to prepare for the blessed rebirth in the world to come. So
much is the work pervaded by this tendency that many have
maintained that it was written for the purposes of propaganda,
and that the religious element in it is the main motive.
</p>
<p>This view, however, seems to be much too extreme, as
there is no reason to suppose that the inclination to quote
Buddhist sentiments is any greater than might be expected in an age
when Buddhism was so potent an influence everywhere. The
Gempei period was essentially the time when the emotional
aspect of Buddhism was most marked, and when, under the
pressure of affliction and wretchedness, of which a very vivid
picture is given in the '<title rend="italic">Hojoki</title>' of <persName>Kamo Chomei</persName>, the former
ritual and esoteric cults of Tendai and Shingon gave place to the
simple and evangelical sects of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Jodo</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Shinshu</foreign>, developed
respectively by <persName>Honen</persName> and his disciple <persName>Shinran</persName>. Consequently
we find the expressions '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">raisei ojo</foreign>,' '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">saiho jodo</foreign>,' and others
used by these sects, of very frequent occurrence in this work
and this fact has led some critics to describe it as a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Jodo</foreign> sermon,
taking the <orgName>Heike</orgName> as its text. When we consider, however, that
the writer does not by any means confine himself to such phrases,
nor to the adoration of <persName>Amida Buddha</persName>, the special object of
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Jodo</foreign> worship, but shows respect and reverence for many other
Buddhas, beside the national Kami, and the deities of the great
shrines, there seems no sufficient reason for such a view. It is
</p>
<pb n="vii" xml:id="p17-vii"/>
<p>quite natural that the tragic story of the sudden rise and fall of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house should call forth reflections on the
impermanence of worldly affairs, seeing that these ideas formed the
background of the thought of the age, and that the author was a
recluse in a Buddhist monastery, as were almost all the men
of letters of the time. Moreover, no doubt Buddhist phrases
were considered to lend dignity and sonority to the narrative, as
well as being a mark of the author's learning and taste, just as
the continual citation of instances from Chinese history with
which the book abounds served to edify those acquainted with it.
</p>
<p>These details correspond to the religious phraseology and
classical references to be found in an English medieval writer
like <persName>Chaucer</persName>, whose age was not, perhaps, very dissimilar. Thus
not the least interesting part of the <title rend="italic">Heike Manogatari</title> for
European readers is the detailed description of Japanese Buddhism at
this, its most flourishing period, and not only of Buddhism but
of the many other cults that the excessively superstitious
Courtiers and Buke feared to leave unobserved. The Heike chiefs
seem to have left nothing to chance in these matters, as may be
especially noted in the elaborate consultations and ceremonies
connected with the birth of the son of <persName>Ken-rei-mon-in</persName>. So far
as can be noted all these things were merely ritual and
ceremonial and did not necessarily produce any more effect on
ordinary conduct than Christianity did on that of <persName>Benvenuto
Cellini</persName>, but like it they gave occupation to many artists and
craftsmen and afforded a solace in times of adversity, which
might, in such a period, suddenly befall even those apparently
most secure, and were not unknown to the Mikado himself. So
the stately opening words of the first chapter seem most
appropriate :
</p>
<lg type="poem" xml:lang="jpn-Latn">
<l>Gion Shōja no kane no koe,</l>
<l>Shōgyō mujo no hibiki ari;</l>

<p>The mighty are indeed put down from their seats, but those

<div type="textpart" subtype="section">
<head type="sub">The Heike Monogatari and Other Works of the
Period.-</head>
<p>There has been much discussion among scholars as to
the connexion between the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> and the <title rend="italic">Gempei
Seisuiki</title>, some considering that the former work was composed
first and the latter adapted from it, while others adopt the
converse view, supposing that the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> consists of such passages
selected from the <title rend="italic">Seisuiki</title> as are most suitable for recitation.
<persName>Yamada Toshio</persName> in his edition of the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> thinks however that
the two books are simply different recensions of the same
original and cannot be said to be really two different works.
'<title>The
Gempei Seisuiki</title> seems," he says, " to be a work to be contrasted,
not with the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title>, but with the version of the
<persName>Yasaka</persName> school." <persName>Mr. Utsumi</persName> in his notes considers this is not
quite in accordance with the facts, for the material, construction,
and treatment of the subject is quite different in the two works,
but agrees that the <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title> was probably taken from
the other book and not vice-versa, thus assigning the priority to
the <title rend="italic">Heike</title>, and this view seems the prevalent one among the best
modern critics. The late <persName>Dr. Fujioka</persName> however, in his
‘<title>Literature of the Kamakura and Muromachi periods</title>', takes the opposite
view and considers that as the <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title> is arranged
according to chronological order and is principally concerned
with the collection of facts, whereas the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> represents rather
an arrangement according to subject matter, having literary
elegance as its main object, it follows that the former cannot be
derived from the latter, but that the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> must be the result of
a digestion of the material of the <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title>. This
argument is not however acquiesced in by most scholars, seeing that
the <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title> is the most ornate and profuse of the two,
and seems by no means likely to have been anterior in time.
</p>
<pb n="ix" xml:id="p19-ix"/>
<p>Moreover there appear to be many instances of mistakes in the
<title rend="italic">Seisuiki</title> which could only have arisen from a misunderstanding
of words or expressions in the <title rend="italic">Heike</title>.
</p>
<p>Another work of the same period having some relation to
the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> is the <title rend="italic">Hojoki</title> of <persName>Kamo Chomei</persName>. In this little book
of reflections are related the incidents of the Great Fire, (<title rend="italic">Heike</title>,
Vol. 1. <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nairi Yakiage no koto</foreign>. <title rend="italic">Seisuiki</title> Vol. 4.); The Great
Typhoon, (<title rend="italic">Heike</title> Vol. 3.); The Migration of the Court to
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>; The Great Earthquake, (<title rend="italic">Heike</title> Vol. 12.); the
description being very similar, while that of the cell of
<persName>Kenreimon-in</persName> on <placeName>Oharayama</placeName> in the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Kancho Maki</foreign> or appendix to the
<title rend="italic">Heike</title>, and also in the <title rend="italic">Seisuiki</title>, bears a strong resemblance to
<persName>Chomei's</persName> hut on <placeName>Hinosan</placeName>. In this case also opinions differ as to
which has borrowed from the other, but the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari
Ko</title>, published by the <orgName>Kokugo Chushakai</orgName>, states that the
plagiarism is on the side of the <title rend="italic">Heike</title>, and the <title rend="italic">Hojoki</title> is the prior
source. Now the <title rend="italic">Hojoki</title> is dated the second year of Kenryaku,
1212 A.D., so this, if correct, would give a terminus a quo for
these parts at least. <persName>Dr. Fujioka</persName>, however, considers the <title rend="italic">Hojoki</title>
a compilation of later date and not the work of <persName>Kamo Chomei</persName>
at all.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section">
<head type="sub">Style of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> Monogatari.-</head>
<p>A critic has said of
the three works that have always been regarded as the finest
representatives of the War Chronicle (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Senki-bun</foreign>) literature,
namely, the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title>, the <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title>, and the
<title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title>, that the style of the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> is elegant and that of the
<title rend="italic">Seisuiki</title> is grand, but as that of the <title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title> combines both
qualities, it must be regarded as the perfect War Chronicle.'
<persName>Mr. Utsumi</persName>, however, does not agree with this pronouncement;
and considers that though it may be conceded that the <title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title>
is perhaps the most perfect type of this kind of literature, it
certainly does not contain the characteristics of the other two.
<hi rend="italic">It
may be true to some extent that elegance is a feature of the
Heike, but this aspect has been rather over-emphasized by the

</p>
<pb n="x" xml:id="p20-x"/>
<p>soberness and restraint of the writing combined with the skilful
construction of the narrative.
</p>
<p>He would consider the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> as surpassing the other two
works, first in its general construction and dramatic plan,
secondly in the handling of the material, and again in the skill in
word-painting, but especially so in its narrative style, in which
the <title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title> is its closest rival. This difference between them
is rather to be explained as follows. The <title rend="italic">Gempei Seisuiki</title> has
many shortcomings in its narrative, but at the same time it
occasionally rises to heights of eloquence that are unequalled by
the other two. It may be compared to a landscape composed
of a dreary plain through which one plods on till one is suddenly
confronted with a lofty mountain soaring up to the heavens or a
vast extent of sea stretching out to the horizon, whereas the
impression made by the <title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title> and the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> is rather that of
a well watered and wooded series of hills and valleys, relieved
by flowers and foliage of varied hues, from any point of which a
pleasing outlook may be obtained, and which diverts the mind
by its retrospect as well as by its promise of what is to come.
Such fine writing as, for instance, the description of the advance
at the Ujigawa or the Hiyodorigoe, is not to be found in the
<title rend="italic">Heike</title>, but on the whole this kind of description in the <title rend="italic">Seisuiki</title>
is of a somewhat theatrical nature, and the writer is apt to make
mistakes owing to an inclination to appear learned and knowing
in all things. The narrative of the <title rend="italic">Heike</title> is written lightly and
easily and depicts the condition of things both internally and
externally with a few touches. Though lively and vivid, it avoids
harshness. The <title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title>, though using much detail and
taking great pains to describe a scene with care and the proper
sentiments, is a little heavy and lacking in taste by comparison.
The special accomplishment of the latter work is its coining and
use of Chinese expressions which are worked into the Japanese
language with much skill and sonorous effect, though this is at
times perhaps slightly overdone. Thus the excellencies of the
<title rend="italic">Taiheiki</title> rather lie open for anyone to see, whereas those of the
<pb n="xi" xml:id="p21-xi"/>
<title rend="italic">Heike</title> are not so obvious and require some literary taste for
their appreciation.
</p>
<p>
Again, though the material of these works consists mostly
of details of war and strife, yet in the handling of this material
the <title rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</title> differs widely from the other two, in that,
though not so pre-eminent in describing the actual clash of arms,
'the thunder of the captains and the shouting,' it emphasises the
underlying motives and incidental circumstances, pathetic or
humorous or otherwise, in a manner that the others do not
attempt. Beside being an age of strife it was, as for that matter
all ages are, a period of transition, and thus we see portrayed
the clash of ideas accompanying it, and the struggle between the
views of the age that was passing away and of that which was
taking its place. The writer seizes on the collision of the elegant
and effeminate ideals and way of life of the Heian period with
the comparatively rough and rude manners of the sterner <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn" rend="italic">Bushi</foreign>
who were henceforth to predominate in the administration of the
country, as a means of touching the feelings of the reader by a
recital of the pathetic stories of its victims. These victims were
always young people, and especially young women, and the
narrator evidently has much sympathy with their sad fate.]
Examples of this kind are the narratives entitled: <persName rend="italic">Gio</persName>; <title>Twice an
Empress</title>; <persName rend="italic">Aoi-no-Mae</persName>; <persName rend="italic">Kogo</persName>; <title>The Wife of Koremori</title>; <persName
rend="italic">KoSaisho</persName>; <persName rend="italic">Dairi-Nyobo</persName>; <persName rend="italic">Senju</persName>; <persName rend="italic">Yokobue</persName>, etc., and especially
delicately drawn is the scene entitled <title>Moon-viewing</title>, in the fifth
volume. The same contrast is emphasized in the case of
<persName>Kiyomori</persName>, the founder of the new era, and the younger nobles of his
house who rather favour the elegant style of the former age.

<head>PREFACE [to the second volume]</head>
<p><pb xml:id="p13"/>The present volume completes the translation of the
<title>Heike Monogatari</title> from the events that followed the death of
<persName>Taira Kiyomori</persName> down to the complete destruction of his house
at the battle of <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName>, and the fate of those who survived
that defeat. With this the main work ends, and the <title>Kanchō
Maki</title> which follows is an appendix describing the after
adventures and death of the <persName>Former Empress Kenrei-mon-in</persName>. Its
style seems to be of a later age than the principal work, and
approaches somewhat to that of the Nō plays of more than a
century later.
</p>
<p>
The <title>Book of Swords</title> is another appendix found only in
some MSS of the book, and is, no doubt, also of comparatively
late date. Its inspiration is of Shinto, and not of Buddhism,
as is perhaps natural, and its purpose seems to be to point out
how the history of the country was shaped by the deities
through the supernatural power that resided in these swords.
</p>
<p>
The stories of the origin of the name Nippon, and
of the Sacred Seal, are interesting examples of that
combination called Ryōbu Shinto. Another object was to show
that the sword that was lost in the sea at the drowning of the
<persName>Emperor Antoku</persName> was not the real Sacred Sword, but a copy,
which deceived the <persName>Dragon King</persName> of the waters as well as the
<persName>Heike</persName>. The Sea Deity, who has usually distinct Buddhist
characteristics, is here identified with the <persName>Orochi</persName> in whose tail
the Sacred Sword was found. The derivation of place-names
from various mythological incidents found in this book is
curiously reminiscent of Old Testament methods. The author
seems to regard the Sacred Treasures as the Urim and
Thummim or Tablets of Destiny of his country.
</p>
<p>
The list of Sanskrit and Chinese words is added as a further
<pb xml:id="p14"/>
explanation of the Japanese equivalents used in the text, and
to show the direction in which the literature of the Kamakura
age borrowed from these sources. <title>Eitel's Chin. Sansk.
Dictionary</title> and <title>Rosenberg's Jap. Chin. Sansk. Dictionary</title> have
been used in its preparation as well as <title>Mayer's Chinese Reader's
Manual</title>.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion I wish to express my thanks to <persName>Mr. Fukui</persName>,
Professor of Japanese Literature, and to <persName>Dr. Okada</persName>, Professor
of Chinese Literature, in the Peers' College for their kind
explanation of some obscure passages.

<head>THE ASSASSINATION AT COURT.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Tadamori</persName>, while holding the office of <persName>Bizen no-Kami</persName>,
by the request of the retired <persName>Emperor Toba</persName>, had built the
temple <placeName>Toku-cho-juin</placeName> and the <placeName>San-ju-san-gen-do</placeName>, or hall 33 <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">ken</foreign>
long, within which were one thousand and one Buddhas; its
first festival being on the thirteenth day of the third month of
the first year of <placeName>Tensho</placeName>. As a reward he was honoured by
receiving the territory of the province of <placeName>Tamba</placeName>, which then
happened to be unappropriated. Moreover the Emperor of his
bounty graciously permitted him to attend the Court; which
<persName>Tadamori</persName> did for the first time at the age of thirty six. But
<pb n="3" xml:id="p27-3"/>

the higher Courtiers were furious with jealousy and plotted to
assasinate him on the evening of the festival of <persName>Go-Sechi Toyo-no-akari-no-setchie</persName>, on the 23rd day of the eleventh month of
the same year. <persName>Tadamori</persName>, who was not a civil official, being
born of a line of warriors, on hearing of this was troubled in his
heart for himself and his house at this unexpected shame that
was come upon hin, but finally, as he was in duty bound to
serve his August Master under all conditions, he made his
preparations heforehand. Before entering the Court he
provided himself with a long dirk which he girt on under his long
court dress, and turning aside to a dimly lit place, slowly drew
the blade, and passed it through the hair of his head so that it
gleamed afar off with an icy sheen, causing all to stare
openeyed. Moreover a retainer of <persName>Tadamori</persName>, by birth of the same
family, a grandson of <persName>Taira no Mokunosuke Sadamitsu</persName> and son
of <persName>Shinno Saburodaiyu Iefusa</persName>, <persName>Sahyoe-no-jo Iesada</persName> by name,
wearing a body armour laced with bright green under a light
green "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign>" or loose overdress, and carrying under his
arm a “<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">tachi</foreign>” with a bowstring bag attached, was waiting in
the "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koniwa</foreign>," the small court by the <placeName>Seiryoden</placeName>.

unsuitable costume should be within the balustrade of the steps
of the Court near the bell-rope of the library, and wondering if
he was not some disorderly fellow, an official of the sixth rank
ordered him to depart quickly. But <persName>Iesada</persName> thus replied:
"Because I have heard that to-night they will try to kill my
Lord <persName>Bizen-no-kami dono</persName> have I come hither"; and he
remained there and did not depart. And they saw that there
was nothing more to be done; and thus the attempt did not
take place.
</p>
<p>But when <persName>Tadamori</persName> danced in the August presence of the
Mikado at his Imperial wish, the others mocked at him,
changing the words of the music and singing "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Ise heiji wa
sugame nari</foreign>,” ("the winepot of Ise has turned into a vinegar
jar.") In thus mentioning the vessels of his province they
punned on his title of <persName>Ise-heishi</persName>; and since <persName>Tadamori</persName> had a
squint in one eye (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sugame</foreign>) they also alluded to this in the
lampoon. <persName>Tadamori</persName>. not being able to do anything, left the
Presence before the entertainment had ended, and going behind
the <placeName>Shishinden</placeName>, a place that could be seen by everyone,
deposited the sword that he was carrying at his side in the
hands of the <orgName>Tonomo-no-tsukasa</orgName>. <persName>Iesada</persName>, who was waiting for
his lord, immediately asked him what had happened, but he,
though greatly wishing to tell him, seeing in his face the
expression of one who would even do violence in the Palace itself
should he tell him the truth, merely answered that nothing out
of the common had taken place.

had been accustomed to be mentioned in the songs that
accompanied the dance, but there was a certain <persName>Dazai Gon-no-sotsu
Suenaka no Kyo</persName> who was of so dark a complexion that the
people of his time called him "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kuro-sotsu</foreign>" (or "black <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sotsu</foreign>,")
and while he was holding the office of <persName>Kurando-no-to</persName>, when he
danced before the August Presence, they changed the words to:
"Oh what a black, black head; someone must have painted him
with lacquer." Also the former Prime Minister of <placeName>Kwanzan-nc-
In</placeName>, <persName>Prince Tadamasa</persName>, who was left an orphan when only ten
years old owing to the death of his father <persName>Chunagon Tadamune
no Kyo</persName>, was received as son-in-law by the <persName>To-Chunagon
Kasei-no-Kyo</persName> in the time of <persName>Go Naka no Mikado</persName>, when he held
the office of <persName>Harima no kami</persName>, and it was an exceedingly
gorgeous bridal, so that at the <persName>Go sechie</persName> of this time they japed
at him with the refrain; "The rice of <placeName>Harima</placeName>, the scouring rush
and the "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">muku</foreign>" leaves, they polish up people's fine raiment.'.
</p>
<note type="footnote">White paper etc. intended to suggest metaphorically the dances of
women.</note>
<p>Though long ago such things had happened, nothing had been
done, and now people said that what was to be done was
doubtful. As he had expected after the conclusion of the
festival, all the courtiers and officials together appealed against
him; for coming to a Court entertainment wearing a sword and
bringing military retainers within the Court Precincts were
things strictly regulated according to rank: for this there was
Imperial Order and ancient precedent. But <persName>Ason Tadamori</persName>
had stationed a soldier wearing common dress, said to be a
retainer of his family, in the small court of the Palace, and had
come to the <persName>Go-Sechie</persName> wearing a sword by his side, and both
these counts were acts of disorder such as were seldom met
with heretofore. Indeed it was one crime piled on another, a
charge he would find it difficult to escape. All the Court
Nobles together petitioned that his name should be erased from
the list of Courtiers and that he herewith be deprived of rank and
<pb n="6" xml:id="p30-6"/>

office. His Majesty the Mikado, greatly surprised, ordered
<persName>Tadamori</persName> into his Presence to make examination into the affair.
In his reply he stated that as to the presence of his retainer in
the Palace, he certainly knew nothing about it but if his
retainers had heard of the designs that people were plotting
against him lately, and in order to help him against such
dishonour had come hither secretly without informing him,
then he had no power to prevent it. "But if there be any
blame, do I not yield my body herewith; as for the matter of
the sword, I deposited it in the <orgName>Tonomotsukasa</orgName>, and if it be
brought out from thence, it may be seen if it be a real sword or
not." As this seemed quite plausible, they hastened to bring forth
the sword and exhibit it. Its outside was that of a dirk in a black
lacquer sheath, but within was only a wooden blade covered with
silver. Although he had displayed the appearance of a sword to
avoid dishonour, his substitution of a wooden blade as a
precaution against an after accusation was exceeding praiseworthy.
A plan like this is very commendable in a warrior. That his
retainer should have been in attendance in the court of the Palace
this too is an example for retainers of the "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">bushi</foreign>." So no fault
was found in <persName>Tadamori</persName>, but, on the contrary, his conduct was
greatly admired, and he was pronounced guiltless.

<p>There was a fair lady-in-waiting in the <placeName>Sendo Palace</placeName> of the
ex-Midado much beloved by <persName>Tadamori</persName>, whom he was wont to
visit every evening. And it chanced that one night, after so
doing he left in her room a fan painted with the rising moon;
the other ladies seeing it were much amused, saying: "Oh how
doubtful is the place where the moon has risen! : to which the
lady replied:—

Thus showing that her wit was not at all shallow. This
was the mother of <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName>; as people are
drawn to each other by similar dispositions, <persName>Tadamori's</persName> taste

fifteenth day of the first month of the third year of <placeName>Ninpei</placeName>. His
eldest son <persName>Kiyomori</persName> followed in his footsteps. In the first year
of <placeName>Hogen</placeName>, when the <persName>Sadaijin of Uji</persName> brought the realm into
disorder, he put himself at the head of the Imperial party and
<pb n="8" xml:id="p32-8"/>

was rewarded for his services. At first he had the office of
<persName>Aki-no-kami</persName>, then he was promoted to be <persName>Harima-no-kami</persName>, and
in the third year of the same era he became <persName>Dazai-no-dai-ni</persName>.
In the twelfth month of the first year of <placeName>Heiji</placeName>, at the time of the
rebellion of <persName>Nobuyori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitomo</persName>, he beat down the rebels
in the Imperial cause, and the rewards bestowed on him for
many meritorious deeds by the August kindness were very
great. In the next year he received the Senior Third Rank,
and succeeded to the titles of <persName>Saisho Eifu-no-kami</persName>, and <persName>Kebiishi-no-Betto</persName> one after the other, and passing over the ranks of
<persName>Chunagon</persName> and <persName>Dainagon</persName>, took rank as a Minister of State.
He did not even become Minister of the Left or Right, but
rose straight from <persName>Naidaijin</persName> to be <persName>Dajodaijin</persName> of the Lower
First Rank. Though not a commander of armies, he went
armed and surrounded by retainers, and by special permission
of the Retired Emperor, entered and departed from the Court
riding in state in ox-wagon or palanquin, acting as one who
holds alone the whole power of administration. Since it was
the function of the <persName>Dajodaijin</persName> to be a pattern and example of
virtue to the whole country, to consider which was the right
course in ruling, and to tranquillize the universe by his
government, if such an one could not be found, the office was to be
declared vacant, for except it were held by such an one, the
office would surely be polluted. Now that this lay-monk of a
Governor should hold the Heaven and the Four Seas in the
hollow of his hand, verily there is no need for further speech.

it to the favour of the <persName>Gongen</persName>. As we have said, he was on
religious pilgrimage, so that he was observing the ten

departing from these, he cooked the fish himself and ate of it
and gave also to his childr.n who were with him. And
afterwards nought but good fortune attended him and he at last
became <persName>Dajodaijin</persName>. His posterity too attained high office more

<p>Now Prince <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, being overtaken by illness on the
eleventh day of the eleventh month of <placeName>Ninan</placeName>, at the age of fifty
one, retired from the world and took monk's vows to save his
life, assuming the religious name of <persName>Jokai</persName>. As the result of this,
his sickness departed and he was cured, fulfilling the decree of
destiny. Yet after his retirement from the world he did not put
an end to his luxurious living. People obeyed him as grass
before the wind, and depended on him as the earth does on the
rain that moistens it. If one speaks of the Princes of the house
of <placeName>Rokuhara dono</placeName>, they were most noble and illustrious, and
none might be considered equal to them. Moreover as for the
brother of the <persName>Nyudo's</persName> wife, <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada Kyo</persName>,-
all those who did not belong to his house were to be considered
people of no position, so that everyone was wishing to make
alliance with him. From the manner of wearing the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">eboshi</foreign> "
to the style of the crest on clothes, everything must be in the
fashion of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>; so that everyone from one end of the
land to the other studied it.

case of the political actions of Regent or Prime Minister,
(<persName>Sessho Kwampaku</persName>) it is a usual thing that certain worthless
fellows will gather together to speak ill of him; but against this
lay-priest in his prosperity there was not even a casual breath
of reviling. And for what reason? Even because, by the
device of this monk-regent, about three hundred youths of
from fourteen to sixteen years old, having purified themselves
and polled their heads, wearing red robes, were everywhere
patrolling the streets of the Capital. And if there was anyone
who spoke evil against the <orgName>Taira</orgName> house, and one of these
chanced to hear it, straightway summoning to him his fellows,
they would violently enter that man's house, seize his
treasures and household goods and bring him bound to <placeName>Roku-hara</placeName>. So that none were found to open their mouth about the
things they saw or knew. At the very name of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kamuro</foreign> of
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> everyone, both pedestrians and those who rode in
carriages, made wide room and passed by on the other side.
Even when entering or leaving the forbidden gate of the Palace,
it was not necessary to declare their name, for the officials of
the city looked with averted eyes where they were concerned.

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>THE SPLENDOUR OF KIYOMORI.</head>
<p>Not only did <persName>Kiyomori</persName> himself live in splendour and
luxury, but all his house likewise shared his prosperity. His
eldest son <persName>Shigemori</persName> was <persName>Naidaijin</persName> and <persName>Sadaisho</persName>, his second
son <persName>Munemori</persName> was <persName>Chunagon</persName> and <persName>Udaisho</persName>, his third son <persName>Tomo-
mori</persName> was <persName>Chujo</persName> of the third grade, his eldest grandson <persName>Kore-
mori</persName> <persName>Shosho</persName> of the fourth grade; sixteen of his house in all
held offices of the higher grade (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kugyo</foreign>), while thirty had right
of entry to Court. The whole number of his family who drew
revenues from the provinces as military officials were about
sixty persons. All others appeared as of no account in the
world. Since long ago in the era of <persName>Nara no Mikado</persName> the office</p>
<p>To resume, another of <persName>Kiyomori's</persName> daughters became
Consort of the Emperor, and bore a Prince at the age of
twenty two. On this child attaining the rank of Crown Prince,
she retired from the world and was known by the name of
<persName>Ken-rei-mon-in</persName>. Concerning this daughter of the Lay-priest
Chancellor, since she has risen to the rank of Mother of the
Emperor, there is no need of further description. Another
daughter became the wife of the <persName>Regent Rokujo</persName>. She it was
who, during the reign of the <persName>Retired Emperor Takakura</persName>,
became Imperial Foster-mother, and gained the title of <persName>Jun-san-
go</persName> by Imperial Edict. She went by the name of <persName>Shirakawa-
den</persName>, and was a personage of exceeding importance. Yet
another daughter had become the wife of <persName>Fugenji dono</persName>;
another of <persName>Reizei-no-Dainagon Ryubo-no-Kyo</persName>, and another of
<persName>Shichijo Shuri-no-Taiyu Nobutaka-no-Kyo</persName>. One daughter
also he had by a lady-in-waiting of the shrine of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in
<placeName>Aki</placeName>, and she had the honour of becoming attendant on the
<persName>Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa</persName>. Beside her also a Palace-
attendant at <placeName>Kujo-no-in</placeName> named <persName>Tokiwa</persName> bore him a daughter
who became lady-in-waiting to <persName>Kawazan-no-in dono</persName>, and was
styled <persName>Ro-no-on-kata</persName> (Unofficial Empress). Now <placeName>Nippon
Akitsushima</placeName> has but sixty six provinces; and of these the
domains of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were thirty; almost half the land. Beside
these the manors, rice-fields and gardens that they possessed
<pb n="13" xml:id="p37-13"/>

were without number. In the multiplicity of their gorgeous
costumes they were resplendent as the flowers of the
field; the noble and illustrious crowded before their gates
like a throng in the marketplace: the gold of <placeName>Yoshu</placeName>, the
jewels of <placeName>Keishu</placeName>, the damask of <placeName>Gokun</placeName>, the brocade of
<placeName>Shiyyokko</placeName>—of the seven rarities and the myriad treasures:
not one was lacking. For poetry and music, fishing and
riding, perchance even the Mikado's Palaces were not more
renowned.

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>GIO.</head>
<p>Now not only did this priestly statesman hold the whole
country in the hollow of his hand, but, neither ashamed at the
censure of the world, nor regarding the derision of the people,
he indulged in the most surprising conduct. For example, in
the Capital there were two famous "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign>" who were
sisters, named <persName>Gio</persName> and <persName>Ginyo</persName>, both young girls and very skilled
in their art. The elder, <persName>Gio</persName>, was beloved by <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, and
her younger sister also was in high favour with everyone. So
they were enabled to build a good house for their mother, who
was granted a monthly income of a hundred <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koku</foreign> of rice, and
a hundred <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kwan</foreign> in money by <persName>Kiyomori</persName>. Their family was
consequently rich and honoured, fortunate beyond the lot of
most people. Now the origin of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign> in our country
was in the reign of <persName>Toba-in</persName> when <persName>Shima-no-chisai</persName> and <persName>Waka-no-
mae</persName> appeared as dancers. In the beginning the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign>
wore the "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">suikan</foreign>" or silk court robe and "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">tateboshi</foreign>" or
black court headdress, with a white dirk in their belt, when they
danced, and it was like the dancing of a man: but from the
middle age the headdress and sword were disused, and they
danced only in the white "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">suikan</foreign>," hence they were called
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign>.
</p>
<pb n="14" xml:id="p38-14"/>

<p>But among the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign> of the capital, when they heard
of the good fortune of <persName>Gio</persName>, there were some who hated her
and some who were envious. Those who envied her said:
"Ah! how fortunate is <persName>Gio Gozen</persName>, if we do even as she does
we too may become prosperous in like manner;" so they
added the syllable "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gi</foreign>" to their names to see if they too might
not obtain good luck. Some called themselves <persName>Giichi</persName>, <persName>Giji</persName>,
<persName>Gifuku</persName>, or <persName>Gitoku</persName>. Those who hated her said "Surely it is
not a matter of the name or character with which it is written,
fortune is the result of disposition inherited from a previous
existence;" and so few of them took such a name. Now it
came to pass that, three years afterwards, another skillful
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign> appeared; and she was a maiden sixteen years of
age, born in the province of <placeName>Kaga</placeName>, and her name was <persName>Hotoke</persName>.
And when the people of the capital, both high and low, saw
her, they said that although from of old times many <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyo-
shi</foreign> had been seen there, one so dexterous as she had not been
beheld; and she too was in exceeding great favour with all.
And in the course of time <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> said: "Though I have
made sport for the whole Empire, yet this great <persName>Taira</persName> minister
who now is the source of all fortune and prosperity has not yet
deigned to summon me; after the manner of entertainers I
will e'en go uninvited." So she forthwith proceeded to the
Palace in <placeName>Nishi-hachijo</placeName>. On her arrival, a servant entered the
presence of the minister and announced: "<persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName>, now
<pb n="15" xml:id="p39-15"/>

so famous in this city is without." Then the lay-priest grow
very angry and replied "How then! do not these players
attend only when they are called? Why is it that she has
come unbidden? Whether she be called God or Buddha,
(<persName>Hotoke</persName>) it is not suitable that she come here while <persName>Gio</persName> is
present. Bid her depart at once." <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> was already
retiring at these unkind words, when <persName>Gio</persName> said to the Minister
"It is surely the usual custom that players should attend
unbidden, and moreover it is because she is still young and
innocent that she has thus intruded on you—so it will be most
unkind to speak harshly and send her away—how greatly will
she be shamed and distressed by it; as I myself have trodden
the same path, I cannot but remember these things. If you
will not deign to allow her to dance or to sing, yield, I pray
you, so far as to call her back and receive her in audience:
if you then dismiss her, it will be a favour indeed worthy of her
deep gratitude." To this the Priest-Minister answered: "Since
you wish it to be so, I will see her and then dismiss her": and
he sent a servant to call her. <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName>, having been thus
harshly treated, was even then entering her carriage to return
when she was summoned and turned back again. The Minister
met her and granted her an audience. Thus <persName>Hotoke</persName>, though
it seemed unlikely that she would gain an audience, yet through
the kindness of <persName>Gio</persName>, who thus importuned for her, was not only
able to enter the Minister's presence, but further it happened
that he, wishing to hear her voice, directed that she should sing
a song of the kind called "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign>:" and thus she sang :
</p>
<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyɔshi</foreign>. Cf, <bibl><author>Sansom</author>, note on <title>Tsurezuregusa</title>. p. 128.</bibl> and for illus.
of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Suikan</foreign>, p. 127. <persName>Yoshida Kenko</persName> says here; '<persName>O-no-Hisasuke</persName> says that
<persName>Michinori no Nyudo</persName> selected certain dances that were amusing, and
taught a woman named <persName>Ise-no Zenji</persName> to dance them. She wore a white
robe, with a sword, and an <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">eboshi</foreign>, and thus they were called <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Otoko-mae</foreign>,
or men's dances. <persName>Zenji's</persName> daughter, who was called <persName>Shizuka</persName>, followed her
in this profession. This is the origin of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabyoshi</foreign>. They sang the
songs of Gods and Buddhas. Later <persName>Minamoto-no-Mitsuyuki</persName> composed a
great number of others, and there are also some that are the work of the
<persName>Emperor Go Toba</persName>, which His Majesty was pleased to teach to <persName>Kamegiku</persName>.

<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign>. A verse of eight or twelve lines of seven and five syllables:

<l>"When I first enjoyed the sight of your bountiful presence,</l>
<l>Twas like the evergreen pine, flourishing age after age.</l>
<l>Like to the pond on whose rocks is basking the turtle thrice blessed,</l>

</lg>
<pb n="16" xml:id="p40-16"/>

<p>And those who heard it were greatly wondering at her
skill and her beauty, and pressed her to repeat it even to three
times. The Lay-priest also was greatly diverted and said:
"Since you are so skilful at <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign> you must also be able to
dance well; we wish to see one of your dances." Then the
drums were ordered to be beaten and she danced forthwith.
Now <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> was renouned for the beauty of her hair
and features, and her voice was no less exquisite; how then
should she fail in the dance? So when she put forth all her
skill and charm in dancing, <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was enraptured and his
heart turned wholly toward her. But when <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName>
said to him: "Did I not present myself uninvited, and when
almost rejected was I not only brought back by the entreaty
of <persName>Gio Gozen</persName>? I pray thee grant me leave that I may return
quickly;" the lay-monk by no means agreed to the proposal,
and thinking that she was only embarrased because of the
presence of <persName>Gio</persName>, proposed to send <persName>Gio</persName> away.
</p>
<p>But <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> answered 'How can this be? If we
were to remain here both together, I should be most
embarrassed, and if your Excellency send away <persName>Gio Gozen</persName> and keep
me here alone, how ashamed will she not feel in her heart?
Indeed it will be most painful to her. If you deign to think of
me again in the future, I am always able to come at your
call. I beg that to-day I may be allowed to retire."
</p>
<p><persName>Kiyomori</persName>, seeing how the matter lay, straightway ordered
<persName>Gio</persName> to leave the Palace, and to that end sent a messenger three
times. Although <persName>Gio</persName> had expected this thing from long
before, she did not think that it would come to pass to-day or
to-morrow. But as the <persName>Nyudo</persName> continually repeated this
unreasonable demand, there was nothing for her but to sweep
her room clean and to go. Even those who meet under the
shade of the same tree, or who greet each other by the river
side, since it is owing to relations in a previous existence, ever
feel pain at parting with each other; how much more grievous
<pb n="17" xml:id="p41-17"/>

a thing it is, when two have been together in affection for the
space of three years. So in regret and grief she shed unavailing
tears. Thus as it was a thing that must be, <persName>Gio</persName> went forth, but
ere she went she wrote on the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> this verse, thinking to bring
perchance to remembrance the forgotten image of one who was
gone.
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"The fresh or fading flowers of the same moor,</l>
<l>In autumn meet with the same hapless fate."</l>
</lg>
<p>Then riding in a carriage to the place where she lived, she
cast hers If down within the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> and wept unceasingly. Her
mother and her younger sister, seeing these things, asked many
questions, but <persName>Gi</persName> would by no means give any answer, and
only by enquiring of her maid did they come to know what
had happened. Moreover the hundred <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koku</foreign> and hundred
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kwan</foreign> of monthly allowance ceased; it was now the turn of the
relations of <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> to taste the enjoyment of this
prosperity. Soon all the people of the capital heard of these
matters, and wondered if it were true that <persName>Gio</persName> had been
dismissed from the <placeName>Nishi-hachijo</placeName> palace. There were some who
went to see her, some who sent letters, and some who sent their
servants, but <persName>Gio</persName>, since she had no inclination to amuse anyone
now, did not even receive their letters, neither did she treat in
any way with the messengers. She became more and more
melancholy and only shed unavailing tears.
Thus the year
ended and the next spring came.
</p>
<p>Then the <persName>Nyudo</persName> sent a messenger to <persName>Gio</persName> asking after her
affairs and her health and saying that as <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> wished
for someɔne tɔ beguile her tedious hours, would she not come
up to the palace to dance, or it might be sing <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign>, and thus
cheer her, but <persName>Gio</persName> returned no answer, only she lay down and
restrained her tears. Again the <persName>Nyudo</persName> sent to know why she
did not go, and why at least she did not answer; if she would
not go, for what reason was it? For <persName>Jokai</persName> himself wished to
confer with her. When her mother heard this, weeping bitterly,
she thus admonished her; "Why at least do you not deign to
<pb n="18" xml:id="p42-18"/>

send an answer? and why do you not go when thus rebuked?"
At which <persName>Gio</persName> said, restraining her tears: "If I thought I
ought to go, I would answer, but since I shall by no
means go,
I know not what answer I can give. As I do
not go when I am thus summoned, he has somewhat to discuss
with me, he says; and what may this be but perchance to drive
me from the city, or it may be to take my life. Beyond these
two things no worse is possible. Even though one go forth
from <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, the way is not so sorrowful. Again if one is
called away from life, would one grudge this body so much?
Once having known the bitterness of being disliked, shall I look
on his face a second time?" Now when she did not feel it
necessary to reply, her mother again admonished her, weeping:
"Among those who dwell in this land, the commands of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> ought not to be disobeyed, and moreover the relation of
man and woman is from a former existence, it does not begin in
this life; even though the pledge be for a thousand or ten
thousand years, there are many that soon are parted, and
though some think that it will be but for a little while, yet it
may endure unto the end of life. The thing that has no
certainty in this life of ours is the relation between man and woman.
If you do not go now when you are summoned, it is not likely
that you will be put to death, but certainly we shall be driven
from <placeName>Miyako</placeName>. Even if you must leave the capital, you are
both still young, and whatever space there may be between the
rock and the tree it is easy to pass over; but I am old, and
when weak and declining, to go and live in a strange place,
is sad even to think of. Oh that I might be allowed to
live and die in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>!" Thus considering her filial duty
both in this life and the next, though <persName>Gio</persName> had determined
that she would not go, not disobedient to her mother she
stood ready to set out, bathed in tears; indeed her feelings were
very pitiable. As it would be lonely for her to go alone, her
younger sister, <persName>Ginyo</persName> prepared to accompany her, with two
other <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shirabycshi</foreign> beside, making in all a company of four. In
<pb n="19" xml:id="p43-19"/>

one carriage they rode together and came to the <placeName>Nishi-hachijo</placeName>
palace.
</p>
<p>On entering however, she was not called to take the seat
she had formerly occupied. a place much lower down being
provided for her. "Alas!" thought she, "how shall this be?
Although there is no fault in me, and although I have come
hither, how am I distressed in being given a lower seat." And
not knowing what to do, she said nothing to anyone, but her
tears fell plentifully from beneath the sleeve she pressed to her
face. When <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName> saw this, she was greatly affected
and said to <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, “It would have been better if you had
not sent for her; but now let her be called up hither, or if not,
suffer me to be dismissed and go away.”
</p>
<p>The <persName>Nyudo</persName> would not at all consider this and would not
permit her to go away, but by and by he deigned to receive
<persName>Gio</persName> and to greet her and enquire how she did, explaining that,
as <persName>Hot ke Gozen</persName> was lonely, it would be very pleasant if <persName>Gio</persName>
would comfort her by dancing and singing <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign>. <persName>Gio</persName>
replied, with difficulty suppressing her tears, "Indeed I came
wishing not to disobey your august command," and sang the
following verse of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign>:—
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Even Buddha himself was once an ordinary person,</l>
<l>I also at last like unto Buddha shall grow.</l>
<l>Everything on this earth can partake of the nature of</l>
<l>Buddha.</l>
<l>Only to be estranged, this is painful indeed."</l>
</lg>
<p>Twice she sang it, weeping bitterly, and as she sang all the
Princes and Courtiers of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and the high officers and
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> shed tears of admiration and sympathy. <persName>Kiyomori</persName>
also acknowledged the justice of her complaint and frankly
confessed it before them all.
</p>
<p>So when the dance was finished he intimated that, as at
present he had to attend to other matters, in future she should
come without any especial summons to dance and sing and
<pb n="20" xml:id="p44-20"/>

amuse <persName>Hotoke</persName>. But <persName>Gio</persName>, repressing her tears, went forth
without returning any answer.
</p>
<p>Thus <persName>Gio</persName>, not having intended to go, but thinking it cruel
to disobey her mother, a second time suffered ignominious
treatment. How pitiable it was indeed! Then thinking that if
she remained in this world, she was always liable to meet with
such afflictions, she determined to put an end to her life. Her
sister <persName>Ginyo</persName>, hearing this, also made up her mind to die with her.
Then their mother, being aware of their resolve, again with
tears more gravely admonished them. "If you have
determined to do this, how greatly do I regret that I persuaded you
to go; for in truth your chagrin is the cause of this, and if you
Indeed take your own life and your sister follow you, you my
two daughters thus dying first, what profit is it to me your
n.other, who am aged and declining, if I still live on? I too with
you will cast away my life. Now to cause one's mother, who
has not yet attained the limit of her years to cast her life away,
is it not even as one of the five great sins? This life is but a
temporary abiding place, shame upon shame even, what is it to
be accounted? There is only sadness of heart in the long
darkness of this world. If in this life we become attached to
things, in the next life we must tread an evil way in sadness."
Thus melted in tears she persuaded them. <persName>Gio</persName>, also weeping,
admitted that she spoke truth; doubtless it was as one of the
five great sins that, because of regret at being put to shame, she
should determine to put an end to her life. So it was that she
gave up her intention of dying by her own hand: but since if
she should stay in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> she would still be liable to
humiliation, <persName>Gio</persName>, at the age of only one and twenty, deserted the
capital and became a nun. In a mountain village in the
recesses of <placeName>Saga</placeName>, building herself a hut of brushwood, she
continually murmured her invocations to Buddha. When her

<p>sister <persName>Ginyo</persName> perceived that she did thus, having made compact
to die with her, how much more when the world has become so
hateful shall she not at least accompany her sister. So at the
age of nineteen she changed her condition, and retiring from the
world with her elder sister, devoted herelf to prayers for their
future happiness. Then their mother, seeing that she was left
alone, aged, grey-haired and feeble, since her two young
daughters had forsaken the world, despairing of any future
happiness, at the age of forty-five shaved her head; earnestly
giving herself up to prayer to Buddha, with her two daughters
she sought a happier birth in future.
</p>
<p>Thus the spring passed by and the summer grew late; the
first winds of autumn began to blow. Gazing at the Milky
Way where the lover stars meet in the heavens, when verses are
accustomed to be traced on the leaves of the "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kaji</foreign>," watching
the evening sun hide herself behind the ridge of the western
hills, they likened the sun-set to the Pure Land of the West,
wondering when they should be reborn in that blessed region
and with all desire extinguished abide there for ever. Thus
they continued to meditate on their sad condition, their tears
alone being inexhaustible. But one evening when twilight was
passing into darkness they had shut their latticed door of
bamboo and lighted their dimly burning lamp, and mother and
daughters together were repeating the "<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign>" when there
came a knocking on the lattice. The three nuns were at once
overcome by fear : "Ah! perchance it is some goblin who has
come to disturb our prayers and make our Nembutsu of no
avail. For what human being will approach such a brushwood
hut as this by night to which none comes even by day?" Such
<pb n="22" xml:id="p46-22"/>

a slight bamboo gate as this, even if we shut it, is easy to break
through, therefore let us open it without delay. If indeed it
be a pitiless one who will deprive us of life, relying on the
True Vow of <persName>Amida</persName> on whom till now we have called, if we
ceaselessly repeat the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign>, surely the Buddha and the
attendant <persName>Bosatsu</persName> hearing our voice will come and meet us,
leading us safely to the Paradise of the West." Thus earnestly
repeating the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign>, admonishing each others' hearts and
holding each the hand of the other, they opened wide the
bamboo lattice.

<p>But behold it was no evil spirit but only <persName>Hotoke Gozen</persName>
that stood outside. While <persName>Gio</persName> was enquiring how <persName>Hotoke
Gozen</persName> had come to visit them, whether in a dream or in her
actual person, <persName>Hotoke</persName> answered amid her tears. "It is a strange
thing to speak of what has happened,;but if I speak it not,
perhaps I may not be remembered. So I will relate all things as
they were from the beginning in detail. When first I came to
the Court uninvited and was about to go away disappointed
after being dismissed, it was at your request that I was
called back again; but a woman is a person not to be relied on,
so that, not obeying my own conscience, I allowed you to be
sent away and even stayed myself in your stead. Now in
consequence of this I am overwhelmed with shame and
conscience stricken. When I saw you go away I felt it to be
through my fault and could not feel at all happy. Moreover
when I saw the lines written by your hand on the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign>, “In
autumn meet with the same hapless fate," I thought it was
indeed true. And then when you were once more summoned
and when you recited the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign> verse, the whole matter came
to my mind again. But as I did not know where you were, I
enquired and heard that you were together in a certain place
absorbed in prayer and meditation. Then indeed I felt envious
of you, and having zealously begged my freedom since the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> has no further need of me, when I thought attentively
about the matter, the glory of this <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shaba-world</foreign> is a dream of a
<pb n="23" xml:id="p47-23"/>

dream—pleasure and prosperity, of what value are they? Very
difficult it is to receive a body and to obtain the mercy of the
Buddha. If now I go down in sorrow to the underworld
I am unable to obtain rebirth in another life; yea how difficult
will it be to rise up again. In a world of uncertainty for both
old and young how can we rely on our youth? The day when
the breath enters our body or goes forth we cannot know; our
life is more fleeting than gossamer or a flash of lightning; if we
boast of the glory that endures for a moment, loss of happiness
in the future life must be our portion. So this morning stealing
out unperceived, I have come hither as you see, putting away
my ordinary dress to become a recluse; thus having changed
my condition, I entreat that you will condescend to pardon my
former trespass, that together repeating the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign> we may
sit on one lotus in Paradise together. But if I can not attain my
desire, I will wander away whither I know not, falling down
under some tree or on some mossy bank, and ever zealously
repeating the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign>, I will strive to attain rebirth in
Paradise."
</p>
<p>So pressing her sleeve to her face she entreated them. <persName>Gio</persName>
answered her, scarce withholding her tears:—"Not even in a
dream did I imagine that you would think thus, while I lived
according to the custom of this fleeting world; when I thought
of the unhappiness of my condition, often I felt resentment at
your conduct in spite of myself, thus suffering loss in this life
and the next. But as now you have changed your condition,
your former faults have passed away like the dew of morning.
Now do I feel extreme happiness knowing that you will without
doubt attain your desire and be reborn in bliss. If people may
say that my having become a nun was a difficult thing, shall I
too so consider it?. It was because I hated this world and
wished to put an end to my life that I did this. But that you,
having no resentment or sorrow, and being now but seventeen
years old, should thus despise this world and so earnestly set
your mind on the Pure Land, thinking only of the Noble
<pb n="24" xml:id="p48-24"/>

Path, what a happy state of virtuous enlightenment is this
indeed!"
</p>
<p>So the four of them retired from the world together,
morning and evening offering flowers and incense before
Buddha's shrine, and with one mind fervently pouring out their
petitions; each one sooner or later obtaining her desire for
rebirth in bliss. And in the register of the temple <placeName>Cho-ko-do</placeName>
built by the <persName>Ho-o Go-Shirakawa</persName> the honourable spirits of the
four are found enshrined. Indeed it is a very marvellous thing.

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>TWICE AN EMPRESS.</head>
<p>From ancient times to the present day, since the families of
<orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName> were both called in to assist in the government, if
there were any who, making light of the constitution of the
land, did not obey the Imperial laws, they were corrected by
the other party, and thus any disorder was prevented. But
after <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> was killed in <placeName>Hogan</placeName> and <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> in <placeName>Heiji</placeName>,
some of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> went into exile and others lost their lives, so
that now only the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were flourishing and no one else dare
raise his head; and it seemed as if this state of things would last
for ever.
</p>
<p>But after the death of the <persName>Retired Emperor Toba</persName>
wars ensued, and murders, banishments, vacant offices and
suspensions were continually occurring, so that the whole
country was disquieted and society was not able to rest in peace.
Especially from the period <placeName>Ei-ryaku</placeName> and <placeName>O-ho</placeName> when some
personal retainers of the Retired Emperor were punished by the
Imperial Court and conversely some of those of the Imperial
Court were chastised by the Retired Emperor; so that high and
low were afraid, and no one felt at case, but all were as though
looking into a deep pool or walking on thin ice. And the
relations between the Emperor and the Retired Emperor,
however estranged they might be, were remarkable for their
extraordinary circumstances. According to the way of a
<pb n="25" xml:id="p49-25"/>

degenerate age like this, people tried to anticipate each other in
cunning. Though the Emperor was continually contradicting
the orders of the Retired Emperor, yet one thing especially
there was that caused great astonishment to all, and many found
fault with his Majesty: it was as follows:—The Consort of the
late <persName>Retired Emperor Konoe</persName>, who was entitled to be styled
<persName>Taiko-tai-kogu</persName> or Grandmother of the Emperor, was the
daughter of <persName>Prince Kinyoshi</persName> the <persName>Udaijin of Oi-no-mikado</persName>.
After the former Emperor had pre-deceased her she moved to
the detached palace of <placeName>Konoe</placeName>, called <placeName>Kawahara</placeName>, outside the
Court precincts, and about the period <placeName>Ei-ryaku</placeName>, having come to
the age of about two or three and twenty, she was a little past
her prime. But as she still had the reputation of being the first
beauty in the land, the Emperor fell deeply in love with her
and secretly ordered several of the bravest of his retainers to go
to the detached palace, and privately sent love letters to her.
She however, did not presume to assent to his August suit. So
straightway showing his affection openly, His Majesty deigned to
intimate to the <persName>Udaijin's</persName> family that he wished to bring her into
the Palace as official Empress. Now as this was a decree
unprecedented in the country, the courtiers took counsel
together about it, and all uttered different opinions. There is, it
must be regretfully admitted, an example in a foreign country,
in that of <persName>Soku-ten Kogo</persName> of <placeName>China</placeName>, the Consort of <persName>Taiso</persName> of <placeName>To</placeName>,
and thus step-mother of the <persName>Emperor Ko-so</persName>, who after the death
of <persName>Taiso</persName> became the Consort of <persName>Koso</persName>. This having happened
in a foreign country is a different matter, but in our country
from the time of <persName>Jimmu Tenno</persName>, in all the seventy or more
generations of mortal Emperors we have heard of no such thing
as becoming Empress for the second time. The courtiers
having expressed their decision unanimously, the Retired
Emperor declared to the Emperor that this thing must not be :
but His Majesty answered: "The Emperor has neither father
<pb n="26" xml:id="p50-26"/>

nor mother; We sit on the Jewel Throne by merit of the Ten
Virtues. Such a thing as this must be entrusted to the Imperial
Will."
</p>
<note type="footnote">Retired Emperor. <persName>Go-Shirakawa Ho-o</persName>. The Emperor at this time
was <persName>Nijo Tenno</persName>.</note>
<note type="footnote">Ten Virtues. In Buddhism, not committing the ten wicked deeds, i.e.
killing, theft, adultery, lying, exaggeration, abuse, ambiguous talk,
covetousness, malice and unbelief. The expression "Emperor of Ten
Virtues" is to be explained by the saying that one who accumulated
merit by practising the ten virtues may be reborn as an Emperor in his
future existence. The Emperor is unique and has not the limitations of
ordinary people.</note>
<p>As the date of the official entry of the new Empress was
soon communicated by Imperial Edict, the Retired Emperor
could do nothing more. When the lady heard it she was
overcome by tears. "If" she said "I had not out-lived my
former Lord, but at the beginning of the autumn of the period
<placeName>Kyu-ju</placeName> I had terminated my dew-like existence with his, or if I
had become a nun and retired from the world, I should not
have had to hear such unhappy tidings." But the Minister her
father spoke as follows: "One who resists the Emperor's will
is no more than a madman; already the Imperial Edict has been
published, so there is nothing more to be said; only you must
go quickly. If a Prince should be born you will be styled
"<persName>Kokubo</persName>," Mother of the country, and I too shall become the
grandfather of an Emperor; truly an auspicious thing. If thus
you will help your father it will be indeed an extremely filial
act." To these words the Empress Dowager made no answer.
Somehow or other in the course of her writing practise she
had written this verse:
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Better by far it had been to have died when in my
bereavement;</l>
<l>Than to live on and hand down a name unexampled
like this."</l>
</lg>
<p>How this thing will be published in the world, a pitiful and
sad case will people consider it!
</p>
<p>Soon the day for the State Entry into the Palace arrived.
<pb n="27" xml:id="p51-27"/>

The Minister her father and the Courtiers attendant on the
Emperor hastened on the ceremony of departure from the
Palace with all speed, but as she was very reluctant, evening
came on and she had not yet started. Thus it was past midnight
when she entered her carriage. After making her State Entry
into the Palace she was conducted into the <placeName>Reikei-den</placeName>, and then
straightway assisted in the morning ceremony of government
administration. In the Imperial apartments of the <placeName>Shishin-den</placeName>
were the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> painted with the figures of the Chinese Sages
<persName>I-in</persName>, <persName>Tei-ko-rin</persName>, <persName>Gu-sei-nan</persName>, <persName>Tai-ko-bo</persName>, <persName>Ro-ku-ri Sensei</persName>, <persName>Riseki</persName>
and <persName>Shi-ba</persName>. There were also <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> with paintings of long-armed
people, long-legged people, and horses. The <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Oni-no-ma</foreign>, or
Devil's Room, had <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> painted with a lifelike figure of the
Chinese general <persName>Ri</persName>. There is reason to suppose that the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign>
of the seven Sages were painted by <persName>Owari-no-kami Ono-no-Tofu</persName>.
Moreover is it not among the paintings of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> of the
<placeName>Sei-ryo-den</placeName> that there is to be seen one by <persName>Kanaoka</persName> of the
moon at down on the distant hills? When the <persName>retired Emperor
Konoe</persName> was a child, he had in the course of his play made some
marks on the paper, and when his former consort looked, they
were there all unchanged: and she thought fondly of his
memory and made this verse:
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Ah! to think of the sorrows that now have fallen upon me;</l>
<l>When I look at the moon, living again in the Court."</l>
</lg>
<p>And during this second intimacy with the Emperor her
unspeakable sadness affected her so much that she fell sick.

<head>THE QUARREL ABOUT THE TABLETS.</head>
<p>Now about the spring of the first year of <placeName>Ei-man</placeName>, His
Augustness the Mikado fell sick, and in the beginning of the
<pb n="28" xml:id="p52-28"/>

summer of the same year his disease became exceedingly severe.
Now the daughter of the Minister of the Treasury, <persName>Iki-no-Kane-
mori</persName> had a son by His Majesty who was two years old, and it
was expected that he would be made Crown Prince; but on the
twenty fifth of June scarcely had a decree been published
appointing him Crown Prince than he was immediately that
same night placed on the Throne: whereat everyone was
much astonished. Those learned in such matters said that if
investigation be made into the Imperial Line, <persName>Seiwa Tenno</persName>
inherited the Throne of <persName>Montoku Tenno</persName> at the age of nine: at
this time <persName>Chu-jin Ko</persName> (<persName>Fujiwara Yoshifusa</persName>) assisted his young
Lord in the government, just as in <placeName>China</placeName> <persName>Shu-kodan</persName>
administered all the affairs of state in behalf of <persName>Sei-O</persName>, and this was the
beginning of the office of <persName>Sessho</persName> (Regent).
</p>
<p><persName>Toba-in</persName> came to the Throne at five and <persName>Konoe-in</persName> at three
years of age, but even if these be quoted, the present Prince was
only two years old: still even if without precedent, it is foolish
to be disturbed about it. On the 27th, of July of the same year
the Retired Emperor departed this life at the age of twenty two
like the untimely falling of a flower in bud, and within the
Jewel Curtain and the Brocade Vail all were choked with tears.
That same night he was borne to <placeName>Funa-oka Yama</placeName> behind
<placeName>Rendai-no</placeName> to the North East of the <placeName>Temple of Ko-ryu-ji</placeName>. After
the August Obsequies, many priests from the <placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName> temple
of <placeName>Hiei-san</placeName> and the <placeName>Ko-fuku-ji</placeName> at <placeName>Nara</placeName> came to blows about the
question of putting up their tablets.

<p>It was the custom after the death of an Emperor that he
should be borne to the place of burial attended by the monks
of the South and North Capitals, (<placeName>Nara</placeName> and <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>,) and as they
went in procession round the tomb, they put up the tablets of
their repective temples. When there was no temple endowed
<pb n="29" xml:id="p53-29"/>

by <persName>Shomu Tenno</persName> to dispute it, the tablet of <placeName>To-dai-ji</placeName> was put
up, and next came that of <placeName>Ko-fuku-ji</placeName> founded by <persName>Tan-kai-Ko</persName>. Of
the Northern Capital, opposite to that of <placeName>Kofuku-ji</placeName> the tablet of
<placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName> was to be put up, after that the tablet of <placeName>En-jo-ji</placeName>, the
foundation of <persName>Tem-mu Tenno</persName> begun by <persName>Chisho Daishi</persName>. But on
this occasion the priests of <placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName>, respecting what
precedent I know not, fixed up the tablet of their temple after that of
<placeName>To-dai-ji</placeName> and before that of <placeName>Ko-fuku-ji</placeName>, and while the priests of
the South Capital were taking counsel with one another what
they should do, there stood forth two very worthless priests of
the <placeName>Sai-kon-do</placeName> of <placeName>Ko-fuku-ji</placeName>, called <persName>Kwannon-bo</persName> and <persName>Sei-shi-bo</persName>;
<persName>Kwannon-bo</persName> was attired in a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hara-maki</foreign>, or body armour, corded
with black silk, and held a white hilted <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">naga-maki</foreign> or short
halberd, grasped in both hands; <persName>Sei-shi-bo</persName> was in armour laced
with green thread and carried a huge <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">tachi</foreign> in a black lacquered
scabbard. Both of these ran up, and cutting down the tablet
of <placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName>, broke it in pieces and threw them hither and

<head>THE CONFLAGRATION AT KIYOMIZU.</head>
<p>Now the faction of <placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName>, in the matter of resisting
the violence that had been done, very carefully watched for an
occasion, but said no word. After the decease of the Mikado
everything, even the trees and flowers, was grief-stricken and of
sorrowful appearance, and after this undignified wrangle, all,
high and low, dispersed to the four quarters crestfallen and
<pb n="30" xml:id="p54-30"/>

abashed. On the same 29th, day, at the hour of the Horse,
hearing that a great company of the priests of <placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName> was
going down to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, <persName>Bushi</persName> and <persName>Kebi-ishi</persName> went out to <placeName>Nishi
Sakamoto</placeName> to prevent them, but in spite of this they burst
through, and a great tumult arose.
Then the <persName>Retired Emperor
Go-Shirakawa</persName>, how it happened is not certain, sent orders to the
<placeName>En-ryaku-ji</placeName> faction, and, thinking that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were to be
attacked, sent soldiers to the Palace to strengthen all the guard
houses for protection. The <persName>Heike</persName> all gathered together at
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, and the Retired Emperor also betook himself thither
in haste. <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was at that time only <persName>Dainagon no Udai-
sho</persName>, and was in a very great state of agitation. <persName>Komatsu dono</persName>,
wondering what all the matter was about, tried to pacify them,
but there was much tumult and reviling among the soldiers.
The monks of <placeName>Hiei-san</placeName> did not go to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, but casually
proceeded to press on to <placeName>Kiyomizu</placeName>, where they burned all the
temple buildings and monastery. This was to revenge the
insult they had received on the night of the Imperial Funeral ;
since <placeName>Kiyomizu</placeName> was a branch temple of <placeName>Ko-fuku-ji</placeName>. The day
after their burning <placeName>Kiyomizu</placeName>, they wrote the text: "By
<persName>Kwannon's</persName> aid the cave of fire will become a lake," and affixed
it to the great gate, but the next day another tablet was
substituted bearing the text "Her wondrous power is without
equal for all ages." When the crowd returned, the Retired
Emperor came back hurriedly from <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, and <persName>Shigemori
Kyo</persName> alone went to meet him.
</p>
<p>The Chancellor his father did not go; this was out of
precaution. When <persName>Shigemori</persName> returned his father the <persName>Dainagon</persName> spoke
thus to him: "I am rather afraid of this visit of the <persName>Retired Em-
peror</persName>; he has been thinking of doing something or other, and
sometimes he has even expressed it, and for that reason be has
come, so I cannot altogether rid my mind of suspicion." You

the <title>Hokke-Kyo</title>. By faith in <persName>Kwannon</persName> even the most difficult things can

<pb n="31" xml:id="p55-31"/>

<p>must not show any such suspicion either in word or deed,"
replied <persName>Shigemori</persName>," it is not a good thing to reveal one's thoughts
to people. You must submit entirely to the will of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. It
you show sympathy you may secure the protection of both
'<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kami</foreign>' and '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Hotoke</foreign>'. If you do thus there will be no need
to fear about your person." "Indeed <persName>Shigemori</persName> is most
generous," said his father.
</p>
<p>When the <persName>Ho-o</persName> returned, those retainers who were most
intimate with him remarked: "What a strange thing is this
that is said! The <persName>Ho-o</persName> has not the least idea of such a thing."
Now a man of influence in the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Palace named <persName>Saiko
Hoshi</persName> was there at this time, and he came forward and said:
"Heaven alone cannot say anything, man must say it. The
<persName>Heike</persName> have now exceeding great power and I think it is
Heaven's will that someone should protest." But the others
said one to another : "This is not a good thing to say. Walls
have ears. Take care!" whispering in trepidation. Now as this
year was a year of mourning, the ceremonies of '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gokei</foreign>'
(purification of the new Emperor), and <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Daishoei</foreign> (presentation
of new rice to the Imperial Ancestors) were not performed.
</p>
<p>Now <persName>Ken-shun-mon-in</persName>, while yet she was called <persName>Higashi-no-Onkata</persName>, had conceived a son by the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, and this Prince
was now five years old and there was a rumour that he was to
be nominated Crown Prince. So it was that on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month he was suddenly given the title
of <persName>Shinno</persName>. On the advent of the New Year the era was
changed to <placeName>Nin-an</placeName>. On the eighth day of the tenth month of
the same year the Prince who had been raised to be <persName>Shinno</persName> the
year before was proclaimed Crown Prince at <placeName>Higashi Sanjo</placeName>
Palace. Thus the Crown Prince was an uncle of six years old,
and the Emperor was his nephew three years old, their relation
and age being quite abnormal and improper. Yet in the second
year of <placeName>Kwan-wa</placeName> <persName>Ichijo</persName> had become Emperor at the age of
seven and <persName>Sanjo</persName> Crown Prince at eleven; it was, therefore not
without precedent. The Emperor (<persName>Rokujo</persName>) had come to the
<pb n="32" xml:id="p56-32"/>

throne at two years old and was dethroned when barely five,
becoming a priest on the 19th day of the second month and
taking the title of <persName>Shin-in</persName> before he had attained the age of
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Genpuku</foreign>. Both in <placeName>China</placeName> and in our own country this is the
first time that such a thing has happened. On the twentieth day
of the third month of the third year of <placeName>Nin-an</placeName>, the new Emperor
was enthroned in the <placeName>Daikyoku-den</placeName>. When this Emperor came
to the throne the fortunes of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family stood at their zenith,
for his mother <persName>Kenshun-mon-in</persName> was the younger sister of <persName>Hachijo-no-Ni-i Dono</persName> the wife of the Lay-priest Chancellor, while <persName>Taira
Dainagon Tokitada</persName> was her elder brother and so the Imperial
Uncle, so that he assumed the position of Regent in matters
both within and without the Court, all appointments of officials
both in spring and autumn being in his hands alone. His
position was just like that of <persName>Yokoku-chu</persName>, while his younger
sister <persName>Yokihi</persName> was the favourite of the Emperor of <placeName>China</placeName>. How
very enviable was his prosperity and popularity. As the <persName>Nyudo</persName>
consulted him about all political matters both great and small,
the people of the time called him <persName>Hei-Kwampaku</persName>. (i.e.
responsible to <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, not, as usual, to the Emperor.)

<head>A COLLISION OF GRANDEES.</head>
<p>On the sixteenth day of the seventh month of the first year
of <placeName>Ka-o</placeName> the <persName>Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa</persName> became a priest,
but as, even after this, he continued to direct the administration
as before, there was no difference between the Retired Emperor
and the Reigning one: so that the Courtiers of the Retired
Emperor and the Military Guards (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Hoku-men</foreign>) of both upper
and lower ranks received rank and emolument in abundance.
<pb n="33" xml:id="p57-33"/>

Still, as is the way of man's heart, they were not contented, but
would say to their intimate friends when they met ;
</p>
<p>"Ah, if that man loses his position then that demesne will
be vacant; or if that fellow could be done away with, then I
should get his office." The <persName>Ho-o</persName> himself murmured in secret;
"From of old there have been many who have subdued the
enemies of the country, but never before have they been so
rewarded. When <persName>Sadamori</persName> defeated <persName>Masakado</persName> and when <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName> put
down <persName>Sadato</persName> and <persName>Muneto</persName>, when <persName>Yoshihide</persName> conquered <persName>Takehira</persName>
<persName>Yoshihide</persName> and <persName>Iehira</persName> a reward was given them, but it was
nothing more than a demesne; so that this arbitrary conduct in
rewarding them is not according to reason. This is because the
times are degenerate, and the principle of monarchic government
is no longer observed." He could find no opportunity to utter
any open reproof however. The <persName>Heike</persName>, on the other hand,
bore no special ill-will to the Imperial House.
</p>
<p>The primary cause of all the disturbance that was to follow
was that on the sixteenth day of the tenth month of the second
year of <placeName>Ka-o</placeName>, <persName>Shinsammi no Chujo Sukemori</persName>, second son of
<persName>Komatsu dono</persName>, a young man of thirteen years old who was
then <persName>Echizen-no-kami</persName>, wishing to see the beauties of the snow
scenery at <placeName>Karino</placeName>, the snow having fallen in patches here and
there, went out with a train of thirty youthful retainers on
horseback to <placeName>Rendaino</placeName>, <placeName>Murasakino</placeName> and <placeName>Ukon-no-baba</placeName>, and
flew many hawks at the quails and skylarks from morning till
evening, returning to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> about twilight. Now just at
this time the <persName>Sessho Motofusa</persName> was proceeding from the Palace
of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> at <placeName>Higashi-no-do</placeName> to the Imperial Palace, and going to
enter at the <placeName>Yuho</placeName> gate, he went southward from <placeName>Higashi-no-do</placeName>,
and turned to the East at <placeName>Oi-no-Mikado</placeName>, so that <persName>Sukemori</persName> met
him face to face between <placeName>Oi-no-Mikado</placeName> and <placeName>I-no-kuma</placeName>. Im-
mediately the Minister's retainers shouted peremptorily," Who
goes there? Dismount! Dismount! It is His Excellency who
passes!" But <persName>Sukemori</persName>, being too proud and careless of his
behaviour, his retainers too being all youths of under twenty
<pb n="34" xml:id="p58-34"/>

who understood little of courtesy, spite of it being a Minister
who passed, did not dismount according to custom, as etiquette
demanded: on the contrary they threatened to break through
his train. As it was dark perchance the Minister's retainers
were not aware that it was <persName>Kiyomori's</persName> grandson, or if they were
they made as if they were not, but anyhow they pulled <persName>Sukemori</persName>
and all his retainers from off their horses and put them to
exceeding shame. <persName>Sukemori</persName> could do nothing but make his
way back to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and relate all these circumstances to his
grandfather the Lay-priest Chancellor. The <persName>Nyudo</persName> was
extremely wrath; "Even a Minister," he said, "must respect
my family, and it is a most hateful thing that he should insult
such a young man; for a thing like this our house may be
despised. Thus I cannot help letting the Minister know these
things and indeed I hope to make him rue it." But <persName>Shigemori</persName>
said; "We are not affected by such a thing; if we be mocked
by men like <persName>Yorimasa</persName> or <persName>Mitsumoto</persName> of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, then we should
indeed be put to shame, but it was exceedingly discourteous of
my son not to alight when he met the Minister." Then he
called the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who had been in attendance during the
incident and said; "From henceforth take great care lest you
should by mistake insult a Minister." But afterwards the
<persName>Nyudo</persName>, without saying anything to <persName>Komatsu dono</persName>, collected
about sixty men, led by <persName>Namba</persName> and <persName>Seno</persName>, all rustic <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> of
exceeding bad manners who heeded nothing except the
commands of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, and bade them go and wait for the
Minister when he went out on the twenty-first day, and cut off
the front hair of his outriders and retainers as a revenge for the
insult to <persName>Sukemori</persName>. The <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> respectfully assented, and
went forth. The Minister, never dreaming of such a thing, went
out with more state than usual, owing to his having to stay in
the apartments of the <persName>Sessho</persName> to fix the time for the Emperor's
coming of age ceremonies, (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gempuku</foreign>, Assuming the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kammuri</foreign>,
<pb n="35" xml:id="p59-35"/>

and Reception of Officials) to be held next year. On this
occasion he had to enter by the <placeName>Taikenmon</placeName>, and as he was
going to the west of <placeName>Naka-no-mikado</placeName>, at <placeName>Inokuma</placeName> near <placeName>Horikawa</placeName>,
he met about three hundred retainers of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> all armed to
the teeth, who surrounded him on all sides with shouts of
exultation: then, chasing his retainers and outriders this way and
that, they treated them with contumely and cut off their front
hair. Among his sixteen retainers, <persName>Takemoto</persName>, a retainer of the
<persName>Udaijin</persName> also had his hair cut off. When they cut off the top-knot
of <persName>To Kurando-no-Taiyu Takanori</persName> they said; "You must not
consider this as your own top-knot but as though it were your
master's."
</p>
<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kammuri</foreign>. Ceremonial head-dress worn by Emperor and Nobles.</note>
<p>Then poking the ends of their bows into the car, they
broke the curtains, cut the harness and trappings off the oxen
and drove them hither and thither, finally returning to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>
with shouts of glee, whereupon the <persName>Nyudo</persName> praised them for
carrying out his orders so well. But the two retainers who rode
next to the Minister's car, <persName>Inaba-no-Saizukai</persName> and <persName>Toba-no-Kuni-
hisa Maro</persName>, though of quite low rank were very shrewd fellows,
and putting the car in order again they brought their master to
the palace of <placeName>Naka-no-Mikado</placeName>. He, wiping away his tears with
the sleeves of his dress of ceremony, returned home again in a
truly pitiful state. It is not necessary to speak of <persName>Kamatari</persName> and
<persName>Fuhito</persName> of the <persName>Fujiwara</persName> house, but since the time of <persName>Yoshifusa</persName>
and <persName>Mototsune</persName> to this day no such insult as this outrage of the
<persName>Heike</persName> has ever been known to befall a <persName>Sessho-Kwampaku</persName>.
</p>
<p>When <persName>Komatsu dono</persName> heard of it he was greatly disturbed
in his mind, and all the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who had taken part in it were
dismissed from their posts. "However strange a thing the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> ordered you to do, why did you tell me nothing of it,"
he said, "this is <persName>Sukemori's</persName> fault: the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Sendan</foreign> is fragrant even
from the time when it has but two leaves; so even a boy of
twelve or thirteen years knows what courtesy is and ought to
<pb n="36" xml:id="p60-36"/>

practise it. He is guilty of unfilial conduct in bringing the name
of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> into disrepute by such ill manners and must bear
the responsibility." So <persName>Shigemori</persName> removed him to <placeName>Ise-no-kuni</placeName>
as a discipline. He was indeed a leader to be admired both by
lord and vassal.

<head>SHISHI-NO-TANI.</head>
<p>Owing to this incident the Emperor's <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gempuku</foreign> was
postponed to the twenty fifth day of the same month, and was fixed
to take place at the Palace of the Retired Emperor, and as the
<persName>Sessho's</persName> presence would be then required, he received an Im-
perial communication appointing him <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> on the
fourteenth day. Soon after, on the seventeenth day, he paid a visit
of thanks to the Retired Emperor, but still the condition of
things generally seemed unsettled.
</p>
<p>Thus this year ended and the third year of <placeName>Ka-o</placeName> began.
On the fifth day of the first month the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gempuku</foreign> of the Emperor
took place, and on the thirteenth day he visited the Retired
Emperor in state. The <persName>Ho-o</persName> and his Consort received him:
His Majesty looked splendid indeed wearing the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kammuri</foreign> for
the first time. As Imperial Gonsort he received one of the
daughters of the Lay-priest Chancellor, and at the age of fifteen
he was adopted as step-son by the <persName>Ho-o</persName>.
</p>
<p>Now <persName>Myo-on-in-den</persName>, (<persName>Fujiwara Moronaga</persName>) was still at this
time <persName>Naidaijin-no-Sadaisho</persName>, and on his resigning this office, one
<persName>Tokudaiji-no-Dainagon Jittei-no-Kyo</persName> aspired to it in his stead;
<persName>Kwazan-in-no-Chunagon Kanemasa-no-Kyo</persName> also wished for it;
and <persName>Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName>, the third son of the late
<persName>Naka-no-Mikado To-Chunagon Kasei-no-Kyo</persName> also greatly
desired it. This <persName>Dainagon</persName>, being high in favour with the Retired
Emperor, began to offer many prayers for it. He stationed an
<pb n="37" xml:id="p61-37"/>

hundred priests before the shrine of <persName>Hachiman</persName> to read the
<title>Dai-Hannya Kyo</title> from beginning to end for seven days, and
while this was taking place, three doves flew forth from <placeName>Otoko-
yama</placeName> to the <persName>Tachibana</persName> tree which was before <persName>Koura Daimyojin</persName>
and fought one another to the death. Now doves are the well
known messengers of <persName>Hachiman Dai-Bosatsu</persName>, and in a shrine or
temple such a thing was an extraordinary portent. The <persName>Kengyo</persName>
of that time, <persName>Kyosei-hoin</persName> by name, reported it to the Imperial
Court. This was no ordinary matter, so the omens must be
consulted, and a soothsayer among the Shinto priests, on being
referred to spake thus; "This is a portent of great weight, but it
is not one that concerns the Emperor, but one of his subjects."
Then the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, not at all perturbed thereat, since in the
daytime people would see him, went out every night from his
Palace at <placeName>Naka-no-Mikado Karasu Maru</placeName> to the shrine of <placeName>Kamo</placeName>
on foot seven nights in succession. On the last night of the
seven, on his arriving home again tired out, he fell asleep for a
short time and dreamed that he went to the shrine of <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and
opened the door of the Holy of Holies, whereupon a very
majestic voice sounded forth with these words; "O cherry
flowers, do not hate the river breeze of <placeName>Kamo</placeName>, for it will not
stop the flowers falling." Then the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, not at all afraid,
set up an altar in a hollow cedar tree behind the sanctuary of
the <placeName>Yashiro</placeName> of <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and put there a saintly priest and had
prayers offered according to the <persName>Dakini</persName> rite for a hundred days.
Then it happened that suddenly the sky clouded over and it
thundered exceedingly, a thunderbolt striking the great cedar-tree and setting fire to it so that the shrine seemed in danger.
<pb n="38" xml:id="p62-38"/>

All the priests ran together to put it out, moreover they wished
to drive out the holy priest who was praying there, but he said;
"I intend to stay praying in this shrine for a hundred days, and
it is now the seventy fifth day, so I cannot depart now," and he
did not move. This was reported by the Shrine to the Imperial
Palace, but the Emperor bade them do nothing that was not in
accordance with the law. Then the priests took white rods in
their hands and struck the holy priest on the neck so that at
last they drove him out from the street <placeName>Ichijo</placeName> to the southward.
The gods do not accept discourtesy, and this <persName>Dainagon</persName> had
wished to become <persName>Taisho</persName>, a thing quite unsuitable to his rank,
hence this strange happening. Now at this time the appointment
of officials was not in accordance with the will of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, nor
with that of the <persName>Sessho-Kwampaku</persName>, but lay solely in the power
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. Even <persName>Tokudaiji Kwazan-in</persName> did not get this
office, but <persName>Komatsu Dono Shigemori</persName>, the eldest son of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName>, who was then <persName>Dainagon-no-Udaisho</persName>, changed over to
<persName>Sadaisho</persName>, while the second son <persName>Munemori</persName>, who was <persName>Chunagon</persName>,
passing over the heads of others his superiors, became <persName>Udaisho</persName>
in his stead. It is quite needless to say that <persName>Tokudaiji Dono</persName>,
who was a <persName>Dainagon</persName> of high lineage and of distinguished
literary attainments and moreover head of his family, felt great
chagrin at being thus passed over in favour of <persName>Munemori</persName>, who
was only second son of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family.

<p>Although it was at first rumoured that he would become a
priest, <persName>Tokudaiji Dono</persName>, wishing to see how affairs would turn
out, merely resigned his office of <persName>Dainagon</persName> and went into
retirement. Now the <persName>Shin Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> would
naturally come after <persName>Tokudaiji Kwazan-in</persName>, but how great was
his wrath at the elevation of such a person as <persName>Munemori</persName>, second
son of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family. So he went to the length of saying that
he would attain his long sought goal through the destruction of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. His father had only been <persName>Chunagon</persName> when he was
his age, but his youngest son had become <persName>Dainagon</persName> of the upper
second rank, and had received a great province as his fief, while
<pb n="39" xml:id="p63-39"/>

his sons and retainers also basked in the Imperial favour. What
then was lacking to him that he should plan such a thing? It
seems like the action of a demon. In the period of <placeName>Heiji</placeName>, when
he was <persName>Echigo-no-Chujo</persName>, he had taken the part of <persName>Nobuyori</persName> and
ought properly to have lost his head then, but his neck was
saved by the intercession of <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>. Now however,
forgetting all gratitude for this, even when no one was his enemy,
he was spending all his time in preparing weapons and collecting
soldiers and practising military activities to the exclusion of all
else. Now <placeName>Shishi-no-tani</placeName> on <placeName>Higashi-yama</placeName>, having <placeName>Miidera</placeName>
behind it was a very fine strategic position, and there was the
mountain seat of <persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName>, so he was always repairing
thither to plot the overthrow of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. One evening the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> went also and with him went <persName>Joken-Hoin</persName> the son of the
late <persName>Shonagon Nyudo Shinsai</persName>. During the evening banquet
they talked about this matter, and <persName>Hoin</persName> said; "What a foolish
thing; many people may overhear it and it will soon leak out
and a crisis will ensue in the country." Then the <persName>Dainagon</persName>,
changing his countenance, stood up suddenly, and knocked over
with the sleeve of his ‘<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kariginu</foreign>' a jar (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">heiji</foreign>) that stood before
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. His Majesty asked what he meant by it. The <persName>Daina-
gon</persName> returning to his seat replied; "The overthrow of the <persName>Heishi</persName>."
The <persName>Ho-o</persName> thereupon smiled with satisfaction and said, “Let
someone advance and dance the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Sarugaku</foreign>." <persName>Hei Hangwan
Yasuyori</persName> came,forth and said; "There are too many jars (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">heiji</foreign>)
here and so we are all intoxicated." <persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName> replied,
"Then what shall we do with them?" "It is best to take off
their necks," interjected <persName>Saiko Hoshi</persName>, as he took of the necks of
the jars. <persName>Hoin</persName>, considering this all great folly, said little.
</p>
<note type="footnote">Jars. Here again the pun on <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Heishi</foreign> referring to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family is

<p>Now this <persName>Hosshoji-no-Shugyo Shunkwan Sozu</persName> was the
grandson of <persName>Kyogoku-no-Gen-Dainagon Gashun-no-Kyo</persName> and the
son of <persName>Kidera Hoin Kwanga</persName>. The house of his grandfather the
<persName>Dainagon</persName> was not a military one, but he, being a man of violent
nature, did not easily let anyone pass before his house near the
<placeName>Sanjobo Gate</placeName> in <placeName>Kyogoku</placeName>, but usually would stand at the
middle gate grinding his teeth in a menacing manner. Being
therefore the grandson of such a formidable person, this <persName>Shun-
kwan</persName> also, though a priest, had a pugnacious and proud nature
so that he was just the person to take part in such an
unreasonable rebellion. <persName>Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName>, calling <persName>Tada-no-Kurando Yukitsuna</persName>, appointed him leader of one of the
forces saying; "If you accomplish this affair successfully, you
shall have as much as you wish of. fief and domain." And he
gave him fifty '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">tan</foreign>' of white silk for bow-bags as a gratuity.
</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the third month of the third year of
<placeName>An-gen</placeName> <persName>Myo-in-den</persName> became <persName>Dajodaijin</persName>, and <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>,
passing over <persName>Gen-Dainagon Sadafusa-no-Kyo</persName>, became <persName>Naidaijin</persName>,
so that soon after there was a great banquet to congratulate him
on becoming both <persName>Daijin</persName> and <persName>Taisho</persName>. The guest of honour was
<persName>Oi-no-Mikado Udaijin Tsunemune Ko</persName>. The <persName>Sadaijin</persName> ought to
have taken the upper seat, but as his father was <persName>Uji-no-Akusafu</persName>
(<persName>Fujiwara Yorinaga</persName>), there was some fear about such a precedent</p>
<p>There were no <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Hoku-men</foreign> (Imperial Guards) in ancient
times, but they were first established from the time of <persName>Shirakawa-</persName>

<p>in, and many of the <persName>Eifu</persName> obtained these posts. <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> and
<persName>Morishige</persName>, who were in their youth pages called <persName>Inumaru</persName> and
<persName>Senshumaru</persName>, and many other unimportant people also became
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Hoku-men</foreign>. During the time of <persName>Toba-in</persName>, <persName>Sueyori</persName> and <persName>Suenori</persName>,
father and son, were both serving in the Court, and though
sometimes acting as Courier from the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to the Imperial Court,
always behaved in a manner suitable to their rank, but the
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Hoku-men</foreign> of this time had too much power and did not respect
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kugyo</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Denjobito</foreign> at all. Passing from lower <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Hoku-men</foreign>
to upper, from that many were allowed to enter the Court, and
as they could achieve this they became puffed up and even went
so far as to join in this foolish rebellion. Among these were
<persName>Moromitsu</persName> and <persName>Narikage</persName>, who served the late <persName>Shonagon Nyudo
Shinsai</persName>. <persName>Moromitsu</persName> was in the government office in <placeName>Awa</placeName> and
<persName>Narikage</persName> was a man of the capital: he was born in a very low
station, being a '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kondei-warawa</foreign>,' or footsoldier or perhaps a kind
of table page.
As he was sagacious he came to be employed by
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. <persName>Moromitsu</persName> became <persName>Saemon-no-jo</persName> and <persName>Narikage</persName>
<persName>Uemon-no-jo</persName>, then both of them became <persName>Yukie-no-jo</persName>. Once
when something happened to <persName>Shinsai</persName> they both became priests,
taking the titles of <persName>Saemon-no-Nyudo Saiko</persName> and <persName>Uemon-no-jo
Saikei</persName>; but still after this they continued to hold the office of
Master of the storehouses to the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. This <persName>Saiko</persName> had a son
<persName>Morotaka</persName>, who also became powerful and rose to be <persName>Kebi-ishi
Go-i-no-jo</persName>. Furthermore on the nineteenth day of the twelfth
month of the first year of <placeName>An-gen</placeName>, at the appointment of officials
at <placeName>Tsuina</placeName>, (year-end ceremony) he became <persName>Kaga-no-kami</persName>.
While he was on duty in his province of <placeName>Kaga</placeName> he behaved
in a lawless and barbarous manner, seizing the domains of shrines
and temples and influential families, and doing always what was
disorderly in everything. Now even if there is no virtuous
governor, peaceful government may still continue, but among
his arbitrary actions, during the summer of the second year of
the same era, this Governor <persName>Morotaka</persName> brought his younger
brother <persName>Kondo Hangwan Morotsune</persName> to act as <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign> (Deputy).
<pb n="42" xml:id="p66-42"/>

Now there was a certain mountain temple called <placeName>Ugawa</placeName> near the
official residence of the Governor, and just as the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign>
arrived from the capital, the priests happened to be bathing,
whereupon he broke in among them, drove them off and bathed
in their stead, driving away those of lower rank who were
bathing near them so that his horse might be washed in their
place. Thereupon the priests became very angry and cried
out; "From of old this temple has been a sacred place where
officials cannot enter, so let us defend our privilege and stop this
invasion." Then the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign> replied angrily, "The former
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign> were all fools, so the present one has no reason to
follow their example: Obey the law!" But while he was
speaking the priests began to drive out his men, and they on their
part tried to force their way in, so that one of the legs of the
favourite horse of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign> <persName>Morotsune</persName> got broken in the
struggle. Then with their weapons they shot and hacked at
each other for several hours.
</p>
<p>At length when night began to fall, the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign>, seeing
that he could not overcome them, discreetly drew off his men.
Afterwards the officials of the province, gathering together
about a thousand men, came out to <placeName>Ugawa</placeName> and burnt down all
the buildings of the monastery. Now <placeName>Ugawa</placeName> was a branch
temple of <placeName>Hakuzan</placeName> and thither the chief priests went to appeal
for help, namely <persName>Chishaku</persName>, <persName>Gakumyo</persName>, <persName>Hodaibo</persName>, <persName>Shochi</persName>, <persName>Gakuon</persName>,
and <persName>Tosa-no-Ajari</persName>. <placeName>Hakuzan</placeName> consisted of three shrines and
eight temples, and all of these came out together, a great
multitude about two thousand men. On the ninth day of the
seventh month of the same year in the evening they made for
the official residence of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign> <persName>Morotsune</persName>. "Today is
already past; tomorrow we will fight," they said and only went
thus far that day. The dew-laden wind of autumn blew out the
tough sleeves of their bow-hands; the lightning flashing in
the sky gleamed on the stars of their helmets. The <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mokudai</foreign>,
fearing that he could not hold his own, fled by night to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>.
At the hour of the Hare (6. a.m.), the enemy rushed to the assault,
<pb n="43" xml:id="p67-43"/>

fiercely shouting their war-cry. From within the castle there is
no sound. When they send men to explore, they report that all
have vanished. Then the multitude, seeing that attack is needless,
draw off their forces, and, carrying with them the sacred emblem
of the middle shrine of <placeName>Hakuzan</placeName>, go off to appeal to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>.
At the hour of the Horse (12. noon.), they brought it to <placeName>Higashi
Sakamoto</placeName> on <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>: from the northern provinces the thunder
rolled ceaselessly toward the capital; snow fell and covered the
land on the mountain and in the city all was white even to the
twigs of the evergreens on the mountains when they brought the
sacred emblem to the shrine of <persName>Marodo</persName>. This shrine was the
<persName>Myori Gongen</persName> of <placeName>Hakuzan</placeName>, the relation of the two gods being
that of father and child. Though it was uncertain whether there
would be any response from the deity, it was a great pleasure to
the two gods to meet thus; greater even than that of <persName>Urashima</persName>
when he met his descendant of the seventh generation, or than
that of the son of <persName>Buddha</persName> at meeting his yet unknown father at
<placeName>Ryosen</placeName>. So this multitude of three thousand priests from seven
shrines each following close on the heel of the other, sleeve by
sleeve continually chanted the holy Sutras; it was indeed a sight
that defied description. Then the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> appealed to
the Emperor for the banishment of the <persName>Kokushi Kaga-no-kami
Morotaka</persName> and the imprisonment of the <persName>Mokudai Kondo Hang-
wan Morotsune</persName>, but no answer was made to the appeal. Seeing
this some of the influential nobles of the Court complained to
one another: "Alas! Why does not the Emperor decide the
affair quickly? From old times appeals from <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> have been
different from all others. <persName>Okura-no-Kyo Tamefusa</persName> and <persName>Dazai
Gon-no-Sotsu Suenaka-no-Kyo</persName> were very important Court
<pb n="44" xml:id="p68-44"/>

Officials but they were banished by appeal of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, how much
more <persName>Morotaka</persName> who is a man of little account; the thing ought
to be done properly." But, as the Chinese saying goes: “The
high officials fear for their emoluments and do not advise the
Throne, while the lower ones fear to make a mistake and so
keep silent." So in this case everyone kept his mouth shut in
council.

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>THE VOW.</head>
<p>Formerly, on the second day of the third month of the
second year of <placeName>Ka-ho</placeName>, <persName>Mino-no-kami Minamoto Yoshitsune Ason</persName>
had slain <persName>Eno</persName>, a veteran priest of <placeName>Hiei</placeName>, for depriving him of his
newly obtained fief, whereupon the chief priest of <persName>Hiyoshi</persName> and
the heads of <placeName>Enryakuji</placeName>, about thirty in all, came down with a
crowd of retainers and presented a petition demanding satisfaction.
On account of this, the <persName>Kwampaku of Go-Nijo</persName> (<persName>Fujiwara Moro-
michi</persName>) ordered <persName>Yamato Genji Nakatsukasa Gon-no-Sho Yoriharu</persName>
to take measures of defence, with the result that his retainers
<pb n="45" xml:id="p69-45"/>

shot arrows at the monks, killing eight of them on the spot and
wounding more than ten, so that the chief priest and the rest
fled in all directions. Then the superior priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>
flocked down in great numbers to report the matter to the
Emperor, but were met at <placeName>Nishi-Sakamoto</placeName> by <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> and
<persName>Kebiishi</persName> and driven back again: therefore, while the Emperor
was hesitating about his decision, they brought the sacred
emblem of <persName>Hiyoshi</persName> to the <placeName>Komponchudo</placeName> and chanted through
the six hundred volumes of the <title>Dai-Hannya Sutra</title> before it to
lay a curse on the <persName>Kwampaku of Go-Nijo</persName>. And the manner of
the petition was this; <persName>Chu-in Ho-in</persName>, who presided, (at that time
he was only <persName>Chu-in Gubu</persName>), taking the upper seat, rung the bell
and with reverence addressed the god thus, praying with a loud
voice;

cared for us from our youth up, do thou, we beseech thee, shoot
a whizzing arrow at the <persName>Kwampaku of Go-Nijo</persName>." There
upon ensued a strange portent; someone dreamed that the
whirring sound of a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kaburaya</foreign> was heard to proceed from
the shrine of <placeName>Hachioji</placeName> and go over toward <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, and the next
day, when they opened the lattices of the mansion of the <persName>Kwam-
paku</persName> they saw a branch of '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shikimi</foreign>' wet with dew as if it had
just come from the mountain, and that night the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>
was stricken with a sore disease because of the anger of the
deity and took to his bed. His mother <persName>O-Dono-no-Kita-no-Mandokoro</persName> in great grief went to the shrine of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName>, clothed
scantily like a very low menial, and prayed for seven days and
nights, offering for the success of her petition these gifts to be
dedicated to the god; a hundred performances of the dance
<pb n="46" xml:id="p70-46"/>

called <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shiba Dengaku</foreign>, a hundred horse races, a hundred courses
of equestrian archery, a hundred bouts of wrestling, a hundred
priests to chant the <title>Nio Sutra</title>, the same number to chant the
<title>Sutra of Yakushi</title>, a hundred statues of <persName>Yakushi</persName> half a hand
high, one life size figure of the same deity together with similar
statues of <persName>Shaka</persName> and <persName>Amida</persName>. Beside this she had in her heart
three other vows and, though there was no reason for anyone
to know what was in the depth of her mind, yet wonderful to
relate, at the close of the seventh night at the shrine, it happened
that a boy-priest, who had come with many others from the
remote province of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, died suddenly at midnight. When
they carried him out from the shrine and offered prayers, to the
amazement of the onlookers he stood up and danced, and after
dancing for the space of about half-an-hour, the god entered into
him and uttered this awe inspiring oracle :
</p>
<note type="footnote"><persName>Yakushi</persName>. Buddha the Healer. <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Sk. Bhechadjya</foreign>.</note>
<note type="footnote"><title>Hokke Mondoko</title>. A Catechism of the <title>Hokke-kyo</title> or <title>Saddharma-
pundarika Sutra</title>.</note>
<p>"Give ear O ye
people: for seven days of this month the mother of the <persName>Kwam-
paku</persName> has prayed in retirement before me: in her heart are three
vows. She asks that the life of her son may be spared: if this
be granted, first she will serve the shrine among the lowest
mendicants for a thousand days. I am moved with compassion that
the mother of the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>, who is so great that she regards all
the world as of no account, is so affected by her care for her son
that, forgetting the squalor of these people, she deigns to serve
the shrine among the lowest menials for a thousand days.
Secondly she will build a corridor from the <placeName>Hashidono</placeName> of the
main shrine to the shrine of <placeName>Hachioji</placeName>. How blessed a thing it
is that such a corridor should be built, for I feel pity for the
three thousand priests who must go across to the shrine whether
it rain or shrine. In the third place she will endow a <title>Hokke
Mondoko</title> to be held in perpetuity every day. All these vows
are by no means foolish, for though the first two might perhaps
be foregone, the <title>Hokke Mondoko</title> is most desirable. Now the
<pb n="47" xml:id="p71-47"/>

appeal that the priests made to the Emperor was very proper, but
no answer was given, only they were shot at and killed;
wherefore they came and called on me with tears so that I was moved
to compassion and felt that it was a thing I could never forget;
moreover the arrows that were shot at them injured my body
in its Buddha manifestation. See here whether I speak truth or
falsehood;" and the medium, doffing his clothing, displayed
under his left armpit a hollow like the mouth of a cup. Then
he continued: "indeed this is so grievous to me that however
much she vows I cannot prolong his life to the natural span, but
if the <title>Hokke Mondoko</title> be endowed I will allow him to live for
three years longer. If this be thought too little, I can do no
more." With this the god ceased and withdrew himself.
</p>
<p>Now the mother of the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> had not said anything
to anyone about her vow so that it never entered her mind that
it could be known, and she was deeply impressed that the secret
thoughts of her heart should thus become the subject of an
oracle; and especially was she thankful that the life of her son
should be prolonged for a day or even for half an hour, how
much more that three years should be granted him. Thus,
restraining her tears, she departed homeward. Afterwards she
presented her son's domain of <placeName>Tanaka-no-Sho</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Ki-i</placeName> to the shrine of <placeName>Hachioji</placeName> for ever, and so it is that we hear
that to the present day the <title>Hokke Mondoko</title> is held every day
without ceasing at the shrine of <placeName>Hachioji</placeName>.
</p>
<p>Thus the sickness of the <persName>Kwampaku of Go-Nijo</persName> was healed
and he was restored whole as before to the great joy of his
family, but alas, the three years flew by like a dream, and in
the twenty-first day of the sixth month of the second year of
<placeName>Ei-cho</placeName> a boil broke out at the edge of his hair, so that he took
to his bed, and on the twenty-seventh day of the same month he
passed away at the age of thirty-eight. Though he was brave,
strong-minded and valiant in his actions, when his illness became
critical he could not bear to die. Indeed it was a sad case, and
sadder too that he should die before his father before reaching
<pb n="48" xml:id="p72-48"/>

the age of forty. There is no reason why a father should die
before his children, but even <persName>Buddha</persName> the perfection of virtue, or
the most enlightened <persName>Bosatsu</persName> have no power to change the
decrees of life and death. A god who is really just and merciful
cannot fail to punish for the good of mankind,

<head>CARRYING DOWN THE SACRED CARS.</head>
<p>Thus, though the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> had many times
petitioned the Emperor for the banishment of the <persName>Kokushi Kaga-no-
kami Morotaka</persName> and the imprisonment of the <persName>Mokudai Kondo
Hangwan Morotsune</persName>, yet no answer was given them, so, without
celebrating the festival of <persName>Hiyoshi</persName>, on the thirteenth day of the
fourth month of the third year of <placeName>An-gen</placeName> at the first hour of the
Dragon, (8. p.m.) they set out with the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mikoshi</foreign> or sacred cars
of the three shrines of <placeName>Juzenji</placeName>, <placeName>Marodo</placeName>, and <placeName>Hachioji</placeName> at
their head, while with them went the priests of the gods and
Buddhas from <placeName>Sagarematsu</placeName>, <placeName>Kiretsuzumi</placeName>, <placeName>Kamo-no-kawara</placeName>,
<placeName>Tadasu</placeName>, <placeName>Umetada</placeName>, <placeName>Yanagihara</placeName>, <placeName>Tohoku-in</placeName>, and others with their
monks and followers, an innumerable host. As they entered
<placeName>Ichijo</placeName> from the western side, people wondered if the sun and
moon had not fallen from heaven. Thereupon the Emperor
ordered the generals of the houses of <orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName> to secure the
four quarters of the Palace enclosure and to protect the city
against the priestly multitude. Then <persName>Komatsu Naidaijin Sadai-
sho Shigemori</persName> with about three thousand horsemen secured the
three gates of the Palace called <placeName>Yomei</placeName>, <placeName>Taiken</placeName>, and <placeName>Yubo</placeName>,
while his younger brothers <persName>Munemori</persName>, <persName>Tomomori</persName> and <persName>Shigehira</persName>,
with his uncles <persName>Yorimori</persName> and <persName>Tsunemori</persName> held the south western
gates. Of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, <persName>Gensammi Minamoto Yorimasa</persName> the Warden
of the Palace with his retainers the <persName>Watanabe</persName> father and son,
and about three hundred horsemen held the <placeName>Nuidono</placeName> Palace at
the north gate. This position being an extensive one and the
troops few, they presented a very scattered appearance, so that
<pb n="49" xml:id="p73-49"/>

the priests, perceiving this to be the weakest point in the defences,
determined to try and bring in their sacred emblem by the north
gate. Then <persName>Yorimasa</persName> quickly leapt from his horse, and taking
off his helmet and rinsing his mouth with water, made humble
obeisance before the sacred emblem, all his three hundred
retainers likewise following his example, after which he sent
<persName>Watanabe Choshichi Tonau</persName> as an envoy to the priests. He
was attired that day in a '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign>' of light green, and body
armour ornamented with cherry blossoms on a yellow ground,
and wore a sword with mounts of red copper; in his quiver he
carried twenty four arrows feathered with white and under his
arm was a bow lacquered in black and bound with red bands.
Taking off his helmet he slung it over his shoulder by the thong,
and standing reverently before the sacred car, spoke thus: "Be
silent a while, I pray you, and hear my message from <persName>Gensammi
Dono</persName>. The appeal of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> to the Throne was certainly
justified, and we also regret the slowness of the decision, so that not
without reason do you bring hither your sacred car: <persName>Yorimasa</persName>
however has but few men wherewith to hold this gate, and if you
decide to force your way in at such an unguarded place you will
be a laughing-stock to the children of the city and it will be
remembered to your shame in days to come. If we open the gate
to you we shall be disobedient to the Imperial Order and if we
try to defend it, I, who have always revered the god of <placeName>Iozan</placeName>,
can no longer follow the way of the warrior. Truly either path
is beset with difficulty. The eastern side is held in strong force
by <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>, so it is there that you ought to try and enter."
</p>
<p>On hearing this the priests hesitated and were undecided as
to what to do, when some youthful and worthless ones among
them cried out: "Wherefore do ye thus delay; push on through
the gate." As many took up this cry, an aged priest called
<persName>Setsu-no-Rissha Ko-un</persName>, the wisest of all in the three halls, stood
forth and said: "This request is very reasonable. If we break
through the strongest place with our sacred car it will be greatly
to our credit in time to come; and moreover this <persName>Yorimasa</persName> is
<pb n="50" xml:id="p74-50"/>

of the purest line of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, descended from the sixth Imperial
Grandson, having no equal in martial arts, and renowned not
only as a warrior but also as a poet; for while <persName>Konoe-in</persName> was on
the Throne, it happened that a verse-party was proposed at
which the subject suggested for composition was, "Flowers
in the recesses of the mountains ; and this theme embarrassed
the versemakers very much, but <persName>Yorimasa</persName> won great admiration
from the Emperor by his famous improvisation;
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Cherry boughs do not show 'mid the trees in the depths
of the mountains;</l>
<l>But at the time of bloom, beauteous the flowers appear."</l>
</lg>
<p>Do not then let us put to shame one who has merited the
Imperial admiration on an occasion like this. Let us carry in
the sacred car elsewhere." Moved by this advice, thousands of
the monks from front to rear shouted assent, and, forthwith
carrying the sacred car round to the eastern side, made to enter
the Palace through the <placeName>Taiken</placeName> gate. Here a struggle ensued,
for the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> drew their bows and shot at them so that many
arrows struck the sacred car of <placeName>Juzenji</placeName> and some of the priests
were killed, many of their followers being wounded, the noise
of the shouts and groans ascending even to the <placeName>Bonten</placeName> Paradise,
while <persName>Kenro-Chijin</persName>, the mighty Earth-deity, was struck with
consternation. Then the priestly bands, leaving their sacred
cars behind at the gate, fled back lamenting to their temples.

<head>THE BURNING OF THE PALACE.</head>
<p>That night the Retired Emperor gave orders to <persName>Kurodo-no-Sashoben Kanemitsu</persName> that a council of the Courtiers should
be held immediately. At the time that they brought down the
sacred cars before in the fourth month of the fourth year of

<p>shrine of <placeName>Sekizan</placeName>: also in the seventh month of the fourth year
of <placeName>Ho-en</placeName>, he had ordered the <persName>Betto of Gion</persName> to bring it into the
shrine of <placeName>Gion</placeName>; now, according to the precedent of <placeName>Ho-en</placeName>, he
ordered <persName>Gondai Sozu Choken</persName>, <persName>Betto of Gion</persName>, to bring it again
to that shrine at nightfall, and this being done the arrows that
stuck in it were pulled out by the priests. From of old,
reckoning from the period of <placeName>Ei-kyu</placeName>, until now the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>
have brought down their sacred car six times, but, though every
time the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> were ordered to restrain them, arrows had
never been shot until this occasion. The people of the capital
were greatly terrified, fearing that the anger of the god would
bring calamity on the city.
</p>
<p>On the fourteenth day at midnight the monks of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>
again flocked down into the city, so the Emperor, ordering his
palanquin in the middle of the night, went to the <persName>Retired Emperor's</persName> Palace at <placeName>Hojuji-den</placeName>, while the Imperial Consort and the
other Ladies of the Palace went in their cars to some other palace,
the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> and <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> and other inferior Courtiers
precipitately following them in a panic. The <persName>Naidaijin Komatsu
Dono</persName> attended them wearing ordinary dress with a quiver of
arrows on his back, his heir <persName>Gon-no-suke Koremori</persName> going with
him in ceremonial costume carrying a flat quiver. Both in the
Palace and in the city, high and low, rich and poor, all were in
a state of confusion and tumult.
</p>
<p>Now at <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> three thousand priests met in council,
clamouring that as their sacred car had been shot at and many
of their company killed and wounded, they must burn all the
temples from <placeName>Omiya</placeName> and <placeName>Ninomiya</placeName> to <placeName>Kodo</placeName> and <placeName>Chudo</placeName> as a
protest against the indignity, and go forth and take up their
abode on the mountain and moor. At this point it appeared
that the <persName>Ho-o</persName> wished to propose something with regard to the
matter, and the senior priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> went to ascend
the mountain to inform the others, but these came down in great
numbers as far as <placeName>Nishi-Sakamoto</placeName> and drove them back again.
Now <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName>, who at this time held
<pb n="52" xml:id="p76-52"/>

the office of <persName>Saemon-no-kami</persName>, had been appointed one of the
presiding ministers (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Jokei</foreign>), and he was sent as an envoy to the
monks; these however assembled in the courtyard of the <placeName>Dai-
kodo</placeName> and cried out;" let us seize <persName>Tokitada</persName>, pull off his '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kammu-
ri</foreign>' and then bind him and throw him into the lake." On seeing
this, <persName>Tokitada</persName> begged them to listen quietly to what he had to
say, and taking a small ink-stone and paper from his bosom, he
wrote a few words and gave it to them. What they read was
this; "The lawless violence of the priests is the work of a devil:
a righteous monarch restrains it by virtue of his enlightened
rebirth." Abashed by this reproof the monks forbore to lay
hands on him, but admitting the truth of his statement with one
accord, they all dispersed in silence to their cells and valleys.
Thus did <persName>Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> win the admiration of everyone by
calming the wrath of the three thousand priests of the Three
Halls by writing a few words on a piece of paper, and thus
averting insult from the Emperor and himself. The monks too,
who had hitherto been regarded as only wishing to stir up
disorder, were now respected for their reasonable conduct.
</p>
<p>On the twentieth day an Imperial Mandate was issued through
<persName>Kwazan-in Gon-Chunagon Tadachika-no-Kyo</persName> the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Jokei</foreign> that the
<persName>Kokushi Kaga-no-kami Morotaka</persName> should be dismissed and
banished to <placeName>Idota</placeName> in <placeName>Owari</placeName> and that his Brother <persName>Kondo Hangwan Morotsune</persName> should be imprisoned: also on the thirteenth
day six <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who had shot at the sacred car were also
imprisoned; they were all retainers of <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the twentieth day at the hour of the Dog
(8. p.m.), a fire broke out at <placeName>Higuchi Tomi-no-koji</placeName> and a great
part of <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> was burned. A south-east wind was blowing
strongly at the time and the flames swept across the city
diagonally like a great wheel and burned through to the south-west,
to the distance of from three to five <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign>: a very terrible sight
indeed. <persName>Guhei Shinno's</persName> palace at <placeName>Chigusa</placeName>, the <placeName>Kobai</placeName> palace at
<placeName>Kitano Tenjin</placeName>, <persName>Ritsu Issei's</persName> palace at <placeName>Haematsu</placeName>, the <placeName>Oni</placeName> palace,
the <placeName>Takamatsu</placeName> palace, the <placeName>Kamoi</placeName> palace, the <placeName>Kanin</placeName> palace of
<pb n="53" xml:id="p77-53"/>

<persName>Higashi Sanjo Fuyutsugu-no-Otodo</persName>, the <placeName>Horikawa</placeName> palace of
<persName>Fujiwara Mototsune</persName>, beside thirty other palaces famous from
ancient days. Sixteen palaces belonging to Court Nobles of the
highest rank were burned, beside those of other Courtiers and
high officials without number. At last the fire reached the
Imperial Palace, and starting from the <placeName>Shujaku</placeName> gate, the <placeName>Oten</placeName>
gate, the <placeName>Kaisho</placeName> gate, the <placeName>Daikoku-den</placeName>, the <placeName>Buraku-in</placeName>, the eight
offices of the Palace administration and the Office of Records
were all reduced to ashes in a moment; the annals of families
and the documents of many generations beside many treasures
of great worth were all burnt to cinders. No one could estimate
the damage. Several hundred people were burnt to death and
cattle without number. Moreover it was no ordinary event that
there were some who dreamed of two or three thousand great
monkeys coming down from <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> with torches to set fire to
the city as a punishment from the god of that place.
</p>
<p>The <placeName>Daikyokuden</placeName> was burned for the first time in the age,
of <persName>Seiwa Tenno</persName> in the eighteenth year of <placeName>Jokan</placeName>, and on the third
day of the first month of the nineteenth year the Coronation
Ceremony of the <persName>Emperor Yosei</persName> took place in the <placeName>Buraku-in</placeName>.
On the ninth day of the fourth month of the first year of <placeName>Gwankyo</placeName>
they began to rebuild it, and it was finished on the eighth day of
the tenth month of the second year. In the reign of <persName>Go-Reizei-
in</persName>, on the twenty-sixth day of the second month of the fifth year
of <placeName>Tenki</placeName> it was again burned and on the fourteenth day of the
eighth month of the fourth year of <placeName>Jiryaku</placeName> they again began to
rebuild it, but the <persName>Emperor Go-Reizei</persName> died before it was
finished. In the reign of <persName>Go-Sanjo-in</persName> on the fifteenth day of the fourth
month of the fourth year of <placeName>Enkyu</placeName> it was finished, and the Im-
perial Court removed to it, the literary men dedicating many
compositions and the musicians making melody. As the present
age was a degenerate one and the strength of the country was
exhausted, it has not yet been rebuilt.

<head>EXILE OF THE ZASSHU.</head>
<p>On the fifth day of the fifth month of the first year of
<placeName>Jisho</placeName> the <persName>Tendai Zasshu Mei-un Dai-Sojo</persName> was prohibited from
attending Court, and the <persName>Nyo-i-rin Honzon</persName>, the tutelary Buddha
of the Court, being brought back by an official of the <orgName>Kurodo-
dokoro</orgName>, he was also deprived of his office of Chaplain-in-waiting.
This was because the <orgName>Kebiishicho</orgName> had been ordered to hand
over the ringleader of the bands of priests who had lately brought
down the sacred car to the Palace. Now the <persName>Ho-o</persName> had heard
a slanderous tale from <persName>Saiko-hoshi</persName> and his son to the effect that
the <persName>Zasshu</persName> had some fiefs in <placeName>Kaga</placeName> and that when the <persName>Kokushi
Morotaka</persName> confiscated them, in his resentment at it he had got
the priests to make their petition so that it might trouble the
Court, and this made His Majesty exceedingly angry so that he
ordered him to be punished severely. So, as the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was thus
ill-disposed to him, <persName>Mei-un</persName> relinquished his seal of office and
resigned his position. On the eleventh day of the same month
<persName>Kakukai-ho Shinno</persName>, the seventh son of <persName>Toba-in</persName>, was made <persName>Ten-
dai Zasshu</persName>: he was the pupil of <persName>Gyo-ken</persName> the <persName>Dai-Sojo</persName> of <placeName>Sho-
ren-in</placeName>. On the twelfth day, in addition to depriving him of
office and emoluments, two officers of the <orgName>Kebiishi-cho</orgName> were
about to apply the examination by fire and water, putting a
cover on the well and throwing water on the fire; whereupon,
<pb n="55" xml:id="p79-55"/>

fearing that the priests would again descend on them, the people
of the city made a great outcry.

was a picture or statue of <persName>Nyoirin Kwannon</persName>, or <persName>Kwannon</persName> holding the

<note type="footnote"><persName>Tendai Zasshu</persName>. <placeName>Heizan</placeName> was the chief seat of the <orgName>Tendai</orgName> sect, so
called from the mountain <placeName>Tendaisan</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName> (<placeName>T'ien t'ai</placeName>) and founded by
<persName>Dengyo Daishi</persName>, so the head of it was called the <persName>Tendai Zasshu</persName>.</note>
<p>On the eighteenth day thirteen Courtiers below the <persName>Dajo-
daijin</persName> assembled in council to pronounce sentence on the ex-
<persName>Zasshu</persName>. Then <persName>Hachijo-no-Chunagon Nagakata-no-Kyo</persName>, who
was then only <persName>Sadaiben-no-Saisho</persName> and took the lowest seat,
arose and said; “Though according to the advice of the lawyers
we ought to abate the death penalty one degree and pass sentence
of exile, yet, seeing that the ex-<persName>Zasshu Mei-un Dai-Sojo</persName> is not only
learned in both the <orgName>Tendai</orgName> and <orgName>Shingon</orgName> doctrine, but is a man
of pure and holy life who has taught the <title>Mahayana Sutras</title> to
the Courtiers and instructed the <persName>Ho-o</persName> in the Buddhist
commandments, it is indeed difficult to pass a severe sentence on such
a teacher of the Sutras and the Law: it were better if we
mitigate the sentence of exile." When he had thus spoken his
opinion unreservedly, all the other Courtiers agreed to his
suggestion, but as the resentment of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was so deep, in the
end they passed the sentence of exile. <persName>Kiyomori Nyudo</persName> also,
when he heard of it, proceeded to visit the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to persuade
him to remit the sentence, but the <persName>Ho-o</persName> being indisposed with a
cold and unable to see anyone, he had to return without
effecting anything. In the case of a priest committing a crime it is
the custom that he should render up his orders and become a
layman, and in accordance with this rule the ex-<persName>Zasshu</persName> took the
civil title of <persName>Dainagon-no-Taiyu Fujii Matsueda</persName>. This <persName>Mei-un</persName>,
we speak it with all reverence, was the son of <persName>Kuga-no-Dainagon
Akimichi-no-Kyo</persName>, a descendant in the sixth generation of <persName>Guhei
Shinno</persName> seventh son of <persName>Murakami Tenno</persName>, and the most revered
and virtuous ecclesiastic in the land, respected by both Emperor
and subject he was also the <persName>Betto</persName> of <placeName>Rokushoji</placeName>, one of temples
of <placeName>Tennoji</placeName>. Now the chief of the Court Diviners, <persName>Onyo-no-
kami Abe-no-Yasuchika</persName>, had said of him; "It is
incomprehensible to me that such a wise man as this should take the name of
<persName>Mei-un</persName>, written ... shining clouds.
<pb n="56" xml:id="p80-56"/>

<persName>Mei-un</persName>, for thought the sun and moon are shining (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mei</foreign>) above,
yet unfortunately clouds (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">un</foreign>) are below." He became <persName>Zasshu</persName>
on the twentieth day of the second month of the first year of
<placeName>Nin-an</placeName>, and was deposed on the fifteenth day of the third month
of the same year.
</p>
<p>It is related that, on opening the treasury of the <placeName>Chudo</placeName> as
the custom was, among various other treasures there was a box
about a foot long wrapped in white linen, and when this faultless
<persName>Zasshu</persName> opened it and looked therein he found a roll of yellow
paper on which <persName>Dengyo Daishi</persName> had written the names of all the
<persName>Zasshu</persName> who should be in time to come, and he read as far as his
own name, but after that, reading no more, he rolled up the
scroll again and put it back as it was before. It was very sad
that even such a venerable priest as he could not escape the
results of the <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">karma</foreign> of his previous existence. On the
twentyfirst day it was decided that he should be exiled to <placeName>Izu</placeName>. Many
people said different things about the cause of it, but really it
was owing to the slander of <persName>Saiko-hoshi</persName> and his son that this
thing was done. As he was to be expelled from the capital
immediately, the officials who were entrusted with this duty
went to his residence at <placeName>Shirakawa</placeName> : the <persName>Zasshu</persName> left his residence
weeping and went to a place where the holy Sutras were kept
near <placeName>Awataguchi</placeName>. At <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> they came to the conclusion that
their opponents were none other than <persName>Saiko-hoshi</persName> and his son, and
writing their names on a paper they put it under the left foot of
<persName>Kompira Taisho</persName>, the first of the twelve <persName>Shinsho</persName>, in the <placeName>Kompon-
chudo</placeName> and cried aloud with many imprecations on the twelve
<persName>Shinsho</persName> and the seven hundred <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Yasha</foreign> to take away the life of
<persName>Saiko-hoshi</persName> and his son without delay. Only to hear them was
a terrible thing. On the twenty-third day the <persName>Zasshu</persName> went out
from the Hall of the Sutras to his place of exile. How pitiful
to behold one of the high rank of <persName>Dai-Sojo</persName>, being expelled by
<pb n="57" xml:id="p81-57"/>

these officials, about to cross the eastern boundary on this his
last day in the capital! When he came to the shore of <placeName>Uchide</placeName>
near <placeName>Otsu</placeName> and saw the white eaves of the <placeName>Monju-ro</placeName> shining in the
sun, without taking a second glance, burying his face in his
sleeve, he was choked with tears. There were many aged and
virtuous priests at <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> but among them <persName>Choken-hoin</persName>, who
was only <persName>Sozu</persName> at that time, was the most renowned, and he felt
so much regret that he went as far as <placeName>Awazu</placeName> to see him on his
way. On taking leave of him there the <persName>Zasshu</persName>, out of gratitude
taught him the theory of concentration and the three
contemplations, a doctrine that he had kept stored up in his mind for
many years and that was originally possessed by <persName>Shaka</persName> himself
and handed down through <persName>Memyo</persName> the <persName>Bikkhu</persName> of <placeName>Benares</placeName> and
<persName>Ryuju Bosatsu</persName> of southern <placeName>India</placeName>. It is most praiseworthy that
though our country is on the confines of the world, small and
scattered like grains of millet, and was at this time most
degenerate, yet <persName>Choken</persName>, on possessing this doctrine, wept for joy as
he returned to the capital. Then at <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> the priests again
assembled and took counsel together saying;" Since the time of
<persName>Gishin Osho</persName> who first held the office of <persName>Tendai Zasshu</persName>, for
fiftyfive generations until now no <persName>Zasshu</persName> has ever been sent into
exile; and when we consider that, since the period <placeName>En-ryaku</placeName> when
the Emperor founded the Imperial Capital, and <persName>Dengyo Daishi</persName>
ascended this mountain,—where woman who possesses the Five
Defects has never set foot—and taught us according to the
Doctrine of the Four Enlightenments, three thousand holy
<pb n="58" xml:id="p82-58"/>

priests have taken up their abode on this peak, where the <title>Hokke-
Kyo</title> is chanted continuously, while at its foot the Spirit of the
god is daily revealed to men; and that just as <placeName>Ryozen</placeName> the sacred
mountain of <placeName>Gesshi</placeName>, where is the sacred cave of <persName>Shaka</persName>, is situated
on the north-east of the Imperial city, so is this mountain of
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName> also placed at the north-east of <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, as a sacred site
to protect the land: seeing that generations of revered
sovereigns and wise ministers have elected to worship therein,
why, even in a degenerate age like this, do they dare to offer us
so great an insult?" So all the priests of the mountain with
their followers again came down to <placeName>Higashi-Sakamoto</placeName> and
held a council before <persName>Juzenji Gongen</persName> saying: "Let us go to
<placeName>Awazu</placeName> and bring back our chief, but as he is guarded by
the officials who have expelled him, it will not be so easy to
take him away: thus we have no other refuge but the deities
of our mountain. If we are to rescue him without any
untoward event let us first obtain a favourable omen." To this
end the elder priests betook themselves vigorously to prayer.

<note type="footnote"><placeName>Gesshi</placeName> India.</note>
<p>Now there was a youth of eighteen named <persName>Tsuru-maru</persName>, a
servant of <persName>Yo-en Risshi</persName> a priest of <placeName>Mudoji</placeName>, who suddenly fell into a
trance, both body and mind being in travail, so that the sweat
ran from his limbs, for the <persName>Juzenji Gongen</persName> had entered into him,
and he spoke saying: "Even though this is a degenerate age,
how do they dare to send my priest into exile to a far country?
My heart is cast down, therefore there is no reason why I should
stop at the foot of this mountain from henceforth": and he
pressed his sleeves to his eyes and wept. Astonished at this
portent the priestly multitude exclaimed. 'If this be indeed
the oracle of <persName>Juzenji Gongen</persName>, let this be a sign; restore each of
these to its rightful owner:" and four or five hundred of the
elder priests threw down the rosaries which they held in their
<pb n="59" xml:id="p83-59"/>

hands on to the verandah of the shrine of <placeName>Juzenji Gongen</placeName>. Then
the possessed youth, running round and gathering them up,
without an error distributed them each to the one who owned
it. Then all the priests wrung their hands and wept for joy at
this miracle that the deity had manifested anew.
</p>
<p>"Let us
go and take him from them;" they shouted as they rose up, and
swept on like a great cloud, while on the shore road toward
<placeName>Shiga</placeName> and <placeName>Karasaki</placeName> another multitude came trooping, and yet
another took ship on the lake toward <placeName>Yamada</placeName> and <placeName>Yabase</placeName>.
When they saw this the officers who were charged with
the expulsion of the <persName>Zasshu</persName> scattered and fled in all directions.
The multitude them came on to <placeName>Kokubunji</placeName>, whereat the ex-
<persName>Zasshu</persName> was greatly astonished and exclaimed: "I have heard
that one who is exiled by the Emperor cannot see the shining of
the sun and moon, how much less can I, whom the Retired
Emperor has ordered to depart immediately, remain in this
place: return I beseech you to your temples." Then advancing
to the edge of the temple verandah, he addressed them thus :
"Since I left the princely mansion of my father and entered the
school of the <orgName>Tendai</orgName> sect, I have studied widely the ordinances
thereof, learning the doctrines of both <orgName>Tendai</orgName> and <orgName>Shingon</orgName>, being
only concerned for the prosperity of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, not neglecting to
pray for the welfare of the nation and deeply considering the
education of the monks: to this the deities of both <placeName>Koya</placeName> and
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName> will testify. There is no fault on my part, but innocent
of any crime I have received this heavy sentence of exile. I
have no enmity toward either the world or man or gods or
Buddhas; indeed for your good intention in coming thus far to
see me my gratitude is past expressing ;" and he wrung the
sleeves of his garment wet with tears. The priests also wept
into the sleeves of their armour, but on their bringing up the
palanquin and urging him to enter it, the ex-<persName>Zasshu</persName> refused and
continued; "Formerly I was the chief of three thousand priests,
but now I have become a mere exile, how shall I be carried on
the shoulders of such noble disciples and deeply learned monks?
<pb n="60" xml:id="p84-60"/>

Even if I come back again I ought to walk shod in straw
sandals like any common priest." Now there was a certain
disorderly priest of the <placeName>Saito Hall</placeName> named <persName>Kaijo-bo-no-Ajari Yukei</persName>,
a huge fellow who stood seven feet high, dressed in armour of
black leather and metal loosely laced, with very long
thighpieces; removing his helmet he gave it to one of his fellow
priests, and leaning on the white handle of his halberd and
pushing aside the crowd on either side, he stood before the ex-
<persName>Zasshu</persName>. Glaring at him with wide-open eyes for a while, he said
peremptorily : "It is because you are of such a mind that this
misfortune has befallen you. Now get in immediately!"
Then the <persName>Zasshu</persName> in fear of him straightway entered the
palanquin.
</p>
<p>In their joy at recovering him only the noblest of the
priests his disciples and none of those of low rank took turns in
carrying his chair, but <persName>Yukei</persName> continued without being relieved,
going on in front gripping both the pole of the palanquin and
the handle of his halberd with such vigour that it seemed they
would break asunder. Thus they traversed the eastern slope of
the mountain as though they marching over level ground,
Putting down the chair in the court of <placeName>Daikodo</placeName>, they once more
held a confabulation, debating thus ; "Now we have gone even
to <placeName>Awazu</placeName> and brought back our <persName>Zasshu</persName>, but how can we
appoint as our head one who is under sentence of exile by the
Emperor ?" Then <persName>Kaijobo Ajari Yukei</persName> again came forward and
said; "This our mountain is a holy place unequalled in <placeName>Nippon</placeName>,
a place of holy doctrine that protects our nation, the power of
whose gods is very mighty. <persName>Buddha</persName> is equal in authority to
the Emperor, so that men do not hold in light esteem the
opinion of even the lowest priest; how much more then that of
the most noble chief of three thousand priests, the holy and
virtuous head of our whole mountain. That he should be
punished without fault, does it not call for the wrath both of
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName> and the capital that we should thus be made a derision
to <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName> and <placeName>Onjoji</placeName>? How sad to lose the greatest master</p>
<pb n="61" xml:id="p85-61"/>

<p>of the law of Tendai and Shingon, and that our students should
for long have to neglect their studies. Make me the leader of
your hosts and though I be imprisoned or exiled or lose my
head, it will be a good memorial in this world and the next."
Thus he spoke, weeping vehemently, and the assembled thousands
assented to his words. Since this time <persName>Yukei</persName> was called '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Ika-
me-bo</foreign>' (the wrathful priest) and his pupil <persName>Eikei Risshi</persName> the
people also nicknamed <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Ko-Ikame-bo</foreign>, (the lesser wrathful priest).

<p>Now the priests brought their ex-<persName>Zasshu</persName> to <placeName>Myo-ko-in</placeName>
which is in the southern valley of the <placeName>To-to</placeName> or eastern pagoda.
Perchance even a <persName>Gonge</persName> (manifestation of Buddha) cannot
avoid a chance misfortune like his.
</p>
<p>Of old time in <placeName>China</placeName>, <persName>Ikko Ajari</persName>, Court Chaplain to the
<persName>Emperor Genso</persName> of the <orgName>To</orgName> dynasty, was raised to favour and
confidence by the <persName>Empress Yo-ki-hi</persName>, and as both then and now
in great and small countries people will babble, he fell under
suspicion, and even though it was groundless he was exiled to
the land of <placeName>Kara</placeName>. To this land there were three roads; that
called <placeName>Rinchi-do</placeName>, the Imperial Road, that called <placeName>Yuchi-do</placeName> by
which the common people travelled, and that called <placeName>Anketsu-do</placeName>
(dark cave way) by which criminals travelled; so this <persName>Ikko
Ajari</persName>, having committed a great crime, had to go by the
<placeName>Anketsu-do</placeName>, and for seven days and nights without seeing the
sun or moon he travelled on it. As it was thus dark and there
was no inhabitant, he lost his way, wandering on the shore of a
lake and going through a deeply wooded mountain, while only
the voice of a bird was heard in a watery ravine. While he was
weeping there so that his garments were wet as moss, a god took
pity on him, exiled without cause, and delivered him by showing
nine luminaries in the sky. Then <persName>Ikko</persName>, biting a finger of his
left hand, drew the nine luminaries on his left sleeve with the

nine luminaries is the chief object of worship of the <orgName>Shingon-shu</orgName>.

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>EXECUTION OF SAIKO.</head>
<p>When the <persName>Ho-o</persName> learned that the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> had
prevented the <persName>Zasshu</persName> from being exiled, he was much perturbed:
then <persName>Saiko-hoshi</persName> said; "From of old the monks of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> have
been in the habit of making these disorderly uprisings; this is
not the first time, but this time they have gone too far, and if
you do not punish them in an exemplary manner from
henceforth the government will always be unstable.” Thus he
spoke, unaware of the prayers for his own destruction, or of the
appearance of the god of the mountain, and confusing the mind
of the Emperor. "A subject who advises the Emperor falsely
stirs up confusion in the country." This is a true saying; even
though one tries to grow many orchids, the wind of autumn
will destroy them, and even when rulers desire to be clear in
their minds a lying minister will speak thus to darken their
counsel.
</p>
<p>Soon it was rumoured that the <persName>Ho-o</persName> had ordered <persName>Shin-
Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> to assemble his retainers and attack
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and that some of the priests of that mountain thought
that as they were subjects of the Emperor, it was not right to
resist the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> command and secretly intended to obey them:
so the ex-<persName>Zasshu</persName>, living at <placeName>Myokobo</placeName>, hearing that the minds of
the priests were thus divided, was much troubled wondering
what fresh misfortune would come upon him; but still no
decision was made concerning his sentence of exile.
</p>
<p>Thus the long-cherished plan of the <persName>Shin-Dainagon</persName> for the
overthrow of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> was delayed owing to the riotous
conduct of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>. Some deliberation and preparations had been
<pb n="63" xml:id="p87-63"/>

made, but they were only pretence, and as it seemed that the
plot was not likely to succeed, <persName>Tada Kurando Yukitsuna</persName>, who
had been entrusted with the arrangements, thinking apparently
that it was no use going further, used the linen which had been
presented to him as material for bow-cases to make '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign>'
and '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">katabira</foreign>' for his retainers. Then, on meditating over the
affair and seeing the prosperity of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, it seemed a very
difficult thing to overthrow them; and if the matter chanced to
leak out, he himself would be the first to be executed, so he
thought it would be better to betray it before anyone else could
do so, and thus save his own life. So on the twenty-ninth day
about midnight he went to the mansion of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> at <placeName>Nishi
Hachijo</placeName> saying that he had important business. As <persName>Yukitsuna</persName>
was not accustomed to visit him, the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, wondering why he
had come, sent <persName>Shume-no-Hangwan Morikuni</persName> to enquire. <persName>Yuki-
tsuna</persName> however replied that he could not tell anyone else,
whereupon the <persName>Nyudo</persName> himself came out to the corridor at the middle
gate. "As it is now midnight," he said, "what can you have
to any to me at such a time?" "In the daytime there are
many people about," replied <persName>Yukitsuna</persName>, "so I have come under
cover of night; what do you think is the meaning of the warlike
preparations now going on at the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>?" "I
understand that the <persName>Ho-o</persName> has a plan to attack <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>," replied
<persName>Kiyomori</persName> carelessly. Then <persName>Yukitsuna</persName> drawing nearer
whispered to him: "That is not the reason, it is against your house that
they make these preparations." "Has the <persName>Ho-o</persName> any knowledge
of it?" asked the <persName>Nyudo</persName>. "Without doubt he knows about
it; it is with his authority that <persName>Shitsuji-no-Betto Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> is collecting his forces." And he went on to explain what
<persName>Yasuyori</persName>, <persName>Shunkwan</persName> and <persName>Saiko</persName> had done; after which he
retired and the <persName>Nyudo</persName> called out loudly to summon his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>.
<persName>Yukitsuna</persName>, having said what had better have been left unsaid,
fearing that he might be called on to prove his words, girded up
his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hakama</foreign> and fled from the precincts though no one pursued
him, feeling like one who is afraid of being caught in the fire
<pb n="64" xml:id="p88-64"/>

that he has kindled. Then the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, calling <persName>Chikugo-no-kami
Sadayoshi</persName>, cried out. "The capital is full of traitors who plot
to overthrow our house, make haste and report it to all our clan
and assemble the retainers quickly, let all hear!" Soon
<persName>Udaisho Munemori</persName>, <persName>Sammi Chujo Tomomori</persName>, <persName>To-no-Chujo
Shigehira</persName>, <persName>Sama-no-kami Yukimori</persName> and others of their kinsmen
came up in full armour with their bows on their backs, together
with a multitude of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> innumerable. That night there
assembled at the <persName>Nyudo's</persName> mansion of <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> about six
or seven thousand armed men. The next day was the first day
of the sixth month and, while it was yet dark, <persName>Kiyomori</persName> called
<persName>Abe-no-Sukenari</persName> and ordered him to proceed to the Palace of
the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, and calling <persName>Taizen-no-Taiyu Nobunari</persName>, to
say to him as follows; "There is a plot of <persName>Shin Dainagon Nari-
chika-no-Kyo</persName> and other retainers of he <persName>Ho-o</persName> to overthrow our
family and throw the empire into confusion: arrest everyone
and make enquiry; the <persName>Ho-o</persName> is evidently aware of the plot."
<persName>Sukenari</persName> immediately hastened to the Palace and, calling <persName>Nobu-
nari</persName> gave him the message. He, turning pale, straightway
went and told the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. "Ah, someone has revealed the
secret," he remarked, "but even so, how did it come out, I
wonder?" And he gave no direct answer.
</p>
<p><persName>Sukenari</persName>, immediately returning, reported this to his
master, at which the <persName>Nyudo</persName> replied that evidently <persName>Yukitsuna</persName>
had spoken the truth and that if he had not revealed the plot
their lives would have been in danger. Then he gave orders to
<persName>Chikugo-no-kami Sadayoshi</persName> and <persName>Hida-no-kami Sadaie</persName> to arrest
all who were implicated; so, taking bands of two or three
hundred horsemen, they went hither and thither and seized
them all. He also sent foot-soldiers to the mansion of the <persName>Shin
Dainagon</persName> at <placeName>Naka-no-Mikado Karasu Maru</placeName> with orders that he
should come immediately. The <persName>Dainagon</persName>, thinking that it
was not anything concerning himself, but that <persName>Kiyomori</persName> intended
to forbid the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to attack <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, though as the latter was
much enraged it would be of no avail, gracefully donned a
<pb n="65" xml:id="p89-65"/>

costume of delicate material and mounted into an elegant car,
accompanied by three of four retainers, his servants and
oxdrivers being more ceremonial than usual; only to find out soon
after that it was for the last time. When they came near to
<placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> for four or five <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign> they saw nothing but armed
men and he felt a little anxious, wondering why there were so
many, but when they arrived at the front gate and were bidden
to enter, they saw that the inside also was filled with dense
masses of soldiers. At the middle gate many fierce-looking
warriors were standing, who, when they saw the <persName>Dainagon</persName> enter,
cried out; "Shall we seize him and bind him?" Whereupon
the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, looking out from behind a curtain, replied; "There
is no necessity." So fourteen or fifteen soldiers, surrounding
him on all sides and seizing him by the hand, pulled him on to
the verandah and shut him into a small apartment. The <persName>Daina-
gon</persName>, like one in a dream, did not comprehend what was
happening. The <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who were with him, separated by
overwhelming forces, were scattered in different directions, and the
servants and ox-drivers in consternation abandoned the ox-car
and took to flight. Then <persName>Omi-no-Chujo Nyudo Renjo</persName>, <persName>Hos-
shoji-no-Shugyo Shunkwan Sozu</persName>, <persName>Yamashiro-no-kami Moto-
kane</persName>, <persName>Shikibu-no-Taiyu Masatsuna</persName>, <persName>Hei-Hangwan Yasuyori</persName>,
<persName>So Hangwan Nobufusa</persName>, and <persName>Shin Hei Hangwan Sukeyuki</persName> were
also arrested and brought in: <persName>Saiko-hoshi</persName>, on hearing this,
fearing that it was a matter concerning him also, rode in haste to
the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. On the way, however, meeting some
soldiers from <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> they accosted him, saying; “You are
required at <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, haste thither at once;" but he replied
that he had business at the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and afterwards
would do as they ordered. "What is it that you have to say
to him, O most worthless of priests?" they answered as they
dragged him from his horse and carried him bound to <placeName>Roku-
hara</placeName>. As he was the mainstay of the plot from the beginning,
they bound him firmly and put him in ward in a certain
courtyard. Then <persName>Kiyomori</persName>. standing on the verandah above, glared
<pb n="66" xml:id="p90-66"/>

at him fiercely for a while and then exclaimed; "This is the way
I treat a worthless fellow like you who makes plots against me.
Bring him here!" So they brought him to the edge of the
verandah and the <persName>Nyudo</persName> trampled on his face with his footgear,
"You, who were at first a Courtier of the lowest rank and were
advanced by the favour of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to a high office that you
did not deserve, you and your son, have behaved outrageously,
and procured the exile of the <persName>Tendai Zasshu</persName>, though he was
guilty of no offence, and not only that but you have taken part
in a plot against me and my house. Now confess the whole
thing at once and tell the truth!" But <persName>Saiko</persName>, being by nature
a bold fellow, showed no fear, and recovering himself and not at
all taken aback, replied with a laugh; "As I served as a
confidential retainer of the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Household I cannot say I took
no part in the raising of forces by the <persName>Shitsuji-no-Betto Nari-
chika-no-Kyo</persName>. Indeed I did have a hand in it. Why do you
say things that I cannot overlook? Before other people it does
not matter but in my hearing you shall not speak thus. You
are the eldest son and heir of the late <persName>Gyobu-no-Kyo Tada-
mori</persName>, and you did not enter the Court at all until you were
fourteen or fifteen years old, and then you were serving in the
train of the late <persName>To-Chunagon Kasei-no-Kyo</persName> of <placeName>Naka-no-Mikado</placeName>,
when even the children of the city called you <persName>Takaheita</persName>: but in
the period <placeName>Ho-en</placeName> you arrested three pirate leaders and were
rewarded with the fourth rank; and when you were called
<persName>Hyoe-no-suke</persName> of the fourth rank, people said it was too high a
rank for you, so it is certainly too much that, being of the line
of a men who had not the right of going to Court, you have
raised yourself to be <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName>. From old time there is
precedent for military families like mine to obtain fiefs and hold
positions in the <orgName>Kebiishi</orgName>. That is not promotion beyond one's
position." Thus he spoke out boldly without fear, and the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> could neither restrain his anger nor could he utter a
word for rage; after a while he managed to ejaculate; "Do
not take his head off now, examine him well and find out all the
<pb n="67" xml:id="p91-67"/>

plot; then away with him to the river and behead him." There-
upon <persName>Matsuura-no-Taro Shigetoshi</persName> applied torture by squeezing
his arms and legs. <persName>Saiko</persName> did not resist at all and the torture
was very severe after they had written his confession on four
or five sheets of paper, his mouth was split open by order of
<persName>Kiyomori</persName> and he was executed at <placeName>Shujaku</placeName> on the west side
of <placeName>Gojo</placeName>.
</p>
<p>His eldest son <persName>Kaga-no-kami Morotaka</persName>, who had been
dismissed from his office and banished to <placeName>Idota</placeName> in <placeName>Owari</placeName>, was now
ordered to be executed also by <persName>Oguma-no-gunshi Koresue</persName> of
that province. His younger son <persName>Kondo Hangwan Morotsune</persName>
was also taken out of prison and put to death. The third son
<persName>Saemon-no-jo Morohira</persName> together with three of his retainers lost
his head also. These men had all been raised up from humble
positions and interfered in matters in which they had no right to
meddle, procuring the exile of the innocent <persName>Tendai Zasshu</persName>, and
thus they met their fate and were overtaken by retribution as a
punishment from the deity of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>.

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>THE LESSER ADMONITION.</head>
<p>The <persName>Shin-Dainagon</persName>, being thus confined in a small
chamber, was in such a state of terror that a cold sweat broke out all
over him and he thought to himself; "Ah, this is the result of
someone letting out our secret. Who can it be that has turned
informer? It must be one of the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Palace Guards."
While he thus continued turning over everything anxiously in
his mind, he heard a loud footfall approaching from behind and
thought it was the soldiers coming to put him to death. It was
however the <persName>Nyudo</persName> himself who came tramping loudly over the
wooden floor and abruptly opened the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> of the apartment.
Dressed in a somewhat short costume of white silk and striding
along in an <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">o-kuchi-hakama</foreign>, wearing a sword without any deco-
<pb n="68" xml:id="p92-68"/>

ration loosened in its scabbard, <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, in wrathful mien, glared
fiercely for a space at the <persName>Dainagon</persName>. "You ought to have been
executed at the time of the revolution of <placeName>Heiji</placeName>, but <persName>Shigemori</persName>
saved your neck. That kindness you have forgotten. What is
your grievance that you wish to overthrow our house? To
understand gratitude is the part of a man, but he who forgets it
is merely an animal; as however our family is not yet doomed
to fall, I have had you brought here so that I my find out what
has been going on lately." "You are entirely mistaken," replied
the <persName>Dainagon</persName>," someone must have surely slandered me, so pray
make close enquiry into everything." At this <persName>Kiyomori</persName>
interrupting him called; "Ho! there;" when <persName>Sadayoshi</persName> immediately
appeared. "Bring the confession that fellow <persName>Saiko</persName> has made :"
ordered the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, and on its being produced read it through
loudly several times to the <persName>Dainagon</persName>; "Now you villain, what
have you to say to that?" he shouted, as, flinging the document
into his face, he slammed the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> to and went out.

<p>His anger
was not yet appeased however, so he called to <persName>Tsuneto</persName> and
<persName>Kaneyasu</persName> and bade them throw the <persName>Dainagon</persName> down into the
courtyard. At this they demurred saying that <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>
might not approve of such treatment.
</p>
<p>"What?" demanded <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, "do you regard the orders
of <persName>Shigemori</persName>, and pay no attention to mine? It seems I can do
no more." But they, thinking it inadvisable not to obey after
all, seized the <persName>Dainagon</persName> by both his hands and threw him down
into the courtyard. Then the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, exulting in his revenge,
ordered them to throw him to the ground and beat him till he
cried out, whereupon the two, wishing to spare him, whispered
into the <persName>Dainagon's</persName> ear that he should cry out quickly, and so
threw him down and he cried out several times. It looked just
like a scene in the <placeName>Meido</placeName> when those who have sinned in this
<pb n="69" xml:id="p93-69"/>

<placeName>Shaba-world</placeName> are tortured by the devils after being weighed in
the balance and their misdeeds examined in the mirror of clear
crystal. Thus in <placeName>China</placeName> also <persName>Sho</persName> and <persName>Han</persName> were thrown into
prison, and <persName>Kan</persName> and <persName>Ho</persName> were slain with their families to the
third generation; <persName>Choso</persName> also was executed and <persName>Shug</persName> was
punished: of these men the first four were all loyal subjects of
the <persName>Emperor Koso</persName>, but through the slanders of worthless fellows
they were innocently disgraced.
</p>
<p>On this misfortune happening to the <persName>Shin-Dainagon</persName> his first
thought was about the fate of his son <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho Naritsune</persName>
and the other younger children. As it was now the sixth month
it was extremely hot, and as he could not loosen his dress of
ceremony, his condition became unbearable so that he gasped
for breath and sat bathed in tears and sweat. Though he
thought that <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName> would not forsake him, there was
none to bring him any tidings.
</p>
<p>After some hours had passed, <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>, undisturbed
as usual either by good or ill, arrived at <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> with his
eldest son <persName>Gon-no-suke Koremori</persName> riding at the back of his car.
He had four or five guards in attendance and two or three
retainers but no military escort, and his bearing was entirely
calm and unmoved. The <persName>Nyudo</persName> and his family were somewhat
surprised to see him come thus, and on his alighting at the middle
gate <persName>Sadayoshi</persName> came forward and said; "Why do you go
without an armed escort seeing that the times are so critical ? "
"Critical is a word that should only be used of the affairs of
the nation," replied the Minister, "we cannot use it of our own
private quarrels." On hearing this the crowd of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who
stood by armed to the teeth looked somewhat uncomfortable.
<persName>Shigemori</persName> then proceeded to search through many rooms to
find where the <persName>Dainagon</persName> had been confined, and at last came to
a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> over which was an arrangement of beams and ropes like
a spider's web. Ordering these to be removed he discovered
the <persName>Dainagon</persName> within. He, sitting choked with tears did not at
first look up, but on being greeted kindly by <persName>Shigemori</persName> his face
<pb n="70" xml:id="p94-70"/>

lighted up like that of a sinner in Hell who sees the approach of
<persName>Jizo Bosatsu</persName>. "I know not what is the reason," he said, "but
this morning I have fallen into this evil plight; as however you
have deigned to come to me, I am not without hope that you
will be able to deliver me. When in the period of <placeName>Heiji</placeName> I was
about to be executed, it was your compassion that saved my life,
and since then I have advanced to be <persName>Dainagon</persName> and obtained
the second Court Rank, being scarcely more than forty years
old. Although I can never repay your kindness, I pray you
to save my worthless life once more. If that be granted I will
retire from the world, and entering the way of Buddha retire to
some hamlet far remote, where I may give my whole mind to
attain enlightenment as a Buddha in the future life." "Even
so" replied <persName>Shigemori</persName>, "I think they will not go so far as to
put you to death, and should they wish to do so, I myself will
go surety for your life, so set your mind at ease." Then seeking
out his father <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, he addressed him thus; "I pray you
consider most carefully what you do in putting the <persName>Dainagon</persName> to
death, for since his ancestor <persName>Shuri-no-Taiyu Akisue</persName>, who was
Courtier of the <persName>Retired Emperor Shirakawa</persName>, he has been the only
one of his family to be promoted to <persName>Dainagon</persName> of the upper
second rank he is, besides, extremely high in favour with his
master the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, wherefore it is not good to put him to death.
It will be quite sufficent to expel him from the capital. <persName>Kitano
Tenjin</persName>, owing to the slander of the <persName>Minister Tokihira</persName>, spent his
remaining days in sorrow and exile across the western sea, and
the <persName>Minister Nishi-no-miya</persName>, owing to the traduction of <persName>Tada-no-Manchu</persName>, spent his days in bitterness amid the misty mountains
of the <placeName>Sanyo</placeName>, both being innocent of any crime. All this was
during the righteous era of <placeName>En-ki</placeName>, and tradition calls it the
injustice of the Mikado of <placeName>An-wa</placeName>; so if even in great antiquity
such things happened, how much more in an evil age like this?
Even a wise ruler makes mistakes; how much more an ordinary
person. Since you have already arrested him, there is no more
cause for anxiety, even if you spare his life.
</p>
<pb n="71" xml:id="p95-71"/>

<p>The Chinese sages have said; "Give the benefit to the
accused where guilt is in question, but give him the credit
where merit is in question." Moreover, to consider another side
of the matter, I have married the younger sister of this <persName>Dainagon</persName>,
while my son <persName>Koremori</persName> has married his daughter, and being
bound by such intimate ties, perhaps you may think that is the
reason I speak thus. That however is not the case, but it is for
the sake of the Emperor, of our country, and of the time, that I
entreat you.
Remember what an extreme measure it was
considered when the late <persName>Shonagon Nyudo Shinsei</persName>, when he was
regent, revived the death sentence, which had not been imposed
since <persName>Uhyoe-no-kami Fujiwara Nakanari</persName> was condemned to death
in the time of <persName>Saga Tenno</persName> twenty-five generations ago, and had
the body of <persName>Uji-no-Akusafu</persName> (<persName>Sadaijin Yorinaga</persName>) dug up and the
head cut off and though people may have said in old times
that, if the ringleaders were executed, rebels would cease out of
the land, yet, only two years after <placeName>Hogen</placeName> there was the rebellion
of <placeName>Heiji</placeName>, when the body of <persName>Shinsei</persName> which had been buried was
dug up and the head cut off and exposed; truly a salutary
example that the deed which he did in <placeName>Hogen</placeName> should so soon
be paid back on his own head. Now as this man is not a rebel
against the throne, you ought to hesitate to put him to death.
I do not think that our family is at the summit of its prosperity
yet, but I hope that its present glory will continue for many
generations: yet, as the good or evil acts of the sires are visited
on their descendants, we see that "the accumulation of good
deeds produces happiness whereas misfortune waits at the gate
of him who piles up evil ones." So at all events he must not be
beheaded this evening." So the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, admitting the
reasonableness of this speech, gave up the intention of executing him.
</p>
<note type="footnote">Give the benefit etc. From the <title>R.</title></note>
<p>Then <persName>Shigemori</persName> went out to the middle gate and thus
addressed the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>; "You must by no means put the <persName>Dai-
nagon</persName> to death even if you are ordered to do so, for when the
<pb n="72" xml:id="p96-72"/>

<persName>Nyudo</persName> is angry he is apt to do rash things which he afterwards
regrets; so do not make mistakes that you will be sorry for
afterwards." At these words all the men-at-arms trembled with
apprehension. <persName>Shigemori</persName> continued; "this morning <persName>Tsuneto</persName> and
<persName>Kaneyasu</persName> treated the <persName>Dainagon</persName> harshly and violently: this was
a very ruffianly deed; why did they not fear lest I should hear
of it? Rustic <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> are all of this kind." Then <persName>Namba</persName> and
<persName>Seno</persName> also quaked with fear, while <persName>Shigemori</persName>, having thus
admonished them, returned again to the <placeName>Komatsu</placeName> Palace.
</p>
<p>The retainers of the <persName>Dainagon</persName> had hurried back to their
lord's mansion at <placeName>Naka-no-Mikado-no-Karasu-Maru</placeName>, and related
all that had passed, whereupon their mistress and her ladies
lifted up their voices and wept. Then the retainers, telling them
of the arrest of the heir and other younger members of the
family, advised them to hide themselves quickly. "Having
come to this," replied the wife of the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, "even if we
live unmolested, what hope have we for the future? All that I
wish now is to die with my husband like dewdrops that melt on
the same evening. Alas! that I did not know that this morning's
meeting would be our last." And casting her clothes about her
she threw herself on the ground in despair. After a while
however, as there was a rumour that the soldiers of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
were approaching, and not wishing them to behold her wretched
condition, taking a daughter of ten years old and a boy of eight
with her, she got into her carriage and fled away, going she
knew not whither. As she could not continue thus without any
aim, going up to <placeName>Omiya</placeName> and reaching the <placeName>U-rin-in</placeName>, a temple on
the northern hills, she alighted before one of the buildings, when
those who had so far accompanied her, fearing for their lives,
took leave of her and returned again to the city. What a sad
plight it was for her, left with only these young children, and
with no one to help her with sympathy or advice. As she saw
the shades of night falling, and reflected that her lord's life might
pass away like the dew that very evening, she wished that she
too might give up the ghost.

At the <persName>Dainagon's</persName> mansion many retainers and ladies were
left, but they were too apprehensive even to take any food and
did not so much as shut the gates, and though there were many
horses in the stables there was none who gave them any food.
Formerly from early dawn there would be rows of carriages at
the gate and innumerable guests coming to spend the day
in dancing and merriment, as though the cares of life did not
exist, while their inferiors who approached them dared not so
s               much as raise their voices in their presence. This haughty state
continued until yesterday, but in one short night all was
changed. How are the mighty brought low! Now can we appreciate
the saying of <persName>Ko-sho-ko</persName>," Pain comes when pleasure is at its
height."

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5" xml:id="v2_ch5">
<head>CHPTER V.</head>
<head>THE SHOSHO IS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE SAISHO,</head>
<p><persName>Tamba-no-Shosho Naritsune</persName> stayed that night in the <placeName>Hojuji-
den</placeName>, the Palace of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, and did not go out at all.
The retainers of the <persName>Dainagon</persName> hurriedly rode up to this Palace and
summoned him forth, and on their relating the arrest of his father
to him, he replied; "Why did not the <persName>Saisho</persName> (Chief Minister)
inform me of an affair like this until now?" But hardly had he
finished speaking when a messenger arrived from the <persName>Saisho</persName>. Now
this <persName>Saisho</persName> was the younger brother of <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, and his
mansion was by the outer gate (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kado-no-waki</foreign>) of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, so that
he was called <persName>Kadowaki-no-Saisho</persName>; and he was the father-in-law of
<persName>Tamba-no-Shosho</persName>. "I know not the reason," said the messenger,
"but I have been ordered by <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> to bring you thither
at once." On hearing this the <persName>Shosho</persName> summoned the
ladies-inwaiting who always attended him and said; "Last night I heard
<pb n="74" xml:id="p98-74"/>

some uproar outside and thought it might be the priests of the
mountain coming down into the city; but it seems to be
something connected with my affairs. As the <persName>Dainagon</persName> is to be put
to death this evening, I also shall be included in the same
condemnation: I should like to visit the <persName>Ho-o</persName> once more, but as this
misfortune has happened to me, I must refrain." The ladies
then went to the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and reported the matter to him. The
<persName>Ho-o</persName>, understanding from <persName>Kiyomori's</persName> messenger that morning
that the secret plot had been revealed, intimated that he wished
the <persName>Shosho</persName> to visit him, whereupon the latter did so. The <persName>Ho-o</persName>
weeping said nothing, while the <persName>Shosho</persName>, also choked by tears,
was silent likewise. So, after a short space, he retired from the
Presence and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> saw him off at some distance, saying;
"How sad is this degenerate age! This is the last time I shall
see him :" and he could not restrain his tears. When the <persName>Sho-
sho</persName> retired from the presence of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, all the Courtiers and
Court Ladies were much grieved at parting with him, pulling
him by the sleeves and shedding tears, so that no one was
dryeyed.
</p>
<note type="footnote"><persName>Ko-sho Ko</persName>. <persName>Oe Tomotsuna</persName>. The whole verse runs: Those who
live must die; even <persName>Buddha</persName> cannot escape the smoke of the
sandalwood; when pleasure is at its height comes pain; even the angels have
their five failings.</note>
<p>When he arrived at the house of his father-in-law the <persName>Saisho</persName>
he found that his wife was just on the eve of her confinement,
and that, as the result of the shock of the morning's upset, it
seemed as if she were about to expire. Now since his departure
from the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Palace he had not ceased to weep, and now,
seeing the condition of his wife, he gave way completely to his
despondency. Also the milk-nurse of the <persName>Shosho</persName>, named
<persName>Rokujo</persName>, came to him in tears and said; "Since I came here as
nurse I have brought up my lord until now, and since I brought
him up I did not grieve at my increasing years but only rejoiced
at seeing my lord grow up; and though not yet quite full
grown he has this year attained the age of twenty-one. Never for even
half-an-hour have I been parted from him; when he went to the
Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> I was always anxious if he came back late,
and now at last what misfortune has he met with ?" Then the
<persName>Shosho</persName> tried to comfort her, assuring her that as the <persName>Saisho</persName> was
<pb n="75" xml:id="p99-75"/>

there he would most probably escape with his life; but she
would not be consoled and gave herself up to violent weeping
in spite of the presence of other people. Meanwhile several
messengers came from <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> and the <persName>Saisho</persName> decided
that there was nothing to be done but to go, whatever might
happen, and started forthwith, the <persName>Shosho</persName> taking his seat at the
back of his car. Since the age of <placeName>Hogen</placeName> and <placeName>Heiji</placeName> the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
family had nothing but prosperity, and no misfortune came their
way, save only to this <persName>Saisho</persName> who suffered through his unhappy
son-in-law.
</p>
<p>When they came to the <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> mansion and
enquired what they were to do, they were told that the <persName>Shosho</persName> must
not enter within the gate, so leaving him in the care of some
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>, the <persName>Saisho</persName> entered by himself. Then <persName>Kiyomori's</persName> men
surrounded the <persName>Shosho</persName> on all sides and guarded him strictly,
and being thus parted from the <persName>Saisho</persName> on whom he so much
relied, his heart failed him and he felt very forlorn.
</p>
<p>The <persName>Saisho</persName> went in to the middle gate but the <persName>Nyudo</persName> did
not come out to meet him, so after a while he sent word by
<persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Suesada</persName> saying; "I much regret that I
am related to this troublesome fellow but it cannot be helped;
his wife is now ill and this morning misfortune has fallen upon
him so that she is now at the point of death: if he is in my
hands I will not permit him to do anything improper, so I pray
you give him into my charge for the present." When <persName>Suesada</persName>
reported this to the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, <persName>Kiyomori</persName> only answered; "This
unfortunate <persName>Saisho</persName> has no discrimination", and gave no decision
about the request. Some time afterward however he said to
<persName>Suesada</persName>; "The <persName>Shin Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> and other
Imperial retainers intended to destroy our house and disturb the
peace of the land, and this <persName>Shosho</persName> is the eldest son of this man.
Whether he is deeply implicated in it or not I cannot overlook
it. If this rebellion had been carried out would you have been
likely to be unharmed?" When the <persName>Sajsho</persName> heard this he looked
entirely crestfallen and replied; "Since <placeName>Hogen</placeName> and <placeName>Heiji</placeName> I have
<pb n="76" xml:id="p100-76"/>

many times risked my life in battle on your behalf and hereafter
also I will ward off from your person the strong wind of
adversity. Though I am an old man I have many young children
and they too may become a strong protection, yet when I ask
you this one thing namely to put the <persName>Shosho</persName> in my charge, you
do not willingly accede. That must be because you think that
I too have some treasonable design. If I am thus doubted it is
of no use my living any longer in the world, so I will retire and
become a monk, dwelling in seclusion in <placeName>Koya</placeName> or <placeName>Kogawa</placeName> and
praying earnestly for a rebirth in a better world. Verily the
relationships of this world are of no avail: when one is in the
world one has hope, but when the object of hope cannot be
attained, spite arises: nothing is better than, despising this
fleeting world, to enter the way of Buddha." Then <persName>Suesada</persName>
repeated to <persName>Kiyomori</persName> the words of the <persName>Saisho</persName>, adding that his mind
seemed to be made up and begging the <persName>Nyudo</persName> to grant his
request. "Truly it would be a foolish thing for him to retire
from the world, so I will place the <persName>Shosho</persName> under his charge;"
replied <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, and <persName>Suesada</persName> returned and informed the <persName>Sai-
sho</persName>.
</p>
<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "it is not good to take the
responsibility for the child of another; if he was not thus related to
my daughter I should not be so distressed:" and he went out.
The <persName>Shosho</persName> who was waiting for him enquiring how the matter
had gone, he replied; "The <persName>Nyudo</persName> was very wrath and would
not receive me, repeating that he would not grant my request,
but when I threatened to become a monk, then he consented to
put you in my charge; but I fear it is only for a time." "Then
I shall at any rate obtain a reprieve for a while by your favour,"
replied the <persName>Shosho</persName>, "and, by the way, have you heard aught
of the fate of my father the <persName>Dainagon</persName>?" "Truly" answered
the <persName>Saisho</persName>, "I could only put in a word on your behalf, I could
certainly go no further." Thereupon the <persName>Shosho</persName>, bursting into
tears; “I fear for my own life, it is true, but how much do I wish
to see my father again; this night the <persName>Dainagon</persName> is to be put to
<pb n="77" xml:id="p101-77"/>

death, so what use for me to live longer? I wish to share my
father's lot whatever it may be, so do you please inform the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> of my desire." The <persName>Saisho</persName>, much troubled at this
prospect, replied; "I spoke of your affair indeed, but farther
than that I did not go; I have heard however that <persName>Shigemori</persName>
the <persName>Naidaijin</persName> advised his father this morning not to put him to
death, so probably his circumstances will not be so
unfavourable." Without waiting to hear any more the <persName>Shosho</persName> clasped his
hands together and wept for joy. Who but a child would be
able to forget all anxiety for himself and thus rejoice at his
father's safety? Indeed the strongest bond of relationship is that
of father and child. How necessary a thing it is to have children.
Then the <persName>Saisho</persName> and the <persName>Shosho</persName> returned to the mansion of the
<persName>Saisho</persName> in the same carriage just as they had gone forth: and
the ladies-in-waiting and the retainers wept and rejoiced on their
arrival as over those who have come back from the dead.

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>THE ADMONITION.</head>
<p>The Lay-priest Chancellor, though he had had so many people
arrested, still seemed unsatisfied. Coming forth to the middle
gate of his mansion with a menacing aspect, he called in a loud
voice for <persName>Sadayoshi</persName>. He was dressed in a red embroidered
'<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign>' worn over a black suit of armour with the breast-plate
ornamented with silver, and gripped under his arm the short
halberd with silver-mounted handle that he had received many
years before from the god of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> when he was favoured
with a divine message in a dream, while he was yet only known
as <persName>Aki-no-kami</persName>, and which he always kept by his pillow.
</p>
<p><persName>Chikugo-no-kami</persName> straightway stood before his lord: he
was attired in '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign>' of yellowish red hue and his armour
was of scarlet. "What do you think, <persName>Sadayoshi</persName>? In the period
of <placeName>Hogen</placeName>, <persName>Taira Uma-no-suke Tadamasa</persName> and more than half our
family came to the help of the <persName>Newly-Retired Emperor</persName> (<persName>Sutoku</persName>
<pb n="78" xml:id="p102-78"/>

<persName>Tenno</persName>) and <persName>Ichi-no-miya</persName> (<persName>Shigehíto Shinno</persName>) was the adopted
son of the late <persName>Gyobu-no-Kyo Tadamori</persName> my father, so that it
was most difficult for me not to support him; in spite of these
things however, following the instructions of the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
(<persName>Toba Tenno</persName>), I assisted the party of the Emperor (<persName>Go-Shiraka-
wa Ho-o</persName>). This was one service that I did for the Imperial
House. Then at the time of the rebellion of <persName>Nobuyori</persName> and
<persName>Yoshitomo</persName> in the twelfth month of the first year of <placeName>Heiji</placeName>, when
the Palace was seized and the Court entered, the country
therefore falling into disorder, at the risk of my life I drove out the
rebels and arrested <persName>Tsunemune</persName> and <persName>Korekata</persName>. Many times
therefore have I put my life at the disposal of the Imperial Court,
so that whatever people may say against us the Imperial House
ought not to forsake our family even to the seventh generation.
Still the <persName>Ho-o</persName> has listened to such a pair of worthless rascals as
<persName>Narichika</persName> and <persName>Saiko</persName>. This plan of destroying us, which the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> seems inclined to, must by no means be carried out. I
suppose that hereafter, if any accuse us falsely, the Emperor is
likely to issue a mandate for our destruction, and if we are once
proclaimed enemies of the Emperor, however much we regret
it, we cannot redeem ourselves again. Formerly for a time until
the country was quiet again the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was removed to the <placeName>North
Palace of Toba</placeName>; what then do you think about bringing him
here to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> now? If this be done perhaps some of the
Imperial Guard may make armed resistance; so order our
retainers to make ready, I will serve the <persName>Ho-o</persName> no longer. Saddle
my horse and bring out my general's armour!"
</p>
<p>Then <persName>Shume-no-Hangwan Morikuni</persName> rode hard to the
mansion of <persName>Shigemori</persName> and hurriedly told him what was
happening. Without waiting to hear all the <persName>Naidaijin</persName> exclaimed ; "Ah,
now they have taken off the head of <persName>Narichika-no-Kyo</persName>." "That
is not so " replied <persName>Morikuni</persName>, "but the <persName>Nyudo</persName> has assumed his
general's armour and is going to lead his retainers to the <persName>Ho-o's</persName>
Palace at <placeName>Hojuji</placeName>, declaring that until peace be restored he will
remove the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to the <placeName>North Palace of Toba</placeName>, or if not will
<pb n="79" xml:id="p103-79"/>

bring him to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>; but we think his real intention may be
to banish him to the western confines of the country." Then the
<persName>Naidaijin</persName>, doubting if this was really so, but judging from his
father's demeanour of the morning that he was quite beside
himself, hastily got into his car and proceeded to <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName>.
</p>
<p>When he alighted at the gate and entered, he saw the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> in his body-armour with scores of Courtiers and nobles
of his family all in armour and '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign>' of various descriptions
and colours, sitting in two rows along the verandah by the
middle gate, besides a crowd of provincial lords and bodyguards
and officials of all ranks overflowing into the courtyard beneath :
their standards were marshalled and their horse-girths and
helmet-thongs tightened so that they looked as it immediately
about to set forth.
</p>
<p><persName>Komatsu dono</persName>, clad only in '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">naoshi</foreign>', with his '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hakama</foreign>'
of large pattern girt up, and an '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">eboshi</foreign>' on his head, entered
with a peaceful rustle of his silk garments, making a striking
contrast to them all. <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, casting down his eyes in
embarrassment, thought in his heart; "Ah, how calmly does
this minister deport himself as one detached from the world; it
seems I must rebuke him :" still, even though it was his own
son, in the presence of one who kept the Five Prohibitions and
did not offend in the matter of the Five Virtues, who was
charitable, courteous and polite in all his dealings, he felt ashamed to
be found in warlike attire, so, slightly closing the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign>, he drew
on hastily over his armour a white priestly garment, the bosom
of which he continually pulled together to conceal the shining
metal of the breastplate.
</p>
<p>The <persName>Naidaijin</persName> then took his seat one above that of his
younger brother <persName>Munemori</persName>, neither he nor the <persName>Nyudo</persName> saying
anything. After some time the silence was broken by his father.
"A rebellion of <persName>Narichika</persName> is a thing of no account, but this
affair has been planned by the <persName>Ho-o</persName>," said he," so what do you
think about bringing him to the <placeName>North Palace of Toba</placeName>, or if not,
making him proceed hither until matters have quieted down?
<pb n="80" xml:id="p104-80"/>

Not waiting to hear any more the <persName>Naidaijin</persName> burst into tears."
"What is the matter then?" enquired the <persName>Nyudo</persName> in surprise ;
whereupon <persName>Shigemori</persName>, repressing his tears, replied. “If I am
to judge by your words I must suppose that the prosperity of
our house is drawing to its close, for it is when people are on the
downward path that they always commit some crime. Your
appearance in this guise seems to me but as an illusion, for
though this our land is a remote and narrow realm, yet since
under the sovereignty of the descendants of <persName>Ama-Terasu-Omi-
Kami</persName> the stock of <persName>Ama-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto</persName> have administered
it, those who have held the office of <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> have never been
accustomed thus to appear in warlike attire. Moreover you, a
lay-priest, putting off the garments sacred to the Buddhas of the
three worlds that are the garb of those who are liberated from
the passions, do suddenly assume armour and gird on bow and
arrows, thus not only transgressing the Five Prohibitions and
being guilty of shameless crime, but disregarding entirely the
Five Virtues. It is not pleasant to speak thus, but I cannot hold
back what is in my mind. In this world there are four
obligations, that to Heaven and Earth, that to the Emperor, that to
Father and Mother, and that to one's fellow men, and of these
the most important is that to the Emperor. All the land is the
Emperor's dominion; we know the example of those two sages
in <placeName>China</placeName>, he who washed his ears in the waters of <placeName>Ei-sen</placeName> and
he who ate the braken on the mountains of <placeName>Shuyo</placeName>, how they
teach the difficulty of opposing the Emperor. How much more
must it be so with one who has advanced to the high office of
<persName>Dajo-daijin</persName>, from a family in which such an office is without
precedent? I too, an ignorant and stupid person, have become
minister, and more than half the country is subject to our
ordinances. Is not all this the reason for a rare obligation to
the Emperor? But you, unmindful of all this great obligation,
are about to treat the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> person in a violent manner, a
</p>
<note type="footnote">Liberated from the passions. <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">gedatsu</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Sk. Vimokcha</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Mukti</foreign>.</note>
<pb n="81" xml:id="p105-81"/>

<p>thing quite contrary to the will of <persName>Hachiman</persName> and <persName>Ama-Terasu</persName>.
<placeName>Nippon</placeName> is the land of the Gods and the Gods will not permit
discourtesy. Thus the Emperor's plans cannot be without
reason. That our house has for several generations subdued
the foes of the Emperor and pacified the angry waves of the
four seas may be indeed great patriotism, but to boast of it is
only inconsiderate to others. In the seventeen articles of the
constitution of <persName>Shotoku Taishi</persName> it is written; "Every man has a
mind, and every mind has self-will; some say one thing is
good and some another, so who can decide which is right? There
is wisdom and folly in both, it is like a circle having no end;
this being so, when one is angry he must first condemn himself."
But as the fall of our house is not yet destined this plot has
already been revealed: moreover we have already taken <persName>Nari-
chika</persName> into custody, so there is no need for anxiety about
anything the Emperor may do; after suitably punishing these people
you must explain the matter to the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. Thus serving the
Emperor and cherishing the people with sympathy you will
receive the protection of the gods and not disobey the will of
<persName>Buddha</persName>: if you are favoured by the gods and <persName>Buddha</persName>, the
Emperor will change his opinion of us: if I compare the Empe-
ror and yourself, there is no distinction between the affection I
have for both, but when comparing what is right and what is
wrong one must of necessity prefer the right. Since then right
is on the side of the Emperor, I will protect the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Palace
to the best of my ability, seeing that my having risen to my
present high position of <persName>Daijin-no-Taisho</persName> from a low rank is
entirely due to the Imperial favour. When I consider the
greatness of this favour, it is more than ten thousand times ten
thousand clusters of jewels, yea deeper than the double-dyed purple,
Therefore I must go to the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Palace, and my <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who
have vowed to lay down their lives for me at any time will
doubtless go with me; and if I gather them together and go to
protect the <placeName>Hojuji-den</placeName>, a great crisis will come about. How
unhappy am I! For if I remain loyal to the Emperor I must
<pb n="82" xml:id="p106-82"/>

forget the gratitude I owe to my father, which is higher than the
peaks of <placeName>Mt. Meiro</placeName>. Verily my path is a hard one; for if I
avoid unfilial conduct then I shall be a rebellious subject and
undutiful to the Emperor. I know not which way to take, for
it is difficult to decide on one or the other. I beseech you then,
order me to be beheaded, for then I can neither go with you
against the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, nor can I be on his side to protect him. In
<placeName>China</placeName> <persName>Shoka</persName> attained merit beyond ordinary men and became
Prime Minister, being permitted to attend at the Court wearing
shoes and with his sword girt on, but on one occasion he was
disobedient, and the <persName>Emperor Koso</persName> punished him severely.
Considering this precedent, even if a man attain to great wealth,
rank and prosperity, Imperial favour and the highest office, it is
not so difficult to fall. If a wealthy and noble house like ours
accumulate stipend and rank too easily it is like a tree that bears
too much fruit and is injured in its roots. Alas! I care to live
no longer to see my country in such disorder. Born in a
degenerate age to encounter such misfortunes, what an evil destiny
indeed! How easy it would be to order one of your <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>
to take me out into the courtyard there and strike off my head.
Consider these things all of you!" And wiping his tears with
the sleeve of his '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">naoshi</foreign>', he wept bitterly, and all the <orgName>Heike</orgName>,
as they sat row upon row, lifted up their voices and wept also.

<p>The <persName>Nyudo</persName>, hearing <persName>Shigemori</persName>, in whom he put all his
trust, speak thus, felt his heart fail him, as he answered; "Indeed
I have never even contemplated such a thing, but I only fear as
to what may happen if the <persName>Ho-o</persName> adopt the plans of these rascals."
"Whatever mistake may be perpetrated," replied the <persName>Naidaijin</persName>,
"how can we lift a hand against the <persName>Ho-o</persName>? Then, suddenly
standing up in the middle gate, he addressed the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>; "I think
<pb n="83" xml:id="p107-83"/>

you have heard everything that I have said: I was present from
this morning and tried to calm this disturbance, but it is beyond
my power, so I must return home; do not march against the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> while my head is on my shoulders!" Then calling his
retainers he returned to the <placeName>Komatsu-den</placeName>. On arriving there
he summoned <persName>Shume-no-Hangwan Morikuni</persName> and instructed him
thus; "I have this morning learned that the country is in a
critical condition, so let those who consider themselves dutiful
retainers arm themselves and follow." At this all thought that
such a summons from one usually so little moved by rumour
must be of great import and hasted to obey. The retainers
came pouring out from the villages of <placeName>Yodo</placeName>, <placeName>Hatsukashi</placeName>, <placeName>Uji</placeName>,
<placeName>Okanoya</placeName>, <placeName>Hino</placeName>, <placeName>Kwanjuji</placeName>, <placeName>Daigo</placeName>, <placeName>Ogurusu</placeName>, <placeName>Mamezu</placeName>, <placeName>Katsura</placeName>,

in the stirrup and some with neither, so great was their haste and
disorder. Now when they heard of the activity at the <placeName>Komatsu-
den</placeName>, the horsemen, who were at <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> to the number of
several thousand, hastened thither without the knowledge of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName>, so that not a single warrior was left in the household.
<persName>Chikugo-no-kami</persName> who alone remained was summoned by <persName>Kiyo-
mori</persName>: "Why has <persName>Shigemori</persName> called away everyone thus, can it
be that he intends to attack me as he said this morning?"
<persName>Sadayoshi</persName> weeping replied; “Such things depend on a man's
character; he is not likely to do it, for he will already regret
what he has said here this morning." <persName>Kiyomori</persName> however thought
that it was not advisable to fall out with his son the <persName>Naidaijin</persName>,
so he modified his violent intentions towards the <persName>Retired Empe-
ror</persName>. Hurriedly stripping off his armour, he donned the robe
and scarf of a priest and betook himself to his prayers, which,
however, by no means arose from his heart. Meanwhile at the
<placeName>Komatsu-den</placeName> <persName>Morikuni</persName> was ordered to make a roll of the
retainers who had mustered, and it was found that their number
was more than ten thousand horsemen. After inspecting this
muster-roll, <persName>Shigemori</persName> came forth to the middle gate and thus
<pb n="84" xml:id="p108-84"/>

addressed the assembled <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>. "I am greatly moved at your
rallying here so quickly without regard for your own affairs.
In <placeName>China</placeName> there is an example of this kind; <persName>Yu-o</persName> of the <orgName>Shu</orgName>
dynasty had a favourite consort named <persName>Ho-ji</persName>, and she was the
greatest beauty in the kingdom, but in one thing she did not
please <persName>Yu-o</persName>; she never laughed, never at all did she even smile.
Now it is the custom in <placeName>China</placeName> that when a rebellion breaks out
in the army they light beacon-fires and beat drums to
assemble the soldiers, and it happened that a revolt took place
at this time so that the beacons were lighted; and when this
consort saw them she exclaimed; "Oh! what a lot of them there
are," and smiled for the first time. And when she smiled her
expression was very winsome, and <persName>Yu-o</persName> was highly delighted,
so that many times after he had beacons lighted without any
special reason, and when the generals came and found there was
no revolt they had nothing to do but to go away again. This
happening many times, at last they did not even come, and then
it chanced that an enemy from a neighbouring country made a
raid and attacked the capital of <persName>Yu-o</persName>, but though he had
beacons lighted, thinking it was only for the consort's amusement,
no soldiers responded, so that the capital fell and <persName>Yu-o</persName> himself
was killed: whereupon the consort changed herself into a fox
and ran away.
This being so, whenever I summon you, come
hither quickly as you have done today, for I called you together
because this morning I heard that there was a great crisis, but
afterwards when I investigated more fully I was convinced that
the report was mistaken: so you may return again to your
quarters." On this the retainers retired. Now it seems that
<persName>Shigemori</persName> had not really believed that there was any crisis, but
after rebuking his father that morning he wished to find out
whether the soldiers would be on his side or not, and that he
did not intend to attack <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, but only used this device to
prevent any inclination on his part of interfering with the Em-
peror. As <persName>Confucius</persName> has said; "even if the Emperor does not
behave as Emperor, the subjects must behave as subjects; and
<pb n="85" xml:id="p109-85"/>

even if a father does not behave as a father, a son must behave
as a son: loyalty to the Emperor is like filial piety in a son."
When the <persName>Ho-o</persName> heard of these things, he exclaimed: “It is
not the first time that I feel ashamed to face the <persName>Naidaijin</persName>, for he
repays enmity with kindness." His contemporaries also praised
him, declaring that it was a most fortunate thing that such a man
had become <persName>Daijin-no-Taisho</persName> who was superior to all in courtesy
and etiquette, beside being supreme in intellect and ability. "If
there is a minister who dares to advise the Emperor, then the
country will be at peace; and in the family if there is a son who
advises his father, that house will stand firm. Happy is the
country that has such a minister both in ancient and modern
times."

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>THE EXILE OF THE SHIN-DAINAGON.</head>
<p>On the second day of the sixth month they brought forth
the <persName>Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> into the reception chamber
of the mansion and entertained him with a repast, but his heart
was too full even for him to touch a morsel. Then his guard
<persName>Namba-no-jiro Tsuneto</persName> ordered his car and bade him enter it,
whereupon the <persName>Dainagon</persName> reluctantly did so. He expressed a
wish to see <persName>Shigemori</persName> once more, but unhappily was not
permitted to do so. Looking round on the escort that surrounded
him, he could not see one of his own men, "Ah," he exclaimed,
"even one exiled for a great crime ought to be allowed at least
one of his own retainers." When the guards heard this their
tears flowed even on to their sleeves of mail. Thus going along
the west side of the <placeName>Shujaku</placeName> to the southward, he only saw the
buildings of the Court from a distance, who had so long been in
attendance there, whereat everyone even to the servants and
oxdrivers he knew so well buried their faces in their sleeves and
wept. How much more sad must be the state of his wife and
children left behind in the city, On passing by the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>,
<pb n="86" xml:id="p110-86"/>

he called to mind how he always accompanied the <persName>Ho-o</persName> when
he visited there. Farther on he saw his own country seat;
<placeName>Suhama</placeName>, in the distance. Passing out through the south gate of
<placeName>Toba-den</placeName>, they hurried to take the ship. He then expressed
the wish that he might at least be executed at a place like this
that was near the capital. On enquiring the name of the retainer
who was to accompany him, the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> told him it was <persName>Nam-ba-no-jiro Kaneyasu</persName>. Then the <persName>Dainagon</persName> asked if any of his
own retainers were present, as he had something to say before
he embarked, but when <persName>Tsuneto</persName> went round and searched,
there was not one to be found. Then the <persName>Dainagon</persName> weeping
exclaimed; “Ah, in the time of my prosperity I had two or
three thousand retainers, but now there is not one who comes to
see the last of me even from afar off;" whereat the rough
soldiers were again moved to moisten the sleeves of their armour.
A copious flood of tears indeed was all that followed him.
Formerly when he went to visit the shrines of <placeName>Kumano</placeName> or <placeName>Ten-noji</placeName>, he used to go in a state barge of great magnificence
accompanied by twenty or thirty other ships, but now he had to
embark on a rough vessel with nothing but a large tent on it,
escorted by strange soldiers, and today as he leaves the capital
for the last time, to sail far off across the sea, his wretched
feelings can only be imagined. It was only owing to the urgent
pleadings of <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName> that his death sentence was
lightened to one of exile. That day they reached the coast of <placeName>Daimo-
tsu</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>. The next day, that is the third,
a messenger from <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> came hurrying to this place, whereupon
the <persName>Dainagon</persName> thought he was to he executed there, but the
messenger had only brought news that he was to be exiled to
<placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>. There was also a letter from <persName>Shigemori</persName> in
which was written; "I had thought to get you sent to some
country place near the capital, but alas, it cannot be; so I have
no further use for this world: however I have at least managed
to save your life, therefore set your mind at ease." To <persName>Namba-no-jiro</persName> he also sent a message, adjuring him to pay great respect
<pb n="87" xml:id="p111-87"/>

to his charge and to take care not to oppose his wishes, adding
also directions in detail about preparations for the journey. Ah!
whither does he go, leaving the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to whom he owes so much,
and parting from his wife and children who have never left his
side before even for a moment? Never again will he return and
see his family. Once before at the appeal of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> he had
been exiled, but the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, taking compassion on him, recalled
him again from <placeName>Nishi Shichijo</placeName>: so his present punishment was
not by the Imperial will. "Why has this happened?" he
gasped, looking up to heaven and down again to earth:
however much he wept it was in vain. As soon as the dawn came
the ship put out and as they journeyed he did nought but weep
and seemed not to wish to survive any longer: still his fleeting
life did not come to an end. As the white waves dropped away
in their wake the capital receded farther and farther. As the
days went by one after another, the distant goal came nearer and
nearer. When they arrived at <placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, they brought
him to a rude farmer's house roofed with brushwood; the
mountains were behind him and the sea before, for it was an
island; the sounding waves and pine breeze on the shore,
everything gave him a sad and lonely feeling.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8" xml:id="v2_ch8">
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>THE PINE OF Akoya.</head>
<p>The <persName>Shin Dainagon</persName> was not the only person who was thus
punished, for many of his companions suffered likewise. It was
decided that <persName>Omi-no-Chujo Nyudo Renjo</persName> should be banished to
<placeName>Sado</placeName>, <persName>Yamashiro-no-kami Motokane</persName> to <placeName>Hoki</placeName>, <persName>Shikibu-no-taiho
Masatsuna</persName> to <placeName>Harima</placeName>, <persName>So Hangwan Nobufusa</persName> to <placeName>Awa</placeName>, and
<persName>Shinkei-no-Hangwan Sukeyuki</persName> to <placeName>Mimasaka</placeName>. At this time the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> was staying at his villa at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>. On the twentieth
day his messenger <persName>Settsu-no-kami Morizumi</persName> reached the <placeName>Kado-
waki</placeName> mansion, the residence of the <persName>Saisho Taira Norimori</persName>, and
ordered him to bring quickly <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho</persName> whom he had
<pb n="88" xml:id="p112-88"/>

in charge as he intended to do something in regard to him. To
this the <persName>Saisho</persName> replied; "It is very sad that I should again be
grieved about this; it had been better that something had been
done before:" but he bade the <persName>Shosho</persName> hasten to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> :
The <persName>Shosho</persName> started on his way weeping, and his wife and
ladiesin-waiting begged him to ask for the <persName>Saisho's</persName> good offices once
more, since all else was unavailing. "As for me, I have said all
I can," replied the <persName>Saisho</persName>," there is nothing else left for me but
to forsake the world. What can I say more? Anyhow to
whatever place you may be sent I will come and see you as long as
I live." Now the <persName>Shosho</persName> had a child of three years old, but
as he was himself young, he had not paid any special regard to
his children; now however when he found himself in this
situation they became somewhat dear to him and he thought that he
would like to see him once more. The milk-nurse therefore
brought him, and the <persName>Shosho</persName>, taking him on his knee, stroked
his hair and wept. "Alas, when you were seven years old I
wished to bring you into the Imperial Household, but now that
is all in vain. If by chance you should live to grow up you
must become a priest and pray for my happiness in a future life.”
The child naturally could not comprehend these words, but
when his father finished speaking, he nodded his head, so that
the <persName>Shosho</persName> and the child's mother, beside the milk-nurse and
others who were in attendance, even the most unfeeling, were
fain to burst into tears.
</p>
<p>The messenger from <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> bade him start for <placeName>Toba</placeName> that
evening, but the <persName>Shosho</persName> asked that, as he had not long to stay,
at least he might stop that night in the capital: this was not
however permitted and so, abandoning hope, he went to <placeName>Toba</placeName> that
night. The <persName>Saisho</persName> was so grieved that he did not accompany
him, and on the twenty-second of the same month he arrived at
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, whereupon the <persName>Nyudo</persName> gave orders to <persName>Seno Taro
Kaneyasu</persName> who dwelt in <placeName>Bitchu</placeName> to take him to that province.
<persName>Kaneyasu</persName>, fearing that the <persName>Saisho</persName> would hear of it, did not treat
him at all harshly but was very kind to him on the way. The
<pb n="89" xml:id="p113-89"/>

<persName>Shosho</persName>, in spite of this refused to be comforted, but night and
day called on the name of <persName>Buddha</persName>, praying and interceding for
his father.
</p>
<p>Now the <persName>Shin Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> was yet in <placeName>Kojima</placeName>
of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, but as this was considered to be an unsuitable place,
being near to a port, he was removed to the village of <placeName>Niwase</placeName> on
the confines of <placeName>Bizen</placeName> and <placeName>Bitchu</placeName> and lodged in a mountain
temple named <placeName>Ariki-no-Bessho</placeName> in <placeName>Kibi-no-Nakayama</placeName>, so that he
was not more than fifty <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign> distant from <placeName>Seno</placeName> in <placeName>Bitchu</placeName> where
the <persName>Shosho</persName> was, and the <persName>Shosho</persName> yearned toward that quarter for
tidings of his father. Calling <persName>Kaneyasu</persName> therefore, he enquired of
him how far it was to <placeName>Ariki-no-Bessho</placeName>, but <persName>Kaneyasu</persName>, thinking it
was not wise to inform him, told him that it was twelve or
thirteen days journey. The <persName>Shosho</persName> weeping replied; "Of old
<placeName>Nippon</placeName> had thirty-three provinces and now it is divided into
sixty-six, so that what is now called <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, <placeName>Bingo</placeName> and <placeName>Bitchu</placeName>
were formerly all one country: <placeName>Dewa</placeName> and <placeName>Mutsu</placeName> in the eastern
quarter also formed one province consisting of sixty-six districts,
but now twelve districts of it have been separated and called
<placeName>Dewa</placeName>. When <persName>Sanekata Chujo</persName> was banished to <placeName>Mutsu</placeName> and wished
to see the famous pine of <placeName>Akoya</placeName>, he went round the whole
province, but was returning again without having found it, when
he met on the road an old man whom he addressed as follows;
"I see you are an old man, so can you tell me where the pine of
<placeName>Akoya</placeName> in this province may be?" "It is not in this province'
replied the old man, "but in the province of <placeName>Dewa</placeName>." "Then
you do not know where it is either;" replied the <persName>Chujo</persName>; "in
this evil age people even forget the famous places in their own
province;" and he was making to pass on,.when the old man
caught his sleeve and said; "When you asked for the pine of
<placeName>Akoya</placeName> in this province, you were thinking of the verse :
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Hid by the Akoya pine that stands in the province of</l>
<l>Mutsu; though the moon would rise, yet its beams cannot appear."</l>
</lg>
<p>But those lines were written when the two provinces together
<pb n="90" xml:id="p114-90"/>

were known by the one name; when the twelve districts were
divided from it they were given the name of <placeName>Dewa</placeName>." So
<persName>Sanekata Chujo</persName> went to the province of <placeName>Dewa</placeName> and saw the pine
of <placeName>Akoya</placeName>. "From <placeName>Dazaifu</placeName> to <placeName>Tsukushi</placeName>," continued the <persName>Shosho</persName>,
"is only a fifteen days' journey for the courier who carries fish
to the Emperor, so that fifteen days' journey from here will take
one as far as <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, will it not? Even at the farthest the
distance between two places in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, <placeName>Bitchu</placeName>, and <placeName>Bingo</placeName> cannot
be more than a three days' journey, and that you thus call near
far is only because you will not tell me where my father the
<persName>Dainagon</persName> is lodged." After this, though still longing to see
him, he asked about him no more.

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>THE DEATH OF THE SHIN DAINAGON.</head>
<note n="GRC">Something is off. There is no chapter 9 and we have two instances of Chapter 11. I have changed this chapter 11 to chapter 10.</note>
<p>Meanwhile <persName>Hoshoji-no-Shugyo Shunkwan Sozu</persName>, <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho Naritsune</persName>, and <persName>Hei Hangwan Yasuyori</persName> were all exiled
to the island of <placeName>Kikai-ga-shima</placeName> in the bay of <placeName>Satsuma</placeName>. This is a
place that can only be reached from the capital after many
hardships and the crossing of stormy seas. It is a place that
even sailors cannot find unless quite certain of the way, and it
is an island in which few men live. There are some people there
it is true, but as they wear no clothing, they are not like ordinary
folk of the mainland; neither can they understand our language.
Their bodies are covered with hair and black like oxen, and the
men do not wear '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">eboshi</foreign>' neither do the women have long hair.
As they have nothing else to eat they must kill animals for food;
they do not cultivate the fields and so have neither rice nor corn,
nor do they grow mulberry trees, aud so are lacking in silk.
In this island there is a high mountain that burns with eternal
fire and the land is full of sulphur, so that the island is also called
<placeName>Io-ga-shima</placeName> (Sulphur Island). Thunder rolls continuously up
and down the mountain and at its foot rain falls in abundance. It
is not possible for anyone to live there for a moment.
</p>
<p>The Shin</p>
<pb n="91" xml:id="p115-91"/>

<p><persName>Dainagon</persName> was feeling more calm in his mind now, but hearing
that his son <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho Naritsune</persName> was exiled to <placeName>Kikai-ga-
shima</placeName> in <placeName>Satsuma</placeName> bay with two others, thinking that there was
now nothing more to wait for, he informed <persName>Shigemori</persName> by
messenger of his desire to shave his head and become a priest; and
this being reported to the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, he also gave his assent. Thus
putting off the bright-sleeved dress of prosperity, he forsook this
fleeting world and came down to wear the black costume of a
recluse.
</p>
<p>Now the <persName>Dainagon's</persName> wife, having retired to the vicinity of
<placeName>Un-rinji</placeName> in the northern hills, not only found such an
unaccustomed life grievous to her, but had nothing to occupy her
days and so felt extremely miserable. In her former residence
she had had many ladies-in-waiting and retainers, but now they
were either afraid or ashamed to visit her, all except one
retainer named <persName>Gensaemon-no-jo Nobutoshi</persName>, who took pity on
her and came to see her continually. One day she called this
<persName>Nobutoshi</persName> and addressed him thus; "My lord has been so far
staying at <placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, but lately I have heard that he has
been removed to <placeName>Ariki-no-Bessho</placeName>. Ah! how much I should like
to send a letter to him and to receive an answer in return."
"Since I was a child," replied <persName>Nobutoshi</persName>, bursting into tears,"
how many are the benefits I have received from you, and never
yet have I been parted from you. Your commands I have always
obeyed and I have always heeded your advice. When my lord
went down to the western province I would have accompanied
him, but <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> would not allow it, and so I could not, but
now whatever hardships I may encounter I will surely bear your
august message to him." His mistress was overjoyed at these
words and forthwith wrote the letter. Her little son and
daughter also wrote a message, and <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> taking them
proceeded to go down to <placeName>Ariki-no-Bessho</placeName> in the far-off province of
<placeName>Bizen</placeName>. Making enquiries of the guard <persName>Namba-no-jiro Tsuneto</persName>,
that warrior, respecting his dutiful conduct, soon brought him to
where his lord was. His master the <persName>Dainagon Nyudo</persName>, now, as
<pb n="92" xml:id="p116-92"/>

always, occupying himself with sadly musing about his home in
the capital, on seeing <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> arrive from <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, hardly
understanding whether it was dream or reality, sprang up and
bade him enter immediately. <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> advanced, but on
seeing the condition of his lord, his lowly dwelling and his black
priestly garments, his heart sank within him and he could not
restrain his tears. Then, controlling himself somewhat, he
related all that his lady had said to him, and presented the letter.
The <persName>Dainagon</persName>, on opening it and seeing the writing all blurred
with tears, and reading how much his children sorrowed for
him, not to speak of his wife's unbearable grief and anxiety, felt
that his former longing was as nothing to his present anguish.
</p>
<p>Thus four or five days passed and <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> requested that
he might stay with his master till the end; but this the soldier
who guarded him could by no means allow, and the <persName>Dainagon</persName>
himself dissuaded him saying; "As you cannot stay any longer
please return at once; I feel that my end will not be long in
coming and when you hear of my death I beg you pray for my
welfare in the world to come." So <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> received an
answer to his letter and took his leave, promising to come again
soon. “Ah,” replied the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, "I think there will be no
need for that: you will never see me again;" and in his grief
and regret at parting, he called <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> back again and again;
but as there was nothing else to be done, the retainer, restraining
his grief, returned again to the capital and delivered the letter to
his lady. When she opened it she immediately perceived his
change of state, for inside the packet there was a lock of his hair
that he had shaved off. She could read no farther but
exclaiming: "Ah! how grievous is such a memento!" covered her
head and threw herself to the ground. Her children also lifted
up their voices and wept aloud.
</p>
<p>Now on the nineteenth day of the eighth month of the same
year the <persName>Dainagon</persName> was at last put to death at <placeName>Ariki-no-Bessho</placeName> in
<placeName>Kibi-no-Nakayama</placeName> in the village of <placeName>Niwase</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Bizen</placeName>. And of the manner of it, it is said that first they put
<pb n="93" xml:id="p117-93"/>

poison in his wine, but as this had no effect, planting tridents in
the ground under a cliff about twenty feet high, they pushed
him over it and he was pierced through by them so that he died.
What a pitiful death it was! When his wife heard of his death
she exclaimed; "Until now I have not changed my condition
and become a nun because I thought I might see him again,
but now it is of no avail;" and retiring to a temple called <placeName>Bodai-
in</placeName>, she became a nun and devoted herself to a religious life.
</p>
<p>Now this lady was the daughter of <persName>Yamashiro-no-kami Atsu-
kata</persName>, and she had been loved by the <persName>Ho-o Go-Shirakawa</persName>, being
of exceeding great beauty; and as this <persName>Dainagon</persName> was beloved by
the <persName>Ho-o</persName> she had been given to him afterwards. So his young
sons and daughters passed their days bringing flowers and
drawing water for the offerings to <persName>Buddha</persName> and praying for the
welfare of their father in the world to come. And thus the
events of the time went on changing just like the five changes of
the angelic beings.
</p>
<note type="footnote">Five changes, or degenerations. These were supposed to be; first
withering of the flowers on their head; second, sweating under the
armpit; third, extinction of their halo; fourth, becoming blind; fifth,
becoming dissatisfied with their place in heaven.</note>

<head>THE TOKUDAIJI DAINAGON GOES TO ITSUKUSHIMA,</head>
<p>Now as the <persName>Tokudaiji Dainagon Sanesada-no-Kyo</persName> was
passed over by <persName>Taira Munemori</persName>, the second son of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>,
in the matter of the office of <persName>Taisho</persName>, he retired from his office of
<persName>Dainagon</persName> and lived in seclusion, watching to see what turn
things might take; but when he was inclined to become a priest,
all his house grieved and lamented greatly. Among them was
one who had the title of <persName>Shodaibu</persName>, <persName>To Kurando-no-Taiyu Shige-
kane</persName> by name, a man capable in all matters. One moonlight
night <persName>Tokudaiji Dono</persName> had his lattice drawn up on the south side
and was singing to the moon, when this <persName>To-no-Kurando</persName> came
<pb n="94" xml:id="p118-94"/>

up to him. "Who is there?" enquired the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, "<persName>Shige-
kane</persName>" was the answer. "It is now moonlight, what is your
purpose in coming here?" "Tonight the moon is very clear
and so I have come to calm my spirit by contemplating it.”
"It is most admirable that you have come," replied the
<persName>Dainagon</persName>, “for tonight I feel melancholy beyond measure and
the hours are very tedious." After a while, when they had
spoken of various things both present and past, the <persName>Dainagon</persName>
said; "Consider the prosperity of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>; the eldest son
<persName>Shigemori</persName> and the second son <persName>Munemori</persName> have become generals
of the right and left; and still there is the third son <persName>Tomomori</persName>
and the grandson <persName>Koremori</persName>: if both of these take their turn, it
does not seem as if anyone of another family will ever become
<persName>Taisho</persName> at all. That is the end of things for me. I will become
a recluse." <persName>To-no-Kurando</persName> weeping replied; "If you become
a monk all of your family will be without anyone to guide them.
I have lately thought of a novel plan: you know that <placeName>Itsukushi-
ma</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName> is exceedingly revered by the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family. Do
you go and visit it. In that shrine there are many elegant
dancing-girls who have the title of '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Naishi</foreign>' or Imperial
ladies-inwaiting, and they will entertain you in a most interesting way.”
"But what shall I pray for?" enquired the <persName>Dainagon</persName>. “Tell
them the real state of affairs,” replied <persName>Shigefusa</persName>," and when you
leave, bring one or two of the chief of these <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Naishi</foreign> back with
you to the capital, and then they will certainly go and pay a
visit at <placeName>Nishi-Hachijo</placeName>, and when the <persName>Nyudo</persName> asks the reason,
they will relate the whole circumstances to him, and as he is
easily interested in such things it will be a very suitable occasion
to obtain his favour." "I had not thought of such a thing,"
replied the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, "but I will certainly act on your advice
immediately:" and straightway he purified himself and set out
for <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName>. On his arrival there he found that there were
indeed many beautiful dancing-girls there, and they declared
<pb n="95" xml:id="p119-95"/>

that though the <orgName>Heike</orgName> lords were accustomed to visit the shrine,
other courtiers seldom came, and so his pilgrimage was very
interesting to them. So ten of the principal <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Naishi</foreign> kept him
company continually day and night and entertained him very
agreeably. When these <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Naishi</foreign> enquired the reason of his
coming, he replied that it was because he had been passed over in
the appointment to the office of <persName>Taisho</persName> in favour of another
person, and had come to pray about it. So he tarried there
seven days, and they performed the sacred music and dance
called <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kagura</foreign> as well as many local sacred songs and dances,
while the entertainment called <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Bugaku</foreign> was given three times.
Then, when he started on his return journey, the ten chief <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Naishi</foreign>
prepared boats and went with him a day's journey to see him
off, and <persName>Tokudaiji</persName>, regretting to part with them, first persuading
them to come another day, and then two, at last brought them
right to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, and taking them to his mansion, entertained
them splendidly and made them many presents. The <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Naishi</foreign>,
declaring that as they had come from such a distant place to the
capital they must certainly visit their patrons the <orgName>Heike</orgName> lords,
proceeded to <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> with that purpose. The <persName>Nyudo</persName>,
who came forth and received them, enquired for what reason they
had journeyed all the way to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, whereupon they explained
that <persName>Tokudaiji Dono</persName> had visited their shrine, and that having
prepared ships and decided to come with him one day's journey,
to see him off and then to return, he had persuaded them to
come farther and farther until at last they had come to the
capital with him. Then the <persName>Nyudo</persName> asked why <persName>Tokudaiji</persName> had
gone to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName>, and they told him that it was to pray about
being passed over in the election to <persName>Taisho</persName>. Hearing this the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> nodded his head and said to himself; "How admirable
a thing it is that he has made a pilgrimage to the distant shrine
of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> that I revere above all others, instead of going to
the many influential and potent shrines and temples in the capital.
If his desire is so earnest, then I will see." So he made <persName>Shige-
mori</persName> the <persName>Naidaijin</persName> retire from the office of <persName>Sadaisho</persName> and elevated
<pb n="96" xml:id="p120-96"/>

<persName>Tokudaiji Dono</persName> to it in his place over the head of his second
son <persName>Munemori</persName> the <persName>Udaisho</persName>. What a clever device this was
indeed! How sad that the <persName>Shin-Dainagon</persName> did not adopt such
a plan as this instead of making a useless rebellion which led to
the destruction of himself and his descendants.

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>THE DESTRUCTION OF HIEIZAN.</head>
<p>Now the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, having become the disciple of <persName>Kogen Sojo</persName>
of <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, was studying the esoteric doctrines of <orgName>Shingon</orgName>: and
having read the three secret Sutras called <title>Dai-nichi Kyo</title>,
<title>Kongo-cho-Kyo</title> and <title>So-shitsuji-Kyo</title>, on the fourth day of the
ninth month was to undergo the ceremony of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kwancho</foreign> or
Baptism. When they heard this the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> were
wrath and said; "From ancient days it has been the custom
that the ceremony of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kwancho</foreign> should be performed by our
temple, and it is for the especial purpose of admonishing and
baptizing the Emperor that our god manifests himself in this
mountain. If therefore the ceremony is to be performed at
<placeName>Miidera</placeName> there is nothing for it but to burn our useless temple.
Therefore the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, considering his idea unprofitable, gave up
his intention of receiving <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kwancho</foreign>, and only requested that the
purification ceremony be carried out. But in order to carry out
his original intention, he summoned <persName>Koken Sojo</persName> and went to
<placeName>Tennoji</placeName> where he built a temple called <placeName>Gochiko-in</placeName>, and decided
on the well of <placeName>Kame-i</placeName> as his sacred water of baptism. Then,
finishing his study of the Sutras, he received baptism at the
original sacred spot of Buddhism in <placeName>Japan</placeName>. But though the
<pb n="97" xml:id="p121-97"/>

<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kwancho</foreign> was not performed at <placeName>Miidera</placeName> in order to pacify the
wrath of the monks of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, yet at that temple differences of
opinion between the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Doshu</foreign> (lay brothers) and the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gakusho</foreign>
(student priests) led to pitched battles between them in which
the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gakusho</foreign> were defeated; so that the destruction of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>
and a great disaster to the Imperial family seemed likely. These
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Doshu</foreign> were either youthful attendants on the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gakusho</foreign> who had
become priests, or else priests who did menial work in the
temples, and at the time when <persName>Kakujin Gon-Sojo</persName>, the <persName>Zasshu</persName> of
<placeName>Kongo-ju-in</placeName> was the head of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, they were called <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Geshu</foreign>
and lodged in the three pagodas, being employed in offering the
flowers before the Buddhas. Of late years however they were
called <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gyonin</foreign>, and, setting at nought the higher priests, they
got the upper hand by force. So when these <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Doshu</foreign>,
disobeying the orders of the higher priests, planned a revolt, their
superiors appealed to the Court nobles for an order to punish
them and asked the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> to carry the order into execution.
Then the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, at the order of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, sent <persName>Yuasa-Gon-no-
kami Muneshige</persName> of the province of <placeName>Kii</placeName> with about two thousand
men of the <placeName>Kinai</placeName> district to attack the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Doshu</foreign> in cooperation
with the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Taishu</foreign> or upper priests. Now the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Doshu</foreign> were at this
time lodging in the building called <placeName>Toyobo</placeName>, but when they
heard of this they came down to <placeName>Sanga-no-shorin Omi</placeName> and
gathered a large force with which they returned to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, where
they built a fortification at <placeName>Sobisaka</placeName> and took up their position
in it. On the twentieth day of the ninth month and the first
part of the hour of the Dragon (8 a.m.), three thousand of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Tai-
shu</foreign> or upper priests with two thousand men of the Imperial army,
five thousand in all, made an attack on <placeName>Sobisaka</placeName>, shouting their
war-cry vigorously. Those in the fort however shot arrows and
cast stones upon them so that their united forces were shot down
to a man. As the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Taishu</foreign> tried to get before the Imperial forces
while the Imperial army strove to outstrip the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Taishu</foreign>, this vying
with each other divided their councils and they were not able to
fight effectively. Moreover the band of ruffians who composed
<pb n="98" xml:id="p122-98"/>

the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Doshu</foreign> were made up of thieves, brigands, mountain robbers
and pirates, all consumed with a lust for booty and fighting each
for himself, reckless whether they lived or died; so that on this
occasion also the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gakusho</foreign> had the worst of the battle.

<p>After this <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> gradually fell into dilapidation. Except
the twelve branches of the <orgName>Zen</orgName> sect, few priests were left to live
there; the lectures in the valley were gradually abolished, the
religious ceremonies were performed no more, the academies of
learning were closed, and the floor for <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Zen</foreign> meditation became
deserted. No longer was the flower of the <orgName>Tendai</orgName> fragrant, and
the moon of its clear doctrines was clouded. There was none
to light the sacred lamps that had never gone out for three
hundred years; the smoke of the perpetual incense ceased. No
longer do the vast buildings tower aloft, cleaving the blue heavens
with their three-storied bulk, with their crossbeams of
immeasurable height and their rafters that are scarcely discerned amid
the white mists. The Buddhas are adored but by the mountain
blasts; their golden statues are wetted by the muddy raindrops:
the moonbeams streaming through the chinks of the roof are
their sacred lamps, and their lotos seats are encrusted with the
diamond dew of dawn. In this unhallowed and degenerate age
the Buddhist Law that was supreme in the three countries
declined. Consider the remains of Buddhism in far-off <placeName>India</placeName>; the
<placeName>Chiku-rin Shoja</placeName> and the <placeName>Gitsu-kodoku-on</placeName>, where of old the Law
was preached, are they not the haunt of wolves and foxes, their
foundations alone remaining? The waters of the lake of <placeName>Hakuro</placeName>
have dried up and the tall grasses have grown up within it.
The <placeName>Taibon</placeName> and <placeName>Gejo</placeName> pillars are moss-covered and leaning to
their fall. In <placeName>China</placeName> also <placeName>Tendaisan</placeName>, <placeName>Godaisan</placeName>, <placeName>Hakubaji</placeName> and
<placeName>Gyokusenji</placeName> are now dilapidated and forsaken, and the sacred

volumes of the <title>Mahayana</title> and <title>Hinayana</title> are rotting at the bottom
of their boxes. In our country too the seven great temples of
<placeName>Nara</placeName> are laid waste: the eight sects, yea the nine have left no
race, Of old at <placeName>Atago</placeName> and <placeName>Takao</placeName> the sacred halls and pagodas
raised on high their ranging roofs, but in one night they were
utterly ruined and became a place for <persName>Tengu</persName> to dwell in. So
also may it not be that the noble law of <orgName>Tendai</orgName> has been
abolished in this era of <placeName>Jisho</placeName>? There were none among the men of
understanding who did not fail to lament it. Who wrote it we

<head>THE PETITION OF YASUYORI.</head>
<p>Now the three who were exiled to <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName> did not

<persName>Yasuyori</persName> also managed to support themselves from it. More-
over <persName>Yasuyori</persName> on being exiled on his way had become a priest at
<placeName>Murozumi</placeName> in <placeName>Suwo</placeName>, and was henceforth known by the religious
name of <persName>Shōshō</persName>. He had originally intended to do this before,
so he made this couplet :
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Now that the way of the world has gone so entirely
against me;</l>
<l>How very foolish I was not to have left it before."</l>
</lg>
<p>As <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho</persName> and <persName>Yasuyori</persName> had always been
believers in the god of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, they wished to build a temple to
supplicate the three <persName>Gongen</persName> in this island that they might be
delivered and return to the eapital. <persName>Shunkwan</persName>, however, being
by nature a sceptic, took no part in it at all. So the two, being
agreed, went round the island searching for a place like to
<placeName>Kumano</placeName>. One spot they found with a wooded bank, its cliff
covered with creepers like red embroidery; another a wondrous
peak hidden in the clouds with variegated scenery below it like
green damask outspread, the mountain landscape and splendid
groves surpassing all they had so far seen. Looking to the
southward the sea spread out far as the eye could reach, its
distant waves dissolving into clouds and mist. Northward from
the lofty precipice a waterfall leaped out a hundred feet down
with an eternal roar of sound. Since the age of the gods the
wind had sounded in the pines. It was a spot that greatly
resembled <placeName>Nachi</placeName> with its waterfall sacred to the <persName>Gongen</persName>. So they
gave it the name of the mountain of <placeName>Nachi</placeName>, and the peaks they
also named <placeName>Hongu</placeName> and <placeName>Shingu</placeName>, giving the names of the different
gods to various places. Then <persName>Yasuyori Nyudo</persName>, taking <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho</persName> with him, went round them every day after the style

went on, having no change of clothes, they put on hempen ones,
and purifying themselves in the water of the marsh, they feigned
it to be the pure streams of <placeName>Iwata</placeName> in <placeName>Kumano</placeName>; climbing up a

recited the sacred '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">norito</foreign>," having no paper for '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">gohei</foreign>' he

Thy goodness is boundless as the lofty mountains and thy pity

suffer the dews beneath. How should we tread these rough

grace and incline thine all-hearing ears to listen; behold our
burning zeal and grant all our petitions. Guide when in need
those who are enlightened in the Law and save those who are yet
in ignorance; leaving thy jewel abode and hiding thy eighty
four thousand beams of light, show thyself in the dust of the Six
Ways and the Three Regions. Earnestly we lift up our hands
together in prayer for the removal of retribution of our sins in a
former existence and for the required blessing of long life,
waving the '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">gohei</foreign>' without intermission, clad in the garments of
purification and offering the flowers that symbolise knowledge
of the way, making the sacred floor to vibrate with our zeal, and
offering pure water with earnest mind that it may fill the lake
from which flow thy benefits. Thus mayest thou receive our
petition aud fulfil all our desires. Thus looking upward we
petition the twelve <persName>Gongen</persName>, that with salvation in their wings,
soaring over the sky of this Sea of Pain, they may restore us to
our former rank, and speedily and at a near time grant our
petition to return to our homes."

pened that one night when they had thus stayed until morning
singing '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Imayo</foreign>' and dancing, toward dawn they allowed their
eyes to close for a moment with weariness, and in a dream they
saw a small ship with white sails rowing in from the offing, and
twenty or thirty court ladies in scarlet <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hakama</foreign> coming on shore
from it, beating drums, and chanting in chorus, "Better than
prayer to ten thousand Buddhas is the vow to <persName>Kwannon</persName> of the
Thousand Hands; straightway the withered herbage will put
forth flowers and fruit." Repeating this chant three times they
vanished. Then <persName>Yasuyori Nyudo</persName>, awaking from his dream,
thought it a wondrous sign: indeed it must have been sent by
the Dragon God; for seeing that one of the Three <persName>Gongen</persName> of
<placeName>Kumano</placeName> called <persName>Nishi-no-Gozen</persName> was the <persName>Kwannon</persName> of the Thous-
and Hands in <placeName>India</placeName>, and the Dragon God of the sea is one of the
twenty eight servants of this <persName>Kwannon</persName>, no doubt they would
obtain their desire.
</p>
<p>Another night the two spent there also, and in a dream
they saw two leaves blown in by a breeze from the offing and
wafted into their sleeves, and when they looked at them, lo!
they were leaves of the '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nagi</foreign>' tree at <placeName>Kumano</placeName>. On the leaves
of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nagi</foreign> these lines had been bitten in by insects:
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Since your prayers to the god have been so long and
incessant ;</l>
<l>Snrely you are allowed soon to return to your home."</l>
</lg>
<p>So much did <persName>Yasuyori</persName> desire to return that as one method
of consoling himself he made a thousand '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Sotoba</foreign>' and wrote on
them the character <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">A</foreign> in Sanscrit, with the day of the month
and his name and priestly name, adding these stanzas also :
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"That I am here in an isle of the bay of Satsuma dwelling ;</l>
<l>Prithee O salt sea breeze, tell to my parents afar." and:</l>
<l>"Dear is his native land to him who is not so far distant ;</l>
<l>Feel then more pity for me, exiled so lone and so far."</l>
</lg>

reverenced by Buddhists, especially by the <orgName>Shingon</orgName> sect.</note>
<pb n="105" xml:id="p129-105"/>

<p>Then taking them down to the shore he cast them into the
white sea waves one by one with this invocation : "<foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Namu
Kimyo chorai</foreign>, O <persName>Shaka Nyorai</persName> and Four Great Heavenly
Kings and Ye Gods of Heaven and Earth, and all the deities
who protect this Imperial land, especially the <persName>Gongen</persName> of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>
and the deity of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName>. May it please you to
grant that one of these may reach the capital." As he went on
making them and casting them into the sea thus, as the days
passed the number of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sotoba</foreign> increased with them, and
whether the winds assisted him or the gods and Buddhas sent it,
one of the thousand <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sotoba</foreign> was cast up on the shore before the
shrine of <persName>Itsukushima Daimyojin</persName>. It chanced moreover that a
priest who had some connexion with <persName>Yasuyori Nyudo</persName> had just
come to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in the course of a pilgrimage to the western
part of the country, and this priest had the intention of going to
the island if he could find occasion, to enquire the whereabouts
of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>. There a servant came out from the shrine
dressed in a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign> and looking like an ordinary person, and in the
course of their talk the priest said: "It is true that the gods
appear in the world in divers guises to save mortals, but in what
connexion does the god of this place appear as a sea dragon?"
"Because the third daughter of the Dragon King of <placeName>Shakatsura</placeName>
is manifested here as <persName>Taizokai</persName> (the mandara of wisdom)," replied
the shrine servant. (Since the goddess appeared in this place
she has continued to help mortals until the present day and many
miraculous events have taken place, so that these eight shrines
stand raising their lofty roofs by the sea-shore, the moon shining
on the ebbing and flɔwing tide: when the tide flows the great
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">torii</foreign> and the red shrine-fence shine like emerald, and at the
ebbing tide even in the summer night the sand before it is covered
with frost.)

<pb n="106" xml:id="p130-106"/>

<p>Then the priest, wondering at these marvels, offered gifts to
the shrine with peace of mind, and as the moon rose and the tide
came in at dusk he saw the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sotoba</foreign> come floating among the
seaweed that drifted in from the offing, and idly picking it up he
saw the verse upon it, and as the characters were cut in the wood
they were not washed off by the waves but stood out clearly.
Thinking this very strange, he stuck it on the side of his
pilgrim's box and went back to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>. On arriving there he
showed it to the old mother of <persName>Yasuyori</persName> and his wife and
children who were living in retirement at <placeName>Murasakino</placeName> north of <placeName>Ichijo</placeName>.
"Ah!" they said sadly, "why should this have come here,
instead of going across to <placeName>China</placeName> which lies nearest, to renew our
grief by the sight of it?" Then the matter came to the ear of
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, and when he looked on it he exclaimed, weeping:
"Ah, how cruel that the wretched man should still be living."
It was sent on by him to <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>, and he in turn sent it
to his father.
</p>
<p>Of famous verses there is the stanza that <persName>Kaki-no-moto
Hitomaro</persName> made about 'the ship disappearing among the islands,'
thinking fondly of his native land, and that of <persName>Yamabe-no-Aka-
hito</persName> in like case celebrating 'the storks among the reeds.' So
the god of <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName> also spoke of 'the shingled roof of his
shrine,' and the <persName>Miojin</persName> of <placeName>Miwa</placeName> of 'the cedar trees of his shrine
gate,' when afar from his home. Since <persName>Susa-no-o-no-mikoto</persName>
first made the verse of thirty one syllables, even the gods and
Buddhas have thus expressed their feelings in it.

<p>Now the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, being neither wood nor flint, was touched
and felt pity, and there was none in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> among high or low,
old or young who did not murmur the stanzas of the exiles of
<placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>, and even though they had made a thousand
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sotoba</foreign>, they were very small things, so that it was very wonder-
<pb n="107" xml:id="p131-107"/>

ful that the verses should be carried all the way to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> from
the far distant shore of the bay of <placeName>Satsuma</placeName>.
</p>
<p>When one comes to consider the matter, there was also an
example of this kind in old time in <placeName>China</placeName>. When formerly the
king of <placeName>Han</placeName> made war on the barbarians, <persName>Ri-sho-kei</persName> was first
made general and led an army of three hundred thousand
horsemen, but his forces being the weaker, the barbarian army
conquered, and <persName>Ri-sho-kei</persName> was taken alive by the barbarian
king. Then <persName>Sobu</persName> set out against them with five hundred
thousand horsemen, but again his army proved the weaker and
the barbarians were victorious, capturing six thousand prisoners
and amongst them <persName>Sobu</persName> himself. Selecting six hundred and
thirty of the most important of these, they cut off one of the
legs of each and let them go. Of these some died immediately
and others some time afterward, and <persName>Sobu</persName> was the only one who
survived. Having only one leg, he managed to keep himself
alive by eating the fruit of the trees on the mountains and by
plucking the '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">nezeri</foreign>' berries in the fields or by picking up the
gleanings of the rice-fields in autumn. So long did he do this
that the wild geese that abounded in the rice-fields ceased to
have any fear of him, and looking on them and meditating sadly
that they would fly over his beloved native land, at last he
wrote his thoughts on paper, and having caught one of them,
he tied the massage to its wing, and, earnestly praying it to bear
the document to the king, let it go. Faithfully enough, as was
its wont, the wild goose flew over from the south to the capital,
and as <persName>Sho king of Han</persName> chanced to be walking in the Imperial
garden, and feeling somehow rather sad, was gazing at the
dusky twilight sky, a line of wild geese came soaring overhead,
and one of them, flying low, bit off a letter from one of its wings
and let it fall, An official immediately picked it up and brought
<pb n="108" xml:id="p132-108"/>

it to the king who opened it and read as follows: "Having
spent the first three months of the year in a cave in the rocks,
now I am cast forth wandering among the narrow paths between
the rice fields, a survivor with one leg among the northern
barbarians. Even though I leave my dead body in the
barbarian country, yet shall my spirit surely again serve my Em-
peror." (Now this is the reason why, since that time, a letter
is often called '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gansho</foreign>' or '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gansatsu</foreign>,'' goose-script' or 'goose-
note!) "Ah! how pitiful,' said the king, "<persName>Sobu</persName> is still alive;
how praiseworthy is this intimation." Then he sent out an
army of a million horsemen under the general <persName>Ri-ko</persName> and this
time the forces of <placeName>Han</placeName> were victorious and the army of the
barbarians was routed. On hearing of the victory, <persName>Sobu</persName> came
crawling along out of the fields and proclaimed his name and
title. With his one leg, and aged by the frosts of nineteen
winters, he was borne in a litter to his former country. When
he had set out against the barbarians at the age of sixteen he had
wrapped round his body the banner presented to him at that
time by the Emperor, and now taking it off again he presented
it once more in the Imperial presence, whereat both Emperor
and subjects were filled with admiration beyond measure. As
a reward for his great and meritorious conduct <persName>Sobu</persName> received
a grant of large territories from the Emperor, and was raised to
the high office of <persName>Ten-shoku-koku</persName>.
</p>
<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nezeri</foreign>. <rs type="botanicalname">Oenanthe Stolonifera</rs>.</note>
<note type="footnote"><persName>Sho</persName>., <persName>Sobu</persName> was captured in the reign of <persName>But</persName> and came back
in the sixth year of <persName>Sho</persName>. The story here differs somewhat from the
Chinese histories.</note>
<p>Now <persName>Ri-sho-kei</persName> stayed in the barbarian country and did
not return, and though he did nothing but lament and try to
find a way of getting home, the barbarian king would not permit
him and so he could do nothing. The <persName>king of Han</persName> however
had no idea of this, and thought that <persName>Ri-sho-kei</persName> was a disloyal
subject, so he had the dead bodies of his parents dug up and
beheaded, while his six nearest relations, father, mother, elder
and younger brothers, wife and son, were all treated as
criminals. When <persName>Ri-sho-kei</persName> heard of this he was extremely grieved,
and writing a letter in which he stated that he was by no means
disloyal, but ardently desired to return to his country, he sent
<pb n="109" xml:id="p133-109"/>

it to the <persName>king of Han</persName>. The king having read it, exclaimed:
"Ah! how sad, he is indeed no disloyal subject;" and greatly
regretted that he had caused the bodies of his father and mother
to be disinterred and desecrated.
</p>
<p>Thus just as <persName>Sobu</persName> of <placeName>Han</placeName> fastened a letter to a goose's
wing and sent it to his native land, so did <persName>Yasuyori</persName> in <placeName>Japan</placeName>
send his verses home with the waves for bearers: one sending a
written message, the other a couple of stanzas, one in a remote
age and the other in these latter days. Though the one was far
away in a barbarian land and the other was but in <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>,
and the times were so different, yet the spirit of both was the
same. How truly worthy of admiration they were.

<head>THE LETTER OF RELEASE.</head>
<p>On the first day of the New Year of the period <placeName>Jisho</placeName> the
ceremony of New Year greeting took place in the Palace of the
<persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, and on the fourth day the Emperor himself
proceeded thither in state. These ceremonies did not depart in
any way from the usual precedent, but as in the summer of the
preceding year the <persName>Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> and other
of his retainers had been banished or executed, the <persName>Retired
Emperor</persName> still felt much resentment and could not give himself
to affairs of state with a quiet mind, and was in an unsettled
condition about things in general. <persName>Kiyomori Nyudo</persName> also, since the
revelations of <persName>Tada Kurando Yukitsuna</persName>, felt uneasy about the
<persName>Ho-o</persName>, and though outwardly appearing unaffected, beneath his
apparent calmness he took precautions and wore always a cynical
smile.
</p>
<p>On the seventh day a comet appeared in the eastern quarter
that is called in <placeName>China</placeName> '<foreign xml:lang="zho-Latn">Shiyuki</foreign>,' of evil omen; it is also called
'<foreign xml:lang="zho-Latn">Sekiki</foreign>'. On the eighteenth day its light increased. <persName>Kiyo-
mori's</persName> daughter <persName>Ken-rei-mon-in</persName>, who at this time bore the title
of <persName>Chugu</persName> or second consort of the Emperor, falling ill, there was
lamentation both at Court and throughout the country. In all
the temples the holy Sutras were recited and envoys were sent
to all the shrines, divination was performed and the physicians
concocted their medicines, using all the resources of their art
both exoteric and esoteric, but still the sickness did not pass
away.
</p>
<p>Then she was found to be pregnant.
The Emperor was now eighteen years old and the <persName>Chugu</persName>
twenty-two, and so far neither son nor daughter had been born
to His Majesty, so that if a son should how be born to the</p>
<pb n="111" xml:id="p135-111"/>

<p><persName>Chugu</persName> it would indeed be fortunate. The <persName>Heike</persName> rejoiced loudly
together, declaring that a son would surely be born, and other
noble families also, seeing how fortune now favoured the <orgName>Heike</orgName>,
did not doubt that so it would turn out. When she was decided
to be pregnant, the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, summoning all the priests of high rank
and saintly reputation, bade them use all their knowledge both
open and secret in bringing his star before the Buddhas and
<persName>Bodhisats</persName> and praying with all fervour that a son might be born.
</p>
<p>On the first day of the sixth month was held the ceremony
of assuming the belt of pregnancy, and <persName>Kaku-ho Shinno</persName> the
<persName>Lord Abbot of Ninnaji</persName> hastened to the Palace with the <title>Kujaku
Sutra</title> and performed the incantation ceremony of the <orgName>Shingon</orgName>
sect. The <persName>Tendai Zasshu Kakukai-ho Shinno</persName> and the <persName>Lord
Abbot of Miidera Enkei-ho Shinno</persName> also came up and recited the
prayers for obtaining a male heir.

poet <persName>Haku-raku-ten</persName>. (<persName>Po-chu-i</persName>).</note>
<p>Now as the months passed the <persName>Chugu</persName> suffered more and
more severely, just as was the case with the <persName>lady Ri</persName> in <placeName>Han</placeName>,
whose one smile contained a hundred charms; the illness of
<persName>Sho-yo-den</persName> too was of a like nature. <persName>Yo-ki-hi</persName> in <placeName>China</placeName> also
was said to have suffered more and more through the three
seasons, as the branch of blossoming pear held the spring rain,
as the lotus blossom withered, and as the dew fell heavy on the
'<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Ominaeshi</foreign>'. Considering the season of this illness it seemed
likely that some evil influences might be the cause, and on
enquiring by divination by means of a medium from <persName>Fudo
Myo-o</persName>, it was declared to be owing to evil spirits, especially
those of <persName>Sanuki-no-in</persName> <persName>Uji-no-Akusafu Yorinaga</persName>, the departed
spirit of the <persName>Shin Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName>, the evil spirit of
<persName>Saiko Hoshi</persName> and the living spirits of the exiles of <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>.
<pb n="112" xml:id="p136-112"/>

So in order to placate both the living and the departed spirits,
first of all <persName>Sanuki-no-in</persName> was given back his former title of <persName>Sutoku
Tenno</persName>, and <persName>Uji-no-Akusafu</persName> was raised posthumously in rank and
office, being made <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> of the upper first rank. <persName>Shonaiki
Korekata</persName> was appointed Imperial Envoy to proclaim these
things.
</p>
<p>Now the tomb of <persName>Uji-no-Akusafu</persName> was at <placeName>Gosan-mai</placeName> in
<placeName>Hannyano</placeName> in the village of <placeName>Kawakami</placeName> in the district of <placeName>Sou-no-
kami</placeName> in <placeName>Yamato</placeName>, and as in the autumn of <placeName>Hogen</placeName> it had been
dug up and the body thrown out on the roadside, since then the
grass had overgrown it more every year. How joyful must his
departed spirit have been when the Imperial Envoy arrived and
read his message. Then the deposed Crown Prince <persName>Sagara</persName> was
given the title of <persName>Sudo Tenno</persName> and thus <persName>Princess Igami</persName> was
restored to the rank of Empress. All this was done to appease
their angry spirits, for from ancient times angry spirits have
been considered very terrible. The madness of <persName>Rei-zei-in</persName> and
the deposition of the <persName>Retired Emperor Kwazan</persName> were said to be
owing to the angry spirit of <persName>Motokata-no-Mimbu-no-Kyo</persName>: there
was also the matter of the eye disease of the <persName>Retired Emperor
Sanjo</persName>; it was said to have been due to the spirit of <persName>Kwanzan</persName> the
Imperial Chaplain.
</p>
<p>Now when the <persName>Kadowaki Saisho</persName> heard of these things, he
sought <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName> at his residence and said: "I hear that
there is to be a very great pardon of offences beyond all
precedent in connexion with the prayers for the birth of a son to
the <persName>Chugu</persName>, and that such a virtuous and meritorious act as the
recall of the exiles of <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName> is contemplated." On
hearing this the <persName>Naidaijin</persName> at once went to his father and said:
"It is indeed pitiable how <persName>Kadowaki-no-Saisho</persName> laments for
<persName>Tamba-no-Shosho</persName>, and especially with regard to the sickness of
the <persName>Chugu</persName> it is said that it is due to the angry spirit of <persName>Narichika-no-Kyo</persName>, and if you intend to placate the departed spirit of the
<persName>Dainagon</persName> you will perhaps also recall the living <persName>Shosho</persName>: for if
you can thus allay peoples' anxiety, if it is thus according to
<pb n="113" xml:id="p137-113"/>

your will to accomodate the wishes of others, you will obtain
your own desire in that the delivery of the <persName>Chugu</persName> will be easy,
and she will bear a prince, and so will the glory of our line
increase greatly." The Lay-priest Chancellor, chancing to be
more soft-hearted thau usual replied: “Then what is to be done
with <persName>Shunkwan</persName> and <persName>Yasuyori Hoshi</persName>?" "Surely they too
should be recalled;" replied <persName>Shigemori</persName>, " for if one of them be
left behind it will be an evil deed." "That may be so with
<persName>Yasuyori</persName>, but as for <persName>Shunkwan</persName>, he is a fellow who rose through
my recommendation, and this is the man who, though he had
other places besides, held meetings at his villa at <placeName>Shishi-ga-tani</placeName>
on <placeName>Higashiyama</placeName> for his audacious designs against me. Him I
will certainly not pardon." So <persName>Shigemori</persName> returned and calling
his uncle the <persName>Saisho</persName> told him that the <persName>Shosho</persName> would be
pardoned, that he might set his mind at rest. The <persName>Saisho</persName>, without
waiting to hear more, clasped his hands together and wept with
joy. "Ah how pitiable it was when he went into exile to see
his wistful eyes full of tears whenever he looked at me,
wondering how it was I could not obtain his pardon." "Indeed so you
must have felt," replied <persName>Shigemori</persName>, " for a child is dear to
anyone. I will see further to the matter." And he went out.
Thus it was settled that the exiles of <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName> should be
brought back again, and the <persName>Nyudo</persName> issued the letter of pardon.
An envoy, was entrusted with this and immediately left <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>.
The <persName>Saisho</persName> in his joy sent a messenger of his own to accompany
the official envoy. Though they made haste both by night and
day, since the sea will yield to none, and they must brave the
waves and wind, though they left <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> during the last decade
of the seventh month, it was not until about the twentieth day of
the ninth month that they reached <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>.

<p>The envoy was <persName>Tanzaemon-no-jo Motoyasu</persName>. Quickly
disembarking from the ship he called with a loud voice on "<persName>Hei
<pb n="114" xml:id="p138-114"/>

Hangwan Yasuyori Nyudo</persName> and <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho</persName> exiled in this
place." Now the two were away as usual praying before their
<placeName>Kumano</placeName> Shrine; only <persName>Shunkwan</persName> was there, and he, hearing
them, at first thought it could only be a dream or that he was
being deceived by demons or evil spirits. Then wordering if it
might possibly be real, he hurried along so flurried that he fell
as he ran, and so presented himself before the envoy crying out
that he was the exiled <persName>Shunkwan</persName>. Then the envoy produced
from a bag that his servant carried the letter of pardon which
the <persName>Nyudo</persName> had sent, and <persName>Shunkwan</persName> opened and read thus:
"The crime for which exile was ordered is pardoned and the
persons herein mentioned may return to the capital. In
connexion with the prayers for the safe delivery of the <persName>Chugu</persName> a
special pardon has been granted: the exiles of <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>
<persName>Shosho Naritsune</persName> and <persName>Yasuyori Hoshi</persName> are pardoned." This
only was written and there was no word of <persName>Shunkwan</persName>. Think-
ing that perhaps it was written on the envelope, he looked, but
there was nothing there also. He read it from the beginning to
the end and from the end to the beginning, but two persons only
were mentioned, there was nothing said of three. Then the
<persName>Shosho</persName> and <persName>Yasuyori</persName> appeared, and, each reading it in turn,
verily it was only they two whose names stood written and there
was nothing of anyone besides. It all seemed indeed a dream,
and when they thought it a dream it was a reality, when they
thought of it as a reality it was even as a dream. Beside this
there were many letters for the two from <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, but for <persName>Shun-
kwan Sozu</persName> there was nothing at all. It seemed that all his
friends and connexions had disappeared from the capital. "Ah,"
`he cried, "the three of us were exiled for the same offence and
to the same place, how then is it that two only are granted a
pardon and I only am left out? Is it that I have been forgotten
by the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, or is it a mistake in the letter, or is there some
other reason?" He looked up to heaven and cast himself
down to the earth, weeping and lamenting, bụt all in vain.
Catching hold of the sleeve of the <persName>Shosho</persName>, he cried in tones of
<pb n="115" xml:id="p139-115"/>

agonised entreaty: "That I have fallen into such a plight is
because of the worthless plot of the late <persName>Dainagon</persName> your father,
you must not think it was anything else; if I am not pardoned I
cannot go to the capital, but at least take me in this ship and
bring me along with you as far as <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, for while you were
here with me, just as the swallows come in spring and the wild
geese of the ricefields in autumn, so I could get tidings
occasionally of my home, but now I am left alone from whom shall I
hear anything?" "Indeed that is so," replied the <persName>Shosho</persName>,"
and when we witness your anguish, all our joy at returning is
taken away and we feel as though we wish to stay with you, but
as to taking you with us in this ship, though we greatly wish to
do so, the envoy will not permit it at all, and if it were found out
that without permission three of us had left the island it would
be indeed a serious thing. But when I return to the capital I
will intercede with various people and entreat the favour of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> so that he may send someone to bring you back: be
patient and stay here awhile as before, and as your life has been
so far preserved, though you have been overlooked in this
pardon, at last you are certain to go free." But though they spoke
many consoling words, yet <persName>Shunkwan</persName> would not be comforted,
and when the ship made to put off again he tried to embark in it,
and falling off jumped up again with the madness of despair.
The <persName>Shosho</persName> left him his mattresses as a memento and <persName>Yasuyori</persName>
a part of the Holy Sutras. When they came to cast off the
hawser and put the ship off, the <persName>Sozu</persName>, seizing hold of it, was
dragged out up to his loins and then up to his armpits, following after
them as long as he could keep his foothold in the water and
entreating them : "Comrades, how can you thus abandon me
to my fate? Where is your former fellow feeling fled?
Since there is no pardon for me I cannot go to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, but at
least take me with you to <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>." But the envoy from
<placeName>Kyoto</placeName> would not give permission, and they pushed away his
hands as he clutched the vessel and at last rowed away, while
<persName>Shunkwan</persName>, giving himself up to despair, flung himself down
<pb n="116" xml:id="p140-116"/>

on the beach and stamped his feet on the sand like a little child
that has lost its nurse or mother. "Take me with you! Let
me go with you!" he shrieked and cried, but it was all of no
avail, and soon, as the ship rowed away, nothing was left but the
white waves. The ship was not yet so far distant, but his eyes
were blinded with tears so that he could not see it. Then,
running up to a high place, he kept on calling to mind the pathetic
story of how in former days <persName>Matsuura-no-Sayohime</persName> waved her
long sleeves, calling back the Chinese ship that bore away <persName>Otomo
Sadehiko</persName>.
</p>
<p>Thus the ship rowed away till it was seen no more, and
though the sun set <persName>Shunkwan</persName> did not return to his poor hut, but
spent the night lying where he was wetted by the spray and
dew. The <persName>Shosho</persName>, being a man full of pity, when he returned
did everything he could for him and indeed grieved that he had
not drowned himself on that shore. Thus we can understand
the grief of <persName>So-ri</persName> and <persName>Soku-ri</persName> of old when they were abandoned
on <placeName>Kaiganyama</placeName>.

<head>THE AUGUST LYING-IN.</head>
<p>Thus the two exiles left <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName> and came to <placeName>Kase</placeName> in
<placeName>Hizen</placeName>, And since the messenger whom the <persName>Saisho</persName> sent urged
them not to proceed to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> that year, as the weather was rough
and the passage dangerous, but to wait till spring, the <persName>Shosho</persName> spent
the rest of that year in <placeName>Kase</placeName>. Now from the hour of the Tiger (4
a.m.) on the twelfth day of the eleventh month of the same year
the <persName>Chugu</persName> began to be in travail, and <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and all the
<pb n="117" xml:id="p141-117"/>

capital were in an uproar. The place of lying-in was the <placeName>Ikedono</placeName>
mansion at <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> himself made an august visit
of ceremony: after him all the Courtiers from the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>
and <persName>Dajodaijin</persName> downwards, everyone who could be considered
anyone at all, and everyone without exception who held
emolument or office and hoped for place and promotion in future, came
and presented themselves at <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. When we refer to
former cases of the lying-in of Consorts and Empresses there
was always a great pardon. On the first day of the ninth month
of the second year of <placeName>Daiji</placeName>, when <persName>Tai-ken-mon-in</persName> was brought
to bed, a great pardon was proclaimed, and on this occasion
things were done according to that precedent and a very
extensive pardon was issued, so that among those guilty of serious
offences <persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName> was unhappily the only one who did
not share in it. A vow was made that there should be an
Imperial progress of the Empress and Crown Prince to the
shrines of <placeName>Hachiman</placeName>, <placeName>Hirano</placeName> and <placeName>Oharano</placeName> if the birth was easy
and a prince was born. This vow <persName>Sengen Hoin</persName> respectfully
heard: we speak of it with reverence. Prayer was also made at
twenty shrines of the <persName>Kami</persName> beginning with <persName>Ise Daimyojin</persName>, and
the Sutras were read at the temples of <placeName>Todaiji</placeName> and <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName>
beside sixteen others, those who read the Sutras being chosen
officials among those who served the shrines. Retainers wearing
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign> of ornamented brocade and girt with swords walked in
procession, carrying various sacred vessels and the Imperial
Sword and The Imperial Vesture, crossing over from the <placeName>Higa-
shi-no-dai</placeName> to the southern court and going forth from the middle
gate, A most auspicious and beautiful scene. <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>,
as was natural to his calm and unmoved nature, came long after
the others with his eldest son <persName>Gon-no-suke Shosho Koremori</persName>
<pb n="118" xml:id="p142-118"/>

and many nobles of lesser rank in a procession of cars bringing
presents; forty changes of garments of various kinds, seven silver
ornamented swords borne upon large trays, and twelve horses.
This was according to the precedent of the <persName>Kwampaku Fujiwara
Michinaga</persName>, who sent horses when his daughter <persName>Joto-mon-in</persName>,
Consort of <persName>Ichijo Tenno</persName>, was brought to bed in the era <placeName>Kwanko</placeName>.
<persName>Shigemori</persName> was the elder brother of the <persName>Chugu</persName> and since his
relation was especially paternal there was reason why he should
send these horses. <persName>Gojo-no-Dainagon Kunitsuna-no-Kyo</persName> also
sent two horses, and people wondered if this was because of his
great desire for a prince to be born or because of his great
virtue. Moreover horses were presented to seventy shrines
from <placeName>Ise</placeName> even to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName>, and very many sets of
decorations for the horses in the Imperial Stables. The <persName>Lord
Abbot of Ninnaji</persName>, <persName>Kakuho Shinno</persName>, read the <title>Kujaku Sutra</title>, while
the <persName>Tendai Zasshu Kakwaiho Shinno</persName> chanted the <title>Sutra of the
Seven Buddhas</title>. The <persName>Lord Abbot of Miidera</persName>, <persName>Enkei Shinno</persName>,
chanted the <title>Sutra of Kongo Doji</title>, beside which <persName>Godaikoguzo</persName>,
the <persName>Six Kwannon</persName>, the <title>Ichiji Kinrin Godan Sutra</title>, <title>Rokuji Karin</title>,
<title>Hachiji Monju</title>, and the <persName>Fugen</persName> of long life were all invoked and
recited from beginning to end. The smoke of incense filled the
whole Palace and the sound of bells echoed to heaven, while the
sonorous chanting of the Sutras made men's hair stand up.
Whatever evil spirits there might be, and in whatever direction
they might turn, they were put to flight. Then too a life-size

<p>Now though all these things were done and the pains came
continually upon the <persName>Chugu</persName>, yet she was not quickly delivered,
and the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and the <persName>Ni-i-no-dono</persName> his consort, pressing their
hands to their breasts in perplexity, continually ejaculated:
"What is to be done? What shall we do?" And ever when
anyone enquired something of them, all they replied was: "Do
as you please; Do as you like:" the <persName>Nyudo</persName> adding, "Ah, if I
were with my army in the field I should not feel anxiety like
this." All the while the diviners, the two <persName>Sojo</persName>, <persName>Hokaku</persName> and
<persName>Sho-un</persName>, <persName>Shunkei Hoin</persName>, and the two <persName>Sozu</persName>, <persName>Kozen</persName> and <persName>Jissen</persName>, were
chanting the Sutras and incessantly telling their rosaries and
praying, invoking the Three Treasures of their temples and all
their ancient and venerated statues and books and holy pictures.
Indeed it was a most blessed sight. And amid all this
sanctification, the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, who was just at this time engaged in
purification ceremonies preparatory to making a pilgrimage to <placeName>Kumano</placeName>,
sat in a chamber near the brocade curtain behind which the
<persName>Chugu</persName> was, and recited the Sutra of <persName>Kwannon</persName> of the Thousand
Hands.
</p>
<p>Now at this moment a change came. Though the holy
mediums who were wildly dancing went into a trance, for some
time they were silent. "Ah," quoth the "Ho-o whatever evil
spirit there may be, how can it come near when I am present?
Beside which all these hostile influences have been granted Our
Imperial Benevolence and restored to mankind, and even though
they are not grateful yet how can they now hinder us? Let
them quickly be put to flight!" (When women have difficult
labour and there is some obstacle hindering them, however
troublesome and difficult it may be, if a mighty spell be chanted
earnestly then the demon will depart and the birth become easy
<pb n="120" xml:id="p144-120"/>

and successful.) So they all applied themselves diligently to
their crystal rosaries with the result that not only was the Im-
perial Consort safely delivered but a Prince was born. Then
<persName>Hon-Sammi Chujo Shigehira-no-Kyo</persName>, who was then acting as
<persName>Chugu-no-Suke</persName>, came forth from behind the curtain and
announced in a loud voice: "The august labour is safely ended and a
Prince has deigned to be born."
</p>
<p>The <persName>Ho-o</persName> was the first to offer his congratulations; then the
<persName>Kwampaku Matsu Dono</persName> and the <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> and all the courtiers
below him and all the assistants and acolytes, the chief
astrologers, chief physicians, and all the diviners high and low, shouted
aloud their joy in concert so that the sound reverberated even
to without the gates and did not subside for some while. The
<persName>Nyudo</persName> too, in the excess of his joy, lifted up his voice and wept :
these were tears of joy indeed.
</p>
<p><persName>Komatsu Dono</persName> immediately hurried to the Palace of the
<persName>Chugu</persName> bringing ninety-nine <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">mon</foreign> in coin to place beside the
pillow of the baby Prince saying: "Heaven is father and Earth
is mother. May your life be as long as that of <persName>To-ho-saku</persName> and
<persName>Hoshi</persName>: may your mind be as that of <persName>Ten-sho-ko-daijin</persName>." And
taking a bow of mulberry and six arrows of '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">yomogi</foreign>,' he shot
them toward heaven and earth and the four quarters of the
world.

<head>The Visit of the Courtiers.</head>
<p>The wife of the former <persName>Udaisho Munemori</persName> had been chosen
as the milknurse for the child, but as she had died in labour on
the seventh month, the wife of <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName>

the title of <persName>Sotsu-no-suke</persName>. After a while the <persName>Ho-o</persName> made his
august return journey to his Palace, and when his car came to
the gate of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> to receive him, the <persName>Nyudo</persName> in an excess
of joy offered a thousand pieces of gold and two thousand <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">ryo</foreign>
in weight of Fuji cotton as a present. And this was surprising
to people and they said it was not fitting.
</p>
<p>There were many things too that people thought laughable
in the lying-in of the <persName>Chugu</persName>. For instance, the <persName>Ho-o</persName> acting as
a soothsayer; and in the second place, as it is the custom at the
lying-in of an Imperial Consort that a rice-vessel (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koshiki</foreign>) should
be rolled down from the ridge of the Palace roof, if a Prince is
born it is to be rolled down the south side, and if a Princess,
down the north side, this was done as usual; but by mistake it
was rolled down the north side, whereat there was a great uproar,
and it was brought up again and rolled down once more in the
proper manner. This was an ill-omened event in the opinion of
most people. What appeared ridiculous was the flurry and
agitation of the Lay Priest Chancellor, in contrast to the conduct
of <persName>Shigemori</persName>, which was much admired. Much to be regretted
was it that the former <persName>Udaisho Munemori-no-Kyo</persName>, having lost
his much-beloved wife, resigned both his offices of <persName>Dainagon</persName> and
<persName>Taisho</persName> and retired into seclusion: how happy had it been if both
elder and younger brothers had been there. Then came seven
astrologers to perform a thousand exorcisms and among them
<pb n="122" xml:id="p146-122"/>

was an old man named <persName>Kamon-no-kami Tokiharu</persName>. He was a
man of small property and office, and as so many people came
thronging there like the bamboo shoots that stand thick together,
yea even like rice sprouts, flax, bamboos and reeds, he cried out:
“I am an official. Make way!" and pressing through the midst
of the crowd, what a sight he presented! Having trodden off his
right shoe, he was resting for a moment when his headdress also
got knocked off, and at such a time to see a dignified old man
in ceremonial court costume, with his hair in disorder, pacing
along was more than the younger courtiers were able to endure,
and they burst forth into uncontrollable mirth. For the
astrologers say that their peculiar gait must be most punctiliously
observed. A strange thing too was that he knew nothing about
it all at the time, though afterwards when he came to think
about it he remembered everything. Now at the time of the
august lying-in the following notables visited <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. The
<persName>Kwampaku Matsu Dono</persName> (<persName>Fujiwara Motofusa</persName>), the <persName>Dajodaijin

the custom the <title>Tsurezure Gusa</title> says. "In the case of a birth, in the
Imperial Family the dropping of a ‘<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koshiki</foreign>' is not a fixed custom but is a
charm used when the afterbirth is obstructed. When it is not obstructed
it is not done. The custom came from the common people and has no
authority. The '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koshiki</foreign>' used are brought from the village of <placeName>Ohara</placeName>. In
pictures treasured from ancient times one sees the dropping of these
rice-vessels shown when a birth has taken place among the common
people." The charm originates in the assonance of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koshiki</foreign>, rice-box,
and <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koshi-ki</foreign> pain in the loins. The name of <placeName>Ohara</placeName> (also=great

<p>Now as the result of the great efficacy of their prayers,
rewards were given to the various temples. The eastern temple
of <placeName>Ninnaji</placeName> was repaired. Afterwards seven days' prayer was
ordered to be made, beside the reading of the Law of <persName>Daigen</persName>
and the ceremony of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kwancho</foreign> or baptism. <persName>Enryo Hogen</persName> was
raised to be <persName>Hoin</persName> while the Imperial <persName>Zasshu</persName> was given the

<persName>Kakusei Sozu</persName> was raised to the rank of <persName>Hoin</persName>, besides which
other rewards were bestowed too numerous to mention.
</p>
<p>After some time had elapsed the <persName>Chugu</persName> returned from
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> to the Palace. Since the daughter of the Lay priest
Chancellor had become Imperial Consort, monthly pilgrimages
had quickly been begun to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> the greatly venerated,
to pray that a prince might be born to her, and that he should
soon ascend the Throne in order that the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and his wife
might become Imperial Grandparents, and the <persName>Chugu</persName> had soon
become pregnant and been safely delivered of a Prince to their
great joy.
</p>
<p>Now the time that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family began to revere the
shrine of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName> was when <persName>Kiyomori</persName> only held the
office of <persName>Aki-no-kami</persName>, and with the income he derived from <placeName>Aki</placeName>
repaired the great pagoda at <placeName>Koya</placeName>. This work was finished in
six years, having been entrusted to the steward <persName>Watanabe-no-Endo Rokuro Yorikata</persName>, and when it was finished <persName>Kiyomori</persName>
himself proceeded to <placeName>Koya</placeName> and worshipped before the great
pagoda; after which he visited the <placeName>Oku-no-in</placeName>. Whereupon
<pb n="124" xml:id="p148-124"/>

from somewhere or other there 'suddenly appeared an old
priest with while hair and hoary eyebrows, his forehead furrowed
with many wrinkles, leaning on a cross-handled staff, who
addressed him thus: "From ancient days this holy mountain
has yielded place to none as a home of the <orgName>Shingon</orgName> doctrine;
and now our great pagoda has been repaired there is none like
it in the land. Now <placeName>Kebi</placeName> in <placeName>Echizen</placeName> and <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName>
are the two shrines where our doctrine of the Two Worlds is
revealed. <placeName>Keki</placeName> is very prosperous but <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> is in a very
dilapidated condition: do you therefore report this to the
Throne and repair it in like manner, and if this be done you
shall rise to high office so that there shall be none in the whole
country to equal you." Having spoken thus, he departed, and
where he had been standing a wondrous fragrance of incense
arose; and when <persName>Kiyomori</persName> went to look and see whither he
had gone he could see him but for a distance of three <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign>,
and then he disappeared. 'This was no mere man; it was the
<persName>Daishi</persName>: " he thought, reverently pondering over the vision, and
as a remembrance in this <placeName>Shaba-world</placeName> he painted two <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mandaras</foreign>
in the <placeName>Kondo</placeName> of <placeName>Koya</placeName>. The western <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Mandara</foreign> he had executed
by a painter named <persName>Jomyo Hoin</persName>, while the eastern one he
painted himself. And for what reason I know not he painted
the crown of <persName>Dai-Nichi Nyorai</persName>, the central figure, with blood
which he took from his own head.

and say: "I am the messenger of the <persName>Daimyojin</persName> of this
shrine; do thou take this blade and make secure therewith the
Throne of this Imperial Realm;" handing him a short halberd
ornamented with silver bands. On his awaking and reflecting
on the dream lo! it was a reality, for there was the halberd
beside his pillow. Moreover he received also this oracle from
the <persName>Daimyojin</persName>: "Whether you remember or forget, I know

<head>RAIGO.</head>
<p>When <persName>Shirakawa-in</persName> was on the throne, the daughter of the
<persName>Kwampaku Fujiwara Morozane</persName> of <placeName>Kyogoku</placeName> became Imperial
Consort, and being a clever lady, was much beloved by the
Emperor, so that His Majesty, wishing to have a son by her,
summoned a priest of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> named <persName>Raigo Ajari</persName>, who was
renowned for the efficacy of his supplications, and promised him
that if he could successfully intercede with the Buddhas to grant
him a son by this lady, he should be given whatever he might
wish. <persName>Raigo</persName> respectfully assented and, returning to <placeName>Miidera</placeName>,
applied himself to his prayers with all his might to such effect
that the <persName>Chugu</persName> soon became with child, and on the sixth day of
the twelfth month of the first year of <placeName>Shoho</placeName> was safely delivered
of a Prince. The Emperor, greatly overjoyed, again summoned
<persName>Raigo</persName> and asked him what reward he wished for, whereupon
<persName>Raigo</persName> replied that he wished that a ceremonial dais should be
built at <placeName>Miidera</placeName>. Now the Emperor, thinking that he would
<pb n="126" xml:id="p150-126"/>

probably ask to be made <persName>Sojo</persName> at one step, was greatly
astonished at this unexpected request, for this ceremonial
dais for the ordination of priests was only allowed at <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>.
"Now this Prince is born," replied the Emperor, "we hope that
he will succeed to the Throne and that the land will remain in
peace and quietness, but if your request be granted <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> will
be wroth, the Empire will be disturbed, war will break out
between your two temples and the <orgName>Tendai</orgName> sect may be destroyed."
So that his desire was not granted.
</p>
<p><persName>Raigo</persName>, greatly disappointed, returned to <placeName>Miidera</placeName> and
determined to die by starvation. The Emperor on hearing of this
was greatly amazed, and calling <persName>Oe Masafusa</persName>, who was then
<persName>Mimasaka-no-kami</persName>, said to him. "Since you have been a pupil
of <persName>Raigo</persName>, go and see what you can do about this affair." <persName>Oe</persName>
hastened to <placeName>Miidera</placeName> and found that <persName>Raigo Ajari</persName> had retired to
his cell to ponder over the Imperial decision. Following him
thither he discovered the <persName>Ajari</persName> sitting in a small smoke-blackened
oratory from which he shouted in a voice of thunder: "The
word of the Emperor is no joke: an Imperial speech is like
sweat, If I cannot obtain my request I will carry away the
Prince that my prayers have made and take him with me to the
<placeName>Meido</placeName>": and without another word he retired to his cell.

<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shakujo</foreign>. a staff ornamented with metal rings carried by priests.</note>
<p><persName>Mimasaka-no-kami</persName> returning reported his experience to the
Mikado, whereupon His Majesty was exceedingly grieved.
Eventually <persName>Raigo</persName> died by starvation as he had said, and
thereupon the little Prince fell sick and took to his bed, and although
many prayers were said for him it seemed of no avail. Always
a white haired priest holding a '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shakujo</foreign>' appeared to stand at
the little Prince's pillow, and this not only in peoples' dreams
but in the reality of broad daylight, and on the sixth day of the
eighth month of the first year of <placeName>Sho-ryaku</placeName> the Prince at last
expired at the age of four years. He was known as <persName>Atsubumi
<pb n="127" xml:id="p151-127"/>

Shinno</persName>. The Emperor's grief was extreme, but at that time,
hearing that there was a priest at <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, the chief priest of the
<placeName>Saito Hall</placeName> named <persName>Ryoshin Dai-Sojo</persName>, who was then only <persName>Sozu</persName>
of <placeName>Enyubo</placeName>, who was reputed to be very potent in prayer, he
summoned him to the Palace and asked him what he could do,
"The Imperial Wish," he answered, "can certainly be
accomplished by the power of our sect, for was not a Prince born to
the <persName>Mikado Rei-zei-in</persName> by the effective prayers of <persName>Jie Dai-Sojo</persName>,
when requested by the <persName>Udaijin Kujo Morosuke Ko</persName>? It is not
a difficult thing." So, returning to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> for a hundred days
he gave himself up to earnest prayer, and within this time the
<persName>Chugu</persName> conceived, and on the ninth day of the seventh month of
the third year of <placeName>Sho-ryaku</placeName> she was safely delivered of a Prince
who afterwards became the <persName>Mikado Horikawa Tenno</persName>. Sọ even
in ancient times evil spirits were terrible things.
</p>
<p>At the time of this most auspicious lying-in of <persName>Ken-rei-mon-
in</persName>, it was a pity that, in spite of the amnesty that was granted,
<persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName> alone should have been omitted. On the
eighth day of the twelfth month of the same year the Prince was
nominated heir to the Throne, the <persName>Naidaijin Shigemori</persName> being
appointed Instructor and <persName>Ike-no-Chunagon Yorimori</persName> appointed
<persName>Daiyu</persName>. This year having ended it became the third year

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>THE SHOSHO'S RETURN TO KYOTO.</head>
<p>In the last decade of the first month <persName>Tamba-no-Shosho Nari-
tsune</persName> and <persName>Hei Hangwan Yasuyori Nyudo</persName> left <placeName>Kase</placeName> in <placeName>Hizen</placeName> and
started for <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> with all speed, but as the cold was still severe
and the sea rough, crawling from harbour to harbour and from
one island to another, it was the tenth of the second month
before they reached <placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>. Thence they went to see
<placeName>Ariki-no-Bessho</placeName> where the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, the father of the <persName>Shosho</persName>,
had lived. Here they found various writings on the bamboo
<pb n="128" xml:id="p152-128"/>

pillars and on the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shoji</foreign> that the <persName>Dainagon</persName> had left. "Ah," he
said, "there is no better memento than a person's handwriting.
If he had not written this here how could we have seen where
he was?" And the two of them read and reread it again and
again with tears. "On the twentieth day of the seventh month
of the third year of <placeName>Angen</placeName>, became a priest; on the twenty sixth
day of the same month <persName>Nobutoshi</persName> came from <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>." was
written. Thus they learned that <persName>Gensaemon-no-jo Nobutoshi</persName>
had been to visit him. On the wall near by was inscribed: “If
we trust to the Three Holy Buddhas to receive us, surely we
shall be reborn in Paradise." Whereat, seeing that he had
hoped to be reborn in the Pure Land, they felt somewhat
comforted amid their limitless grief.
</p>
<note type="footnote">Three Buddhas. <persName>Amida</persName>. <persName>Kwannon</persName> and <persName>Seishi</persName>.</note>
<p>When they enquired for his tomb, alas, there was no mound
raised over it, only a place where the earth was a little higher
than usual. Adjusting his sleeves respectfully, the <persName>Shosho</persName> spoke
as to a living person, weeping as he addressed him. "The
tidings that you had passed away to the world beyond were
indeed brought to me in the island where I was living, but not
being free I could not hasten hither. Since I was exiled to the
island I was so melancholy that life was unbearable even for a
day but I sustained my frail life and existed for two years, and
am exceeding joyful to return thus far, and if I could have found
my honoured father alive how blessed it would have been. As
it is now, length of days has become but vanity. Thus far I
have made great haste hither, but from to-day there will be no
need for hurry." Thus he spoke weeping, and had his father
been living how much would he have found to say in reply; but
with those in the grave there dwells no regret: who is there
that can smile when under the moss? The wind in the pines
was the only answer. That night the two spent in vigil at the
grave, and when day broke they made a new tomb, fencing it
about with stakes and building in front a temporary hut where
they stayed seven nights, repeating the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign> and reading
<pb n="129" xml:id="p153-129"/>

the Sutras. Then erecting a great <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sotoba</foreign>, they inscribed thereon
these words: "The deceased, a pure spirit, delivered from the
wheel of birth and death, now surely entered into the great
enlightenment;" with the date of the year and month and
beneath it, "<persName>Naritsune</persName>, a filial son." Surely no wood-cutter or
lowly peasant, however ignorant, could help weeping at this
proof of a child being the supremest treasure on earth. As the
years roll on, nothing is more unforgettable than gratitude for a
kind bringing up, like a dream it is and like a vision; yea, and
difficult to end are the present tears of love. The countless
Buddhas of the Three Worlds and Ten Quarters must have
deigned to grieve, and the revered spirit of the departed,
how must it have rejoiced. Then, though wishing to stay
longer to say the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign>, yet knowing the anxiety of
those awaiting them in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, they took their leave of the late
<persName>Dainagon</persName>, promising to return again, and departed weeping.
Even from those beneath the shadow of the grass it is hard to
part. On the sixteenth day of the third month at dawn the
<persName>Shosho</persName> reached <placeName>Toba</placeName>, where was the country residence of the
late <persName>Dainagon</persName>, called the <placeName>Suhama</placeName> mansion. On coming to the
mansion they found it all ruinous, the fence without a roof and
the doors gone from the gate. In the garden there was no trace
of anyone, and the moss had grown thick over everything.
Walking round beside the pond, the spring breeze of <placeName>Aki-no-
yama</placeName> was rippling its surface with white waves, the purple duck
and the white sea-gull swimming hither and thither. When could
they cease weeping and longing for him who had made it all?
The mansion still stood, but the entrance was broken in and
the shutters and doors had disappeared. The <persName>Shosho</persName> could do
nothing but fondly linger over everything associated with his
father, referring to him in words such as these:
"Here
it was that the <persName>Dainagon</persName> did so and so; here is the gate by
<pb n="130" xml:id="p154-130"/>

which he used to enter; that is the tree that he himself planted."
It was the sixth day of the third month, and some flowers were
still remaining in bloom; the willow, the plum, the peach, and
the apricot, recognizing the season by their flowering twigs.
'Though their former master was gone, yet the flowers forgat
not the spring." The <persName>Shosho</persName>, standing beneath the blossoms
murmured to himself the ancient verses:
</p>
<note type="footnote">Three Worlds. Present. Past, and Future.</note>
<note type="footnote">Ten Quarters. N.S. E.W. NW, NF, SW, SE. and Upper and Lower
Quarters.</note>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Peach and apricot cannot record the seasons that vanish:</l>
<l>There is no smoke to be seen; who was it lived here of old?"</l>
</lg>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Ah, if the flowers could speak that grow in the home of
our childhood;</l>
<l>Would I not ask them to tell all they remembered of you?"</l>
</lg>
<p><persName>Yasuyori</persName> too, on hearing this was affected by melancholy
feelings and could not but moisten his black sleeves with tears.
They wished to stay there much longer and, loath to leave, they
remained until the evening: as it grew dark the moonbeams, as
is their wont in ruined houses, fell through the ancient eaves and
flooded the mouldering chambers with light. Even when the
dawn began to break on the mountains they did not hasten
homewards, but as he could not remain there for ever, the
<persName>Shosho</persName> sent for the palanquin, since it had not waited for them,
and reluctantly left the <placeName>Suhama</placeName> mansion in tears, going on
towards <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> rejoicing and sorrowing by turns. A palanquin
had also come to meet <persName>Yasuyori Nyudo</persName>, but being unwilling to
part from his companion yet, hc did not use it, but getting into
the back of the <persName>Shosho's</persName> vehicle, went with him as far as <placeName>Shichi-
jo Kawara</placeName>, where their ways divided, but still they did not wish
to part. Those who spend half a day together under the
cherryblossoms, friends who look at the moon together for an evening,
travellers who stand under the same tree out of a sudden shower
until it is over, all these feel regret at parting; how much more
those who have lived a life of misery in the same island, on the
same ship and in the same storms; since they have the same
<foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Karma</foreign> must not their relation in the former life have been most
deep?
</p>
<pb n="131" xml:id="p155-131"/>

<p>The <persName>Shosho's</persName> mother, who was living at <placeName>Ryozen</placeName>, had come
the day before to the house of the <persName>Saisho</persName> to await her son, and
when she but caught sight of him as he entered, in her emotion
at seeing him alive, she covered her face and lay prostrate. His
wife too, who had been in the flower of her beauty when he left,
had become so emaciated with anxiety about him that he hardly
thought her the same person, while the black hair of his nurse
<persName>Rokujo</persName> had become snow-white. His child, who was three
years old at the time of his exile, had now grown old enough to
bind his hair. Seeing another child of three beside him, the
<persName>Shosho</persName> enquired who it might be, but <persName>Rokujo</persName> could only falter :
"Ah, that one indeed...... "when she was overcome by tears.
Then the <persName>Shosho</persName> remembered with sorrow that his wife had
been about to give birth when he was exiled and that this must
be the child that she had brought up safely. The <persName>Shosho</persName> then
visited the <persName>Ho-o</persName> as he had formerly been accustomed to do, and
was promoted to the office of <persName>Saisho-no-Chujo</persName>. <persName>Yasuyori Nyu-
do</persName> retired to a country seat that he had at <placeName>Sorinji</placeName> on <placeName>Higashi-
yama</placeName> and there lived quietly. His sentiments he thus expressed:
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Thickly the moss has grown on the eaves of the roof of
my home-place;</l>
<l>Through the opened chinks filter the beams of the moon."</l>
</lg>
<p>And so, living a secluded life, he pondered on his former
unhappy days, and diverted himself by writing a work called
'<title>Hobutsu-shu</title>' or 'Treasury.'

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>THE VISIT OF ARIO TO THE ISLAND.</head>
<p>Thus two of the exiles of <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName> were recalled and
returned to the capital, and now only one was left, a pitiful
guardian of the isle. Now <persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName> had a servant called
<persName>Ario</persName> whom he had taken pity on and brought up from his
childhood. This <persName>Ario</persName>, hearing that the exiles of <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>
were returning to the capital, had gone as far as <placeName>Toba</placeName> to meet
<pb n="132" xml:id="p156-132"/>

his master, and not seeing him had enquired aid been told that,
as his crime was most heinous, he alone had been left behind on
the island. Grief-stricken at the news, he took to frequenting
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, and as he did not hear that a pardon was likely to
be granted, he went to the daughter of the <persName>Sozu</persName> where she was
living in retirement and said: "This time he has been left
behind and has not come back; now I must go anyhow to the
island and find out how he is faring: so I pray you write me a
letter that I may take it." The lady was overjoyed at this and
immediately wrote as he had suggested. He would have wished
to take leave of his parents openly, but fearing they would not
agree, he went off without telling anyone. As the <placeName>China</placeName> ships
used to sail on the fourth or fifth month, thinking that to set out
in the summer would be too late, he started from <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> at the end
of the third month, and, after suffering a hard sea passage, arrived
at last in <placeName>Satsuma</placeName> Bay. At the port whence he tried to cross over
to the island, however, he was suspected and trapped and
searched, but, nothing daunted, he secreted the letter he was carrying
in his top-knot and in the end managed to get a passage in a
merchant ship and reach the island. He had heard some slight
account of it in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, but it was nothing to what he actually
found. No ricefields, no gardens, no houses, no village. There
were some inhabitants, but he could not understand their speech,
and thus when he went to enquire of them: "Where is <persName>Shun-
kwan Sozu</persName>, the <persName>Shugyo</persName> of <placeName>Hosshoji</placeName>, who has been exiled to this
place?" whether they understood the words '<persName>Hosshoji</persName>' or
'<persName>Shugyo</persName>,' or not, they answered nothing, but only shook their
heads. There was however one who knew that there
had been three men on the island and that two of them had
gone back to the capital, leaving one behind who wandered
about hither and thither as though beside himself, but lately he
had not been seen. On hearing this <persName>Ario</persName> plunged deep into the
uncertain mountain paths, climbing the peaks and descending
into the valleys. Losing the track in the mists, he could not find
his way until the golden sunset found him still on the hills, and
<pb n="133" xml:id="p157-133"/>

there he lay down and slept, but never once did he see the figure
of his master. Then, not finding him on the mountains, he
searched along the shore, but there was none who answered his
cries but the sea-gulls, whose foot-prints he saw on the sands or
the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">chidori</foreign> that flocked on the beach. But one morning he saw
a figure creeping along by the rocks on the shore, searching
for drift-wood and thorns, emaciated as a dragon-fly, looking like
a priest whose hair had grown long and bristling up on his head.
Over his skinny wrinkled frame a few rags were hanging,
whether of silk or cotton could not be discerned. In one hand
he had some '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">arame</foreign>,' and in the other a fish that someone had
given him. He was trying to walk, but could scarcely get
along and staggered like one drunken. <persName>Ario</persName> had seen many
beggars in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, but never yet had he seen one like this. 'All
the <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Asuras</foreign> dwell by the ocean; the <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Asuras</foreign> and the Three Evil
Things dwell in the depths of the mountains and by the ocean;'
say the Buddhist Sutras, and he thought for an instant that he
had unwittingly entered the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gaki-do</foreign> (<placeName>Preta-world</placeName>). But as he
approached he wondered if even such a creature might perchance
know something of his master, and going up to him repeated the
question that he had put to the islanders the day before : "Can
you tell me where I can find <persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName> the <persName>Shugyo</persName> of
<placeName>Hosshoji</placeName>?" The servant did not recognise his master, but
how could <persName>Shunkwan</persName> forget <persName>Ario</persName>? And crying out:
"Here! here he is," the things that he was carrying fell
from his grasp and he sank down senseless on the sand.
</p>
<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Asura</foreign>. A kind of demon or titan, the fourth class of sentient beings.</note>

<note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Preta</foreign>. Hungry spirits with huge belly and mouth, but extremely
narrow throat.</note>
<p>And thus it was that <persName>Ario</persName> found his master. Then taking
his dying master on his knees <persName>Ario</persName> cried: "Alas! after having
braved the rough seas and come so far, it is of no avai!. Thus
to find my master in such distress!" As he thus lamented in
<pb n="134" xml:id="p158-134"/>

tears, the <persName>Sozu</persName>, coming to himself and sitting up, said: "In-
deed you are beyond praise thus to dare the dangers of the sea
and come so far a journey. Day and night I have never for a
moment ceased to think of home, and the faces of my dear ones
were ever before me both in dreams and in illusions. Since I
have become so ill and weak I cannot tell dream from reality.
Even now I wonder if your coming is not a dream. If it be
indeed a dream, what shall I do when I awaken?" "Indeed
it is real," replied <persName>Ario</persName>, "but when I see your condition, it
seems a miracle that you can have lived to see me."
</p>
<p>"Not
only so," answered the <persName>Sozu</persName>, "but last year, when they came
to fetch the <persName>Shosho</persName> and the <persName>Hangwan Nyudo</persName>, I scarcely
refrained from dying by my own hand. Foolishly I relied on the
consoling words of the faithless <persName>Shosho</persName> that he would send
someone hither when he arrived at <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, but though not
unwilling to live, in this island there is no food; so, while I had
the strength, I used to go up into the mountains and collect
the sulphur that is found there. This I would barter for food
with the merchants who come from time to time from <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>,
but growing gradually weaker, I became unable to do so, and
now when the weather is fine I can but manage to creep out to
the beach and beg a little fish from the fishermen, or, when the
tide is out, pick up some shell-fish or edible sea-weed. Thus
holding on to my dew-like existence by the moss of the sea, I
have managed to keep alive in wretchedness until now; and I
wonder what reason there is for me to continue longer in this
fleeting world? But let us go to my house, for there are many
things I wish to say."</p>

<p>Then <persName>Ario</persName>, thinking it strange that one
in such a state should possess a house, took him on his back
and went towards a place that the <persName>Sozu</persName> pointed out. It was in
the midst of a pine wood, a hut made with bamboos for pillars
and bundles of reeds for cross-beams, thickly covered inside and
out with pine-needless: too frail it seemed to keep off rain and
wind. How strange a place is this for one who of late was Bursar
of <placeName>Hosshoji</placeName>, and had eighty manors in his charge, who had in
<pb n="135" xml:id="p159-135"/>

his gate-houses four or five hundred servants and retainers at
his beck and call! Indeed there are various kinds of <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Karma</foreign>,
that which reacts in the present life, that which reacts in the
next life, and that which will continue for many lives. This
<persName>Sozu</persName> had all his life been occupied with nothing but the
business of great temples and the affairs of <persName>Buddha</persName>, but while thus
professing the Way of <persName>Buddha</persName>, having committed a shameless
crime, the result of this <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Karma</foreign> fell upon him thus quickly in
this world.
</p>
<milestone unit="mccullough" n="9"/>
<p>The <persName>Sozu</persName> had now perceived that <persName>Ario</persName> was no apparition
and enquired; “Last year when they came for the <persName>Shosho</persName> and
the <persName>Hangwan</persName> there were no tidings for me; have you also
no letters from anyone?" <persName>Ario</persName>, choked with sobs, pressed his
face to the ground and for some time could answer nothing.
Then raising himself again, restraining his tears he replied:
"After my lord went to <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> the <persName>Nyudo's</persName> officials
came and confiscated all our property, and after arresting all the
retainers they examined them with respect to the revolt and
then put them all to death. Our lady fled with her youngest
daughter and went into retirement on <placeName>Mount Kurama</placeName>. I
went sometimes to see them and found them ever in a sorrowful
state. The child, as she missed you so much, would always
embarrass me by asking : "Please take me to <placeName>Kikaigashima</placeName>.”
But in the second month, being taken with small-pox, she died.
Our lady mistress, unable to bear this added blow, then sank
into melancholy and took to her bed, and on the second day of
the third month she also departed this life. Only the elder
daughter is now living safely in retirement with her aunt at
<placeName>Nara</placeName>, and it is from her that I have brought this letter." The
<persName>Sozu</persName> opened and read it and therein was written all that <persName>Ario</persName>
had said, to which was added: "Ah! why is it that when
three were exiled two have returned and one only is left, and so
far you have not come back? Alas! high or low there is none so
useless as a woman; if I had been a man I would have come to
the island whither you you have gone. Pray come back again
<pb n="136" xml:id="p160-136"/>

soon with this youth. "Ah," said <persName>Shunkwan</persName>, "see, <persName>Ario</persName>, the
pathetic simplicity of this girl, writing that I should soon come
back with you. If I had been free to please myself should I
have stayed three years in such a place? She must now be
about twelve years old; how will such a simple child be able to
marry? Perchance she may be able to keep herself by serving
in some great household," and he burst into tears afresh. How
does this remind us of the saying: "Even a wise parent goes
astray in considering his own children."
</p>
<p>"Since I came to this island," he continued, "as there was
no calendar I have had no knowledge of the days and months;
only by the blossoming and falling of the flowers do I know
that three springs and autumns have passed, and the voice of
the cicada alone tells me that wheat harvest is over and summer
is come. The piling up of the snow tells me that it is winter ;
by the waxing and waning of the moon I perceive that thirty
days have gone by, and by counting on my fingers I know that
my little boy will be six this year. Has he too preceded me to
the other world? When I went out that fateful day to <placeName>Nishi
Hachijo</placeName>, he wanted me to take him with me, and to console him
I said I would soon be back. It seems indeed but yesterday.
When I think of all these things the future is nothing to me.
The relation of parent and child, husband and wife is not for
this world only; now it is only about my daughter that I am
anxious, and if she be alive she may continue to live, even though
it be in wretchedness. But as for me, if I continue to live thus
the sight of my misery must pain you greatly."
</p>
<p>So from this time he steadfastly refused all food and
earnestly gave himself up to invoking <persName>Amida</persName> and saying the
deathprayers, and on the twenty-third day from the coming of <persName>Ario</persName>
the <persName>Sozu</persName> expired in his hut at the age of thirty-seven. <persName>Ario</persName>,
clasping the lifeless body, looked up to heaven and cast himself
on the ground, weeping unrestrainedly: "Ah, how gladly
would I follow you to the other world, but for my young
mistress's sake who is left behind, and because there is no other to
<pb n="137" xml:id="p161-137"/>

pray for my master's happiness in the after life, I must continue
to live and pray that he may attain enlightenment. So without
changing his resting-place, breaking down the hut and heaping
up dry pine branches and reeds upon it, he lighted the pyre, and
the smoke ascended heavy with brine. Then, the cremation
being finished, he gathered up the whitened bones and, hanging
them round his neck, awaited the coming of a merchant ship
and returned to <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>. From thence returning home he
sought out the place where the <persName>Sozu's</persName> daughter was
dwelling and related everything in detail from beginning to end,
'Very much I had hoped to have brought you a letter,” he
said, "and your father thought much about it, but in that island
there was neither inkstone nor paper, so that it was not possible
to write one: we live not only in this world but throughout
many worlds to come, and in another world in the far future
we may hear his voice and see his face, so let us earnestly pray
that he may receive enlightenment." Thus he spake, but ere his
young mistress had heard him to the end she fell forward on
her face and wept bitterly. Though but twelve years old
she straightway became a nun and lived a holy life in the
<placeName>Hokkeji</placeName> at <placeName>Nara</placeName>, praying for the happiness of her parents in the
hereafter.
</p>
<p><persName>Ario</persName>, taking with him the bones of <persName>Shunkwan Sozu</persName>, went
up to <placeName>Mt. Koya</placeName> and deposited them before the inmost shrine
called <placeName>Oku-no-in</placeName> where <persName>Kobo Daishi</persName> sleeps. Then, becoming
a priest at <placeName>Renge-dani</placeName>, he made a pilgrimage seven times round
the whole country, saying prayers for his master in the next
world. Now all these miseries accumulated to bring a terrible
end on the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house.

<head>THE WHIRLWIND.</head>
<p>On the twelfth day of the fifth month at noon a mighty

houses were overturned; the wind started from <placeName>Naka-no-Mikado Kyogoku</placeName> and blew across to the south-west, tearing
the roofs off the gate-houses of the mansions and carrying
them away to a distance of from four or five to ten <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign>.
Rafters and beams and pillars flew about in the air, and the
wooden shingles from the roofs blew about everywhere like
leaves in the wind. The mighty roaring of it was such that
even the wind of <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Karma</foreign> that blows people to Hell could not be
greater. Not only were houses destroyed but many people lost
their lives, and cattle without number were killed. This was no
ordinary occurrence, so that divination was necessary and the
Official Soothsayers proceeded to make it. "Within a hundred
days, a minister in receipt of great emoluments must look to
himself, beside which there will be a crisis in the Empire, and
the Throne and the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName> will decline: wars will also
follow one on another:" So the Official Soothsayers and Court

<head>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT PHYSICIANS.</head>
<p>In the summer of the same year <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>, feeling
melancholy and distressed about these and other matters, made a
pilgrimage to <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, and spent the whole night before the
<placeName>Shojoden</placeName> of the main shrine, calmly making his offerings and
humbly praying thus: "My father the Lay-priest Chancellor,
acting in a worthless and immoral fashion, is likely to trouble
even the Imperial Throne. Seeing this, even the prosperity of
this generation seems endangered. I, being the eldest son,
continually tender him advice, but being a stupid fellow, he does
not adopt my recommendations, so that it will be difficult to
honour our ancestors and exalt the name of our family. At this
time I find myself very incompetent, and thus I, unworthy des-
<pb n="139" xml:id="p163-139"/>

cendant of my line, cannot act as a good minister and wise son
to guide the fortunes of my house. Better were it to give up
my name, and, forsaking all hopes in this life, to try to attain
enlightenment in the future. But an ignorant and ordinary
person like myself surely will go astray in making choice; so I
cannot do as I would. <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Namu Gongen Kongo Doji</foreign>, I beseech thee,
let the prosperity of our line continue, that we may still be
favoured with the gracious friendship of our Sovereign, and that the
evil mind of my father may be softened, and that the Empire may
be peaceful in our days. But if our house is to be prosperous in
this one generation only, and shame is to fall on our posterity,
then I pray thee cut short even now the life of <persName>Shigemori</persName> and
deliver him from the wheel of sorrow in the life to come. I look
to thy mystic aid in both these petitions." And as he prayed
earnestly thus, a light as of a lamp issued from the body of the
minister and then suddenly disappeared as though extinguished,
and though there were many who saw it, yet for fear none said
anything about it. When the minister returned to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> and
while he was crossing the <placeName>Iwata-gawa</placeName> his eldest son <persName>Gon-no-suke
Koremori</persName> and some other Courtiers, who were wearing a violet
coloured under-dress beneath their white hemp costumes, it being
the hottest time of summer, for some reason or other went into
the water and were sporting there, so that the violet showed
through their wet upper garments and it looked like a single
garment of mourning colour. <persName>Chikugo-no-kami</persName>, seeing this,
called out: "A dress that suggests mourning is very ill-omened;
I pray you haste and change it quickly." But <persName>Shigemori</persName>
replied: "There is no need to change it; it is a sign that
my petition is to be fulfilled." And from <placeName>Iwata-gawa</placeName> he sent
offerings to <placeName>Kumano</placeName> with a thankful heart. The others present,
thought it strange, but he did not deign to enlighten them at all.
(But these Courtiers, strange to say, soon had to put on the
<pb n="140" xml:id="p164-140"/>

colour in real earnest.) After <persName>Shigemori</persName> returned to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, a
few days passed and he became ill. Thinking that the <persName>Gongen</persName>
had soon accepted his petition, he applied no remedy, neither did
he pray for recovery. About that time a famous physician came
from the <placeName>Sung</placeName> Court of <placeName>China</placeName> and was staying in <placeName>Japan</placeName>. Now
the <persName>Nyudo</persName> was at this time stopping at his country mansion at
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, and sent <persName>Etchu Zenji Moritoshi</persName> as a messenger to
<persName>Shigemori</persName>, saying: "I hear that your ailment is severe : as a
very distinguished physician has lately come from the <placeName>Sung</placeName>
Court, it is a fortunate thing, so pray call him and try his skill."
On hearing this, the minister, having himself raised in bed,
alled <persName>Moritoshi</persName> into his presence and said: "With regard to
this offer of the physician, I am much obliged to you, but
as you doubtless know well, that even such a wise ruler as
<persName>Daigo Tenno</persName>, in the era of <placeName>Enki</placeName>, should have allowed a
foreign physiognomist to be introduced into the capital is to be
considered a wise Emperor's mistake and a shame to our country
ever after. Far greater disgrace then would it be to our land
that a common person like <persName>Shigemori</persName> should bring a foreign
physician into the capital. When <persName>Koso</persName> of <placeName>Kan</placeName>, in administering
his country, struck down <persName>Keifu</persName> of <placeName>Wai-nan</placeName> with the three foot
sword that he carried, and was struck and wounded by a stray
arrow, the <persName>Empress Dowager Ro</persName> called a skilful physician who
said: "To heal this wound fifty pounds of gold will be
required." Then <persName>Koso</persName> answered; "As I have been strong in
defending myself, I have fought many battles and received many
wounds; they have not disabled me for my time has not come.
Our lives are in the hands of Heaven, and even if one had such
a famous physician as <persName>Henjaku</persName>, it would be no use." But as he
did not wish to appear to grudge the money, he gave fifty pounds
of gold to the doctor but did not receive the treatment. This is
a precedent with which I am quite satisfied. I, <persName>Shigemori</persName>,
though of no account, rose to be numbered among those of the

<p>first three ranks, and further was advanced to be one of the three
great ministers. My destiny therefore is in the hands of Heaven;
why should I question Heaven's will and hanker after
physicians ? If my illness is destined to be fatal, of what use is a
physician? But if it is not so destined, without a physician's
help I shall recover. Without availing himself of the skill of
<persName>Kiba</persName>, <persName>Shaka Muni</persName> declared his entry into <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Nirvana</foreign> by the <placeName>Batsu-
dai</placeName> river. Since this was a disease that was destined to be fatal
it was to show that it could not be cured. Only <persName>Buddha</persName> can
heal completely, <persName>Kiba</persName> can but alleviate sickness. If a fatal
disease can be cured by physicians, why then did <persName>Shaka</persName> die?
It is quite clear that medicine is of no value for a fatal disease.
But my body is not the body of a <persName>Buddha</persName>, so that distinguished
doctors or even <persName>Kiba</persName> are not necessary. If we judge by the
Four Books, how can even the best of an hundred remedies save
this vile mortal body of ours? Is it not also written in the Five
Volumes: "Though one can cure ordinary diseases, how can
one cure that which is caused by the <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Karma</foreign> of a previous
existence?" Moreover if I should live as the result of this
physician's treatment, if would seem as though there were no skilful
doctor in <placeName>Japan</placeName>. If his treatment is unavailing, it is not
necessary for me to see him; and if one holding the position of one of
the first three ministers of <placeName>Japan</placeName> comes to ask an interview of a
wealthy foreign guest, it is both a disgrace to the country and
also a degradation of his morality. So that though I may lose
my life, yet I must not for a moment think of disgracing my
country." Having heard all these words, <persName>Moritoshi</persName> weeping
returned to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> and repeated everything to <persName>Kiyomori</persName>.
"From of old time" said the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, "I have never heard of a
<pb n="142" xml:id="p166-142"/>

minister who would consider the disgrace of his country, and
neither did I think there was one in these degenerate days.
<persName>Shigemori</persName> is too good a minister: I fear that he may probably
die." So he hastily returned to the capital.

smooth things over; so that the Empire remained peaceful until
this time. But now all classes of society were lamenting and
wondering what would happen in times to come. But the

thinking that now the control of everything would fall into his
hands. Parents love for their children is often a cause of sadness
to them, but it is doubly sad when they die before their parents.
He was the pillar of his house and the wisest man of his age;
the loss of his kindness and affection and the decline of his house
cannot be too much deplored. The Empire lost a good minister,
and his house had to lament the loss of his counsel in the field.
Moreover he was a man versed in letters, loyal to the Emperor,
talented and accomplished and a man of virtuous conversation.

<head>CHAPTER XI,</head>
<head>THE UNDECORATED SWORD.</head>
<p>The character of this minister being thus remarkable, may
it not be that he could forsee the future? For before his
death, on the seventh day of the fourth month, he had a
dream. He seemed to be walking a long distance on the
shore when he saw a large <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">torii</foreign> near him; wondering what <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">torii</foreign>
it was, someone said that it was that of <persName>Kasuga Daimyojin</persName>.
<pb n="143" xml:id="p167-143"/>

Then a crowd of people came thronging to the place and one
of them held up the head of a big priest on the point of a sword.
<persName>Shigemori</persName> asked whose head it was. "It is the head of the
<persName>Dajo Nyudo Dono</persName> of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>," was the reply, "for the
enormity of his sins the <persName>Daimyojin</persName> of this shrine has ordered it
to be taken." Then he awoke. "Ah," he thought, "our
house has subdued the enemies of the Emperor many times since
<placeName>Hogen</placeName> and <placeName>Heiji</placeName> and, being greatly rewarded, has come to
produce a <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> who is grandfather to the Emperor. In
our clan more than sixty men have received great advancement,
and in twenty years there is none in all the Empire who can
compare with us in rank and office, and now, through the
manifold evil deeds of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, the fall of our family draws nigh;'
and he wept bitterly. Just at this time there was a great
knocking at the door of his apartment. On enquiring who was there,
they told him that <persName>Seno-no-Taro Kaneyasu</persName>, having just had a
very extraordinary dream, in spite of the lateness of the hour,
begged leave to relate it to him, and also requested that
everyone should be sent from the apartment. When all had left him
alone, <persName>Shigemori</persName> gave him audience, and he related with full
detail exactly the same dream as the <persName>Daijin</persName> himself had just had.
Then, thought <persName>Shigemori</persName>, the god has revealed these things to
<persName>Kaneyasu</persName> also.
</p>
<p>The next morning, as his eldest son <persName>Gon-no-suke-no-Shosho
Koremori</persName> was preparing to go to the Palace of the Retired
Emperor, his father called him and said: "For a parent to
say such things is perhaps rather conceited, but you are a very
clever son. Ho, there! serve the <persName>Shosho</persName> with a cup of <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sake</foreign>!"
<persName>Chikuga-no-kami Sadayoshi</persName> poured out a cup and offered it to
the <persName>Shosho</persName>, but as he would not drink before his father, the
<persName>Daijin</persName> drank three cups and afterwards the <persName>Shosho</persName> drank thrice
also. Then <persName>Shigemori</persName> ordered what he intended for the <persName>Shosho</persName>
to be brought, and they brought a sword in a bag of red
brocade. The <persName>Shosho</persName>, thinking that it was the sword called
<pb n="144" xml:id="p168-144"/>

'<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kogarasu</foreign>,' the famous heirloom of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, looked greatly
delighted, but how did his face fall when he saw that it was only
the plain black sword worn at the funeral of a minister. Then
his father said, weeping, "This is no mistake of <persName>Sadayoshi</persName>; it is
the black sword without decoration to be worn at a minister's
funeral. The <persName>Nyudo</persName> thought I should wear it to
accompany him to the grave, but now, as I shall certainly die
before him, I present it to you." The <persName>Shosho</persName> made no answer,
but, retiring to his apartment in tears, he covered his face and
lay down and did not go out that day. It was after this that
<persName>Shigemori</persName> went to <placeName>Kumano</placeName> and soon after he returned was
taken ill and died. Truly indeed he must have known.

<head>OF LANTERNS.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Shigemori</persName> was a minister who had a strong desire to
destroy evil and encourage virtue, and therefore, deploring the
coming doom of his house, in imitation of the forty-eight vows
of <persName>Amida</persName>, he built forty-eight temples at the foot of <placeName>Higashi-
yama</placeName>, and hung up forty-eight lanterns, one in each of them.
On the fourteenth and fifteenth of every month they were lighted
and prayers were offered, so that they looked like the brilliant
effulgence of the polished mirrors that shine in the beauteous
palaces of the Paradise of the Pure Land. Moreover two
hundred and eighty-eight young and lovely maidens of noble
birth were selected, six for each temple, and these were ordained
as nuns, that on these two days of every month they might raise
their voices in earnest and unceasing supplication. In truth it
seemed as if the light of the <persName>Nyorai</persName> who comes to receive men
shone on the earth, as if the rays of the All-Saving <persName>Buddha</persName>
shone on the minister. On the fifteenth day there was a great
<pb n="145" xml:id="p169-145"/>

supplication, and the minister himself walked in the midst of the
procession. Turning to the west and joining his hands together
he prayed thus: "Hail <persName>Amida Nyorai</persName>, Thou who guidest and
leadest us to the Paradise of the West, save, we beseech thee,
all men of the Three Worlds and Six Ways." When the
people saw him thus going round and praying, their hearts were
greatly touched, and those who heard of it shed tears of
gratitude. Therefore <persName>Shigemori</persName> became known by the name of
‘<persName>Toro-daijin</persName> ' or 'Lantern Minister.' .

<p>Now <persName>Shigemori</persName> wished to do many virtuous actions in this
life and to have prayers said for his benefit in the world to come,
but in <placeName>Japan</placeName>, however great merit a man may achieve, it is
doubtful whether he will have a succession of descendants to
pray for him in the future. He thought therefore that he
would acquire merit in another country to ensure prayers being
said for him after death. So in the spring of <placeName>Angen</placeName> he
summoned a certain ship captain from <placeName>Kyushu</placeName> named <persName>Myoden</persName> and
received him in private audience, giving him the following
commands: “You are a man of proved honesty; here are three

<p>After the death of

hastening to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, went into retirement there.</p>
<p>At the hour of the Dog (8 p.m.) on the seventh day of the
eleventh month of the same year, the earth quaked very greatly
for a long time, and the chief diviner <persName>Abe-no-Yasuchika</persName> hurried
to the Palace and gave his verdict as follows: "According to
the books of divination this earthquake is a very serious portent.
Consulting the book called <title>Kongikyo</title>, one of the three books of
divination, we find that it is not a matter of years, months or
days; it points to a very near and urgent affair:" and he lifted
up his voice and wept. The Imperial Messenger too was greatly
perturbed, and when it was reported to the Emperor, His
Majesty was extremely alarmed. But many of the younger
nobles and courtiers burst out laughing when they heard of it,
saying: "What is this useless <persName>Yasuchika</persName> weeping about? Is
it likely that anything much is going to happen now?" This
<persName>Yasuchika</persName>, however, had received the traditions of five
generations, and was deeply learned in astronomy, and as he had
always explained the omens accurately up till now without
making any mistakes, he was considered a divinely inspired prophet.
On one occasion in a thunderstorm the sleeve of his ‘<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign>’
had been scorched by a flash of lightning, without any injury to

his person; in whatever age a sign that he was specially favoured
by Heaven.
</p>
<p>On the fourteenth day the Lay-priest Chancellor, for some
reason or other, saw fit to return to the capital with a long train
of several thousand horsemen, thereby throwing the city into a
tumult, though there was no special reason for it. Someone
started the rumour that <persName>Kiyomori</persName> had come up to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> with hostile
intentions against the Imperial Court. The <persName>Kwampaku Motofusa</persName>
also hurried to Court, perhaps in consequence of some secret
information. "It seems that the <persName>Nyudo</persName> has come up to the
capital this time to try and overthrow me, and I know not what
affliction I may not have to endure;" said the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> to his
Imperial Master. "Whatever may happen to you," replied the
Emperor, "I shall feel as though the same misfortune had
befallen me:" and the august tears coursed down his Dragon
Countenance; we speak it with awe. Though the government
of the country was transacted by the Emperor and the <persName>Kwam-
paku</persName>, yet none knew what would happen; the matter was as
the will of <persName>Tensho-daijin</persName> or <persName>Kasuga Daimyojin</persName>. On the fifteenth
day there was no doubt that <persName>Kiyomori</persName> intended hostilities
against the Court, and the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> in great
consternation sent <persName>Joken Hoin</persName>, son of the late <persName>Shinsei Dainagon</persName>, to <placeName>Roku-
hara</placeName> with this message: "This year the Imperial Family has
been troubled and people are unsettled; the people also are
restless and disquieted, all of which causes us much grief. You
who have charge of everything, and can entirely pacify the
country, do not do so, but come up and make a commotion in
the city and menace the Imperial Court; what is the meaning of
it?" <persName>Hoin</persName> proceeded to <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName>, but the <persName>Nyudo</persName> would
not receive him, and having waited there from morning till
evening, as he could not obtain an audience, thinking it was no use,
he transmitted the Imperial Message to <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan
Suesada</persName> and went to take his leave, when the <persName>Nyudo</persName> ordered
him to be called back, and on his returning, thus addressed him:
"Ya-a, priest <persName>Hoin</persName>. Is what I say untrue? The death of
<pb n="148" xml:id="p172-148"/>

<persName>Shigemori</persName> is a great blow to our house, and you may guess how
deep is my grief. During the disturbances that followed the era
of <placeName>Hogen</placeName>, when the peace of the Emperor was disturbed, I only
administered affairs, while <persName>Shigemori</persName> also humbly exerted
himself to the utmost and pacified the Imperial wrath. Moreover,
whether in emergencies or in ordinary matters of administration,
a more meritorious minister would have been difficult to find.
Then consider the history of former ages, how the <persName>Emperor
Taiso</persName> of <placeName>China</placeName>, when his minister <persName>Gicho</persName> died, was excessively
grieved and wrote this inscription on his tomb, so great was his
sorrow: "Inso of old dreamed that he had a virtuous minister,
but I, when I awake know that I have lost a wise one." In our
country also, if I mistake not, when <persName>Akiyori-no-Mimbu-no-Kyo</persName>
died, the late <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> was excessively grieved, and
postponing his visit to <placeName>Hachiman</placeName>, refrained from going out. All
the Emperors, in fact, when their ministers died, mourned for
them, but now, when <persName>Shigemori</persName> has not yet been dead fifty days,
the Emperor goes to the shrine of <placeName>Hachiman</placeName> and to other places,
not showing the least sign of regret. Even if you forget <persName>Shige-
mori's</persName> loyal conduct, why do you not sympathise with my
grief? How can you forget <persName>Shigemori's</persName> loyalty? If both
father and son thus lose the favour of the Emperor, both are put
to shame. This is one thing: then, though the Emperor
promised not to change his demeanour either to my sons or
grandsons, as soon as <persName>Shigemori</persName> is dead, he takes back the domain of
<placeName>Echizen</placeName> which he had held. For what misconduct was this
done? Then again, when the office of <persName>Chunagon</persName> was vacant
and the <persName>Nii Chusho Motomichi</persName> earnestly desired it, I
recommended him for it, but no notice was taken and the office was
given to the son of the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>. However unreasonable I
may be, why is it that he was thus favoured? It is much to be
regretted that the Emperor should thus pass over one so suitable
in rank and birth in so arbitrary a manner. Then again, when
the followers and retainers of the <persName>Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName> met together in <placeName>Shishigatani</placeName> to foment a rebellion, that was
<pb n="149" xml:id="p173-149"/>

not done on their own initiative; it was in accordance with the
wish of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, and though it is a strange thing to
say, though the Emperor ought not to forget the services of my
house for seven generations, yet he planned to take away the
little remaining life that is left to me in my old age of three score
years and ten. It would seem then to be difficult for my
descendants to continue to serve the Court in after generations.
Thus bereft of my son in my old age, I am like a withered tree
that has no branches. What then is the use of my wasting my
time in such a case? What will happen you yourself can guess."
As he spoke thus vehemently, alternating between anger and
tears, <persName>Hoin</persName> was moved both to pity and fear, and the cold sweat
stood out upon him. No one could have made any answer at
such a time. Beside which he remembered that one of his own
retainers had taken part in the conspiracy of <placeName>Shishigatani</placeName>, and was
apprehensive lest he might be arrested on that account, feeling
rather like one who strokes a dragon's beard or treads on a lion's
tail; yet though he felt so terrified he showed nothing in his
demeanour, but only replied: "Indeed your services have been
very great, and no doubt your anger is not without reason, but
surely both as regards rank and emoluments you have no cause
for dissatisfaction. Moreover your great merits are always
remembered by the Imperial House. But to say that the revolt
of the Courtiers was by the design of the Emperor, is it not but
a treasonable slander? But to believe the ear and to doubt the
eye is always the bad habit of the world at large. To believe
the words of people of no account, putting aside the Imperial
favour and opposing the Emperor is, whether secret or revealed,
a very terrible thing. Heaven is wide and immeasureable
in extent and not otherwise is the mind of the Emperor :
that the inferior should be disobedient to his superior, how
can such conduct befit a minister? Pray consider this
well. This is the purport of what I have to say." All those
who stood by, on hearing this reply, exclaimed: "How
bold thus calmly to answer the <persName>Nyudo</persName> when he is in such
<pb n="150" xml:id="p174-150"/>

a rage." And there was none who did not praise him
greatly.

<head>Banishment of the DAIJIN.</head>
<p><persName>Hoin</persName>, returning from <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, reported the speech of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> to the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, and His Majesty, thinking there was much
right on his side, said nothing further. On the sixteenth day
the <persName>Nyudo</persName> carried out his intentions by depriving the <persName>Kwam-
paku</persName> and forty-three other Courtiers of their offices. The
<persName>Kwampaku Motofusa</persName>, on hearing in addition that he was
transferred to the office of <persName>Dazai-no-Sotsu</persName> and was to depart to
<placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, remarking that in an evil world like this it did not matter
what happened, retired to his house at <placeName>Furukawa</placeName> near <placeName>Toba</placeName> and
became a monk, his age being thirty-five. "He was an unclouded
mirror of courtesy," said everyone, and regret at his loss was
extreme. As when one sentenced to exile becomes a monk, they
do not send him to the province decided on, though it had been
decided to send him to <placeName>Hyuga</placeName> at first, since he became a monk
he was sent to a place called <placeName>Yuazama</placeName> near <placeName>Kofu</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>.
(Former examples of the exile of ministers are the <persName>Sadaijin Soga-
no Akae</persName>, <persName>Udaijin Toyonari</persName>, the <persName>Sadaijin Uona</persName> and the <persName>Udaijin
Sugawara</persName>, I mention him with great respect for he is the present
<persName>Tenjin of Kitano</persName>, besides the <persName>Sadaijin Komei Ko</persName> and the <persName>Naidai-
jin Fujiwara-no-Ishu Ko</persName>. Six in all, but this was the first
example of the exile of a <persName>Sessho Kampaku</persName>.) The son of the <persName>Naka
Dono Nii Chujo Motomichi</persName>, son-in-law of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, then
became <persName>Daijin</persName> and <persName>Kwampaku</persName>. In the time of the late <persName>Enyu-in</persName>,
on the first of the eleventh month of <placeName>Tenroku</placeName>, <persName>Ichijo-no-Sessho
Kentoku Ko</persName> died, and his younger brother <persName>Horikawa Kwampaku
Chugi Ko</persName> was then <persName>Juni-i Chunagon</persName> and another younger brother
<persName>Ho-ko-in Dai Nyudo Kaneie Ko</persName> was <persName>Dainagon-no Udaisho</persName>: of</p>
<note type="footnote"><persName>Sugawara</persName>. <persName>Sugawara-no-Michizane</persName>, now deified as <persName>Temmangu</persName> or
<persName>Tenjin</persName>: his great temple is at <placeName>Kitano</placeName> in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>.</note>
<pb n="151" xml:id="p175-151"/>

<p>these two <persName>Chugi Ko</persName> had been passed over by his brother in rank
and office, but when he in turn stepped over his brother and
became <persName>Sho-ni-i Naidaijin</persName> and obtained a private intimation of
this from the Emperor, everyone said it was the most
extraordinary promotion they had heard of. But a much more
extraordinary case was it when one who was only <persName>Ni-i-no-Chujo</persName>
and not a Councillor of State, passing over the office of <persName>Daina-
gon</persName>, became <persName>Daijin</persName> and <persName>Sessho</persName> in one leap. <persName>Fugenji Dono</persName>
(<persName>Motomichi</persName>) was the first one who ever did so. The Councillors
(<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Shokei</foreign>), the Ministers (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Saisho</foreign>), the Chief Secretary and the
officials under them were all dumbfounded. The <persName>Dajo-daijin
Moronaga</persName> was deprived of office and exiled to the eastern
provinces. As the reflection of the guilt of his father the evil
<persName>Sadaijin of Hogen</persName>, he with three of his brothers went into exile.
His elder brother the <persName>Udaisho Kanenaga</persName>, the younger brother
<persName>Hidari-no-Chujo Takanaga</persName>, and <persName>Hancho Zenji</persName> did not live to
return to the capital but died at their place of banishment, but
<persName>Moronaga</persName>, after nine years spent in <placeName>Tosa</placeName>, was recalled in the
eighth month of the second year of <placeName>Chokwan</placeName>. restored to his
original rank, and the following year raised to <persName>Shoni-i</persName> (Upper
Second Rank). In the tenth month of the first year of <placeName>Nin-an</placeName> he
rose from being <persName>Chunagon</persName> to the office of <persName>Gon Dainagon</persName> : the
office of <persName>Dainagon</persName> not being vacant at this time, he was added as
supernumerary. It was the first time there had been six
<persName>Dainagons</persName> at the same time. Also promotion from former
<persName>Chunagon</persName> to <persName>Gon Dainagon</persName>, with the exception of <persName>Uji-no-Dai-
nagon Takakuni-no-Kyo</persName> who afterwards became <persName>Yamashina-no-
daijin Minori Ko</persName>, was never known before. He was skilled in
music and very accomplished in other arts, so his progress was
rapid until at last he became <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName>. Then as the result of
some fault in a previous existence he was again sent into exile.
In former times in <placeName>Hogen</placeName> he was sent to <placeName>Tosa</placeName> by the southern

sea, and now in <placeName>Jisho</placeName> he was again, it seemed, to go to <placeName>Owari</placeName>
beyond the eastern boundary. But being guiltless as before, and
as a man of taste, only wishing to gaze at the moon in his place
of banishment, the <persName>Daijin</persName> made light of it. Recollecting how of
old <persName>Haku-raku-ten</persName>, when guest of the Crown Prince of <placeName>China</placeName>,
used to wander about the bay of <placeName>Jinyo</placeName>, in like manner he
leisurely passed his days, gazing at the distant sea scenery of the bay
of <placeName>Narumi</placeName> and viewing the clear moon, whistling to the sea
breeze and chanting songs to the accompaniment of his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">biwa</foreign>.
Once he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of <persName>Atsuta Myojin</persName> in
that province, and in the evening performed a recitation on his
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">biwa</foreign> to please the deity. It was a place where there were none
but unlettered people living, and there were none with any
elegant taste; but the village people, young and old, girls, fishermen
and farmers, came out with bent head and intent ear to listen,
though they knew nothing of time or rhythm. So it is said that,
when <persName>Koba</persName> played the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">biwa</foreign>, the fish would dance in the water'
and when <persName>Kuko</persName> sang, the dust on the beams would skip about.
When a genius performs, then emotion is invoked spontaneously.
So the hair of his audience stood on end at the wonder of his
playing, and as it gradually grew later, while he sung a piece
called '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Fuko</foreign>' or 'Fragrance', the flowers poured forth their
scent, and when singing of the 'Flowing Water' the moon shed
its pure clear white light over the scene; until at last the god,
unable to contain his feelings any longer, caused the sanctuary to
tremble greatly. Whereat the <persName>Daijin</persName> shed tears of joy saying:
"If it had not been for the evil conduct of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, I should
not have seen such a blessed sign."
</p>
<note type="footnote"><persName>Dainagon</persName>. These were originally four in number, but afterwards the
office of <persName>Gon-Dainagon</persName> or Vice-Dainagon was created, and their number
was not limited; in the time of <persName>Takakura Tenno</persName> there were ten.</note>
<p><persName>Azetsu-no-Dainagon Sukekata-no-Kyo</persName> and his son <persName>Ukone-no-Shosho Sanuki-no-kami Minamoto-no-Suketoki</persName> were both
deprived of their office, as also were the three officials <persName>Gondaiyu
Uhyoe-no-kami Fujiwara Mitsuyoshi</persName>, Counsellor of the <persName>Empress
Dowager</persName>, <persName>Okura-no-Kyo Ukyo-no-Daiyu Iyo-no-kami Taka-
shima-no-Yasutsune</persName>, and <persName>Kurando-no-Sashoben Chugu-no-Gon-

<pb n="153" xml:id="p177-153"/>

his son <persName>Ukonye-no-Shosho</persName> and his grandson <persName>U-shosho Masakata</persName>
were moreover expelled the same day from the capital. There-
upon the <persName>Dainagon</persName> remarked: "The three worlds are wide,
but there in no room for my five foot length; though life is short
it is difficult to live for a single day. If you go out of the Nine-
fold Imperial Court by night, you have got to go beyond the
Eightfold Clouds." So, going by <placeName>Oeyama</placeName> and the way of <placeName>Ikuno</placeName>,
first he came to a place called <placeName>Murakumo</placeName> in <placeName>Tamba</placeName> where he
stayed some time, then at last going on from thence he is said to
have reached <placeName>Shinano</placeName>.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16" xml:id="v3_ch16">
<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>THE CASE OF YUKITAKA.</head>
<p>Now among the retainers of the former <persName>Kwanpaku Moto-
fusa</persName> was a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> named <persName>Ko-no-Taiyu Hangwan Tonari</persName>, who
was not favourable to the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. Hearing that he was to be
arrested by <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, he took his son <persName>Ko Saemon-no-jo Ienari</persName>
with him and fled to the south country. Ascending <placeName>Inariyama</placeName>
and dismounting from their horses, father and son took counsel
together saying: "We had hoped to flee to the east and find
refuge with the former <persName>Uhyoe-no-suke Yoritomo</persName>, but he has been
excommunicated and is himself in jeopardy, and there hardly
seems any other place in <placeName>Nippon</placeName> that is not a <persName>Heike</persName> fief. As
therefore we cannot escape, and it is a disgrace to let our ancestral
home fall into strange hands, let us go back again, and when the
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> retainers come, we will set fire to the house and cut
open our bellies and die in the flames." So they went back again
to their mansion at <placeName>Kawarasaka</placeName> and, just as they had expected,
<persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Suesada</persName> and <persName>Settsu-no-Hangwan Mori-
sumi</persName> came against them with three hundred horsemen, shouting
their warcry exultantly. Then <persName>Ko-no-Taiyu Hangwan</persName> came
forth on to the verandah and shouting in a loud voice: "See
that you tell this at <placeName>Rokurara</placeName>!" set fire to the house, and
cutting himself open with his son, both perished in the flaming pile.
<pb n="154" xml:id="p178-154"/>

Now the reason why all these misfortunes fell on so many
people was the rivalry for the office of <persName>Chunagon</persName> between the
former <persName>Kwampaku's</persName> son <persName>Sammi-no-Chujo Moroka</persName> and <persName>Ni-i-no
Chujo Motomichi</persName> who became <persName>Kwampaku</persName>. How ever much
the former <persName>Kwampaku</persName> suffered for it did not so much matter,
but how about the justice of the forty-three others? And the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> did not stop at these things only, so that people said an
evil spirit had entered into him and he had lost all self-control, so
that the city was troubled thereat. In spite of the title of <persName>Sutoku
Tenno</persName> being given to <persName>Sanuki-no-in</persName>, and <persName>Fujiwara-no-Yorinaga</persName>, the
evil <persName>Sadaijin</persName>, being promoted in rank and office, still there was
no tranquillity.
</p>
<p>Now there was a certain former <persName>Sashoben Yukitaka</persName>, the
eldest son of <persName>Nakayama-no-Chunagon Akitoki-no-Kyo</persName>, who had
been made <persName>Shoben</persName> in the time of the <persName>Retired Emperor Nijo</persName>,
and was a very energetic official, but for the last ten years or so
had been retired from his office and was living in such straitened
circumstances that he had not sufficient food or clothing. To
him the <persName>Nyudo</persName> sent a message to make haste and repair to
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, as he had some matter to discuss with him. <persName>Yuki-
taka</persName> on hearing this was greatly perturbed, thinking that, in
spite of his having held no office or appeared in society for some
ten years, someone had slandered him to <persName>Kiyomori</persName> with intent
to bring about his complete destruction. His wife and children,
alsó terror stricken, uttered loud lamentations; however, as
repeated messages came from <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, <persName>Yukitaka</persName>, seeing that
he must obey, borrowed a car from someone and set out.
Quite contrary to his supposition, the <persName>Nyudo</persName> immediately came
forth and received him cordially; "Your noble father" said he
“did me various services, and I will not be negligent toward
his son. I have felt very sorry for your long exclusion from
office, but in face of the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> decisions I had no power to
remedy it: but now I bid you resume your duties and will give
orders about your new office." On his return home his family
received him, weeping for joy, as one that has returned from the
<pb n="155" xml:id="p179-155"/>

dead. Afterwards, by the hand of <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Sue-
sada</persName>, estates and fiefs were granted him as emolument, and as a
convenience besides, he was presented with a hundred pieces of
silk, a hundred <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">ryo</foreign> of gold, and abundance of rice. As
accessories of his office he was also granted a liberal allowance of
servants, ox-carts and drivers. <persName>Yukitaka</persName> was so overcome with
joy that he hardly knew where he was going or what he was
doing, it was so like a dream. On the seventeenth day he was
made <persName>Kurando</persName> of the fifth rank and again resumed his former
office of <persName>Sashoben</persName>. He was then fifty-one years of age, but
appeared to have suddenly become young again. It was
however a transient prosperity.

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>THE EXILE OF THE HO-O.</head>
<p>On the twentieth day of the same month the forces of the
<persName>Heike</persName> surrounded the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, and all the
ladies-inwaiting and male and female servants, thinking that they would
burn the Palace and put all in it to death as <persName>Nobuyori</persName> had done
when he attacked the <placeName>Sanjo Palace</placeName> in <placeName>Heiji</placeName>, forgetting all but
their own safety, fled in wild panic without even waiting to garb
themselves. Then the former <persName>Udaisho</persName>, <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName>, gave
orders to bring the Imperial Car and to make all haste, whereat
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, much perturbed, exclaimed: "Am I to be banished
to some far country or distant island like <persName>Narichika</persName> or <persName>Shun-
kwan</persName> ? I am not aware of having done anything wrong except
perhaps that since the Emperor is so young I have occasionally
given advice on affairs of state; if however this is not desirable,
I will do so no more in future." <persName>Munemori</persName>, shedding tears of
sympathy, replied: "Far be it from me to do such a thing; it
is only my father's wish that while things are in this unsettled
state, Your Majesty should go and stay for a while at the <placeName>North
Palace at Toba</placeName>." "Then," replied the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, "please deign to
attend me thither." But <persName>Munemori</persName>, fearing his father's anger,
<pb n="156" xml:id="p180-156"/>

did not accompany His Majesty, his conduct in this respect
being greatly inferior to that of his late brother <persName>Shigemori</persName>, who
the year before in such a case had at his own risk prevented the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> suffering so great a dishonour and secured his safety until
now. But now there was none to reprove the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, and so
this affair had come to pass. There seemed little hope for the
future, and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> thinking of these things wept bitterly.
Then, entering his Car, unattended by any of his nobles or
Courtiers, with only a few guards of low rank and an attendant
priest named <persName>Kongyo</persName>, he set out. At the back of the Imperial
Car rode a nun, who had been the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> milk-nurse, called <persName>Ki-no-Ni-i</persName>. As the Car passed along <placeName>Shichijo</placeName> toward the west and
then along <placeName>Shujaku</placeName> toward the south, the bystanders exclaimed:
"Ah! the <persName>Ho-o</persName> is going into exile ; " and there were none among
the common people who did not moisten their sleeves with their
tears at the sight.
</p>
<p>Everyone said that the earthquake on the seventh day was
a portent of this, and that it was because the Earth Deity who
responds even to a thousand million depths had raged furiously.
When the <persName>Ho-o</persName> had come to the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName> there was not a
single retainer to wait on him; but <persName>Daizen-no-Taiyu Nobunari</persName>,
having somehow managed to escape notice, came and presented
himself before His Majesty. "I think it is likely that I shall be
put to death soon, sɔ I wish to have the Holy Water prepared.
How do you think?" asked the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. On hearing this <persName>Nobu-
nari</persName>, who had been extremely anxious all that morning, was
dumfounded, but girding up the sleeves of his '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign>,' and
pouring water into a cauldron, he broke down a small fence for
firewood, and splitting up some small beams of the corridor,
heated the water in due form.
</p>
<p>Then <persName>Joken Hoin</persName> went to the <persName>Nyudo</persName> at <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName> and
urged that, the <persName>Ho-o</persName> having gone to the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName> the night
before, it was too severe treatment that he should have not a
single person in attendance, so he himself wished to go and
attend on His Majesty. The <persName>Nyudo</persName> replied that as he was a
<pb n="157" xml:id="p181-157"/>

trustworthy priest he might go; whereupon <persName>Joken</persName> was
exceedingly delighted and immediately hastened to the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>.
Alighting from his car at the entrance, as soon as he entered
within the gate, he heard the voice of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> chanting the
Sutras, and it had indeed a very melancholy sound. When
<persName>Hoin</persName> hastily entered he saw the <persName>Ho-o</persName> sitting and shedding tears
upon the Sutra that he was reading, and in his grief at the sight,
he too pressed the sleeve of his white costume to his eyes and
thus came into his presence weeping. Only the nun was in
attendance. "Ah, <persName>Hoin</persName>," said the <persName>Ho-o</persName>," since you had
breakfast yesterday morning in the <placeName>Hojuji-den</placeName> neither last night nor
this morning have you taken any food. Neither have you slept
at all through the night: indeed I fear some danger to your
life." <persName>Hoin</persName>, controlling his feelings, replied: "Everything in
this world has an end; the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have held the Empire in their
hands for twenty years, but their evil deeds have gone on piling
up and verily their end too will come. And surely <persName>Tensho-
daijin</persName> and <persName>Sho-Hachimangu</persName> will not forget you, while there is
also the deity of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> on whom you rely, and who will
surely vouchsafe his sure protection. The oft-read eight books
of the <title>Hokke Sutra</title> will guard you, and then once more the
rule will return into your Imperial Power and all the offenders
will vanish away like foam on the water.” The <persName>Ho-o</persName>, on hear.
ing these words was somewhat comforted.
</p>
<p>The Emperor was much grieved at the exile of his <persName>Kwam-
paku</persName> and the loss of so many of his high officials, but when he
heard of the banishment of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>, he
would take no food, and becoming sick, he entered his august
sleeping apartment and would not come forth. The
ladies-inwaiting and the Imperial Consorts were at their wits' end to
know what to do. After the <persName>Ho-o</persName> had gone to the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>
special worship was held in the Imperial Palace; a dais of mor-
<pb n="158" xml:id="p182-158"/>

tar was made in the <placeName>Seiryoden</placeName> where the Emperor worshipped
<persName>Ise-no-Daijingu</persName> every night. These prayers were offered for the
<persName>Ho-o</persName>. The <persName>Retired Emper Nijo</persName> was a wise ruler, but since in
his opinion an Emperor has neither father nor mother, he was
always opposing the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and did not carry on the Imperial Line
successfully. Therefore his son the <persName>Retired Emperor Rokujo</persName>,
after having ascended the Throne, unfortunately died on the
fourteenth day of the seventh month of the third year of <placeName>Angen</placeName>
at the age of thirteen.

<note type="footnote">Dais of mortar. It was made under the eives on the east side of the

<head>THE SEINAN DETACHED PALACE.</head>
<p>In a hundred volumes we find the saying. "Filial piety is

the most important thing. A wise monarch governs the Empire
by filial piety." Therefore we see that <persName>Tokyo</persName> revered his old
and feeble mother and <persName>Gushun</persName> respected his obstinate father. It
is very blessed when the Imperial Will follows the example of
such wise and pious rulers. About this time the Emperor
secretly sent this message to the <persName>Ho-o</persName> at the <placeName>Tosa Palace</placeName>: "In
such an age even though one live in the Palace what can one do?
Perhaps it is best to retire into the mountains and become a
recluse as was done by <persName>Uda Tenno</persName> in the era of <placeName>Kwampei</placeName> and by
<persName>Kwazan Tenno</persName> in former times." To this the <persName>Ho-o</persName> replied:
"Do not think of such a thing. If you remain as you are, it is
one source of reliance for me, but if you depart from the Palace,
on what can I rely? At any rate wait and see what my fate will
be." The Emperor, on receiving this letter, pressed it to his
face and wept unrestrainedly.
</p>
<p>As the sages have said: "The Emperor is the ship; the
subjects are the water. The water may make the ship float well,
or again the water may overturn the ship. The subjects may
protect the Emperor, or again the subjects may overthrow the
<pb n="159" xml:id="p183-159"/>

Emperor." In <placeName>Hogen</placeName> and <placeName>Heiji</placeName> the Lay-priest Chancellor
protected the Emperor, but now in <placeName>Angen</placeName> and <placeName>Jisho</placeName> he sets him
at naught just as the classic says.

and <persName>Seirai</persName> and <persName>Shinhan</persName> only were left; but these two, thinking it
was no use remaining at Court in such an age, even if they became
<persName>Dainagon</persName>, retired from the world and became monks while still
young. <persName>Mimbu-no-Kyo Nyudo Shinhan</persName> having the hoar-frosts
of <placeName>Ohara</placeName> for company, and <persName>Saisho Nyudo Seirai</persName> living among
the mists of <placeName>Koya</placeName>, both had no thought for anything but
attaining enlightenment in the next existence. In ancient days in
<placeName>China</placeName> too there were man who hid themselves in the clouds of
<placeName>Shozan</placeName> and cleansed their hearts under the moon of <placeName>Eisen</placeName>, so
what wonder was it that these deeply learned and pure minded
men should forsake so troublesome a world?
</p>
<p>When the <persName>Saisho Nyudo</persName> among the recesses of <placeName>Mt. Koya</placeName>
heard that the Emperor also wished to retire from the world, he
exclaimed: "Ah, well it was that I have so soon become a
recluse; for though to hear of it while here in seclusion is evil
enough, how great a grief would it have been to have heard it
while in attendance on His Majesty. The revolts of <placeName>Hogen</placeName> and
<placeName>Heiji</placeName> were indeed evil, but now the age has become more
degenerate, and such extraordinary things as this have come to pass.
What will happen to the Empire in future no one can tell. Would
that I could ascend above the clouds or hide myself deep in the
</p>
<pb n="160" xml:id="p184-160"/>

<p>farthest mountains." Verily it could not be considered a world
in which anyone with any sense would live.
</p>
<p>On the twenty-first day the <persName>Tendai Zasshu Kakukwai Ho
Shinno</persName> realized his oft-expressed wish and retired, the former
<persName>Zasshu Mei-un Dai-Sojo</persName> being reinstated in his place. The Lay-
priest Chancellor, though he had thus recklessly overturned and
scattered everything, seeing that his daughter was the <persName>Chugu</persName> and
his son-in-law the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>, now felt quite easy in his mind
about everything, and went off to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> declaring that the
administration was entirely according to the wishes of the Em-
peror. Ou the twenty-third day the former <persName>Udaisho Munenori-no-Kyo</persName> hastened to the Palace and reported thus to the Emperor;
whereupon His Majesty said: “If I had received authority from
the <persName>Ho-o</persName> according to custom I might do something, but as things
are, do you take counsel with the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> and do as you like
about the administration : " and he paid no further attention to
the matter.
</p>
<p>Now the winter was half over and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was in the
<placeName>Seinan Detached Palace</placeName>. The wind of <placeName>Yazan</placeName> sounded shrilly,
and the moon shone bright on the frozen garden. The snow fell
and piled up on the courtyard, but no one's footsteps were seen
upon it. The ice thickened on the ponds, but no flocks of birds
resorted thither. The boom of the bell of the great temple
resounded in his ears like that of <placeName>Iaiji</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName>; the white snow on
the western hills reminded him of the scene of the peak of <placeName>Koro</placeName>.
In the cold frosty evening the clink of the fuller's mallet was
borne faintly to his pillow; while at dawn he was awakened by
the slow wheels creaking on the ice outside the gate. The
travellers passing along the highway, the sight of the galloping
warhorses, the pomp and movement of this fleeting world, how
vain it seems to one who understands. The guards before the
<pb n="161" xml:id="p185-161"/>

Palace gates who kept watch day and night, by what connexion
in a former existence was it that they were now brought into this
relation with him? What an awe-inspiring thought it was.
Thus on every side the <persName>Ho-o</persName> found things that gave him pain.
So during his exile here he could not help occupying his thoughts
with the memory of the various excursions and pilgrimages and
festivals he had enjoyed, and the recollection of them would
bring tears to his eyes. And so things went on and the fourth
year of <placeName>Jisho</placeName> began.

<head>IMPERIAL PROGRESS TO ITSUKUSHIMA.</head>
<p>At the beginning of the New Year of <placeName>Jisho</placeName>, since <persName>Kiyomori</persName>
would not give his permission and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> feared to gainsay
him, the usual visits of ceremony were not made at the <placeName>Toba
Palace</placeName> during the first three days, with the exception of <persName>Sakura-
machi Chunagon Shigenori-no-Kyo</persName>, son of the late <persName>Shonagon
Nyudo Shinsei</persName>, and his younger brother <persName>Sakyo-no-daiyu Naga-
nori</persName>, who were allowed to go.
</p>
<p>On the twentieth day were held the ceremonies of the first
investiture of the Crown Prince with the '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hakama</foreign>' and the
first serving of fish to him; it was a very auspicious occasion but
the <persName>Ho-o</persName> only heard about it by rumour in the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>.
On the twenty-first day of the second month the Emperor, spite
of his not having any particular illness, was removed from the
Throne and the Crown Prince suceeded him. This also showed
how the <persName>Nyudo</persName> did as he pleased in everything, and everyone
excitedly chorussed: "Now are the palmy days of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>."
The Imperial Gem and the Sacred Sword were taken to the
<placeName>Naijidokoro</placeName> and the Court Nobles all assembled at the camp of
the Imperial Guard, everything being done according to ancient
precedent, while the <persName>Sadaijin</persName> also went out to the camp. On
hearing of the resignation of the Emperor, all those who
understood the circumstances could not refrain from weeping. When
an Emperor in the Retired Palace meditates on having resigned
the Throne to the Heir of his own accord, the future seems dark
and wretched, but when as now his wishes are not consulted,
but he is forced to resign, his state of mind must be truly pitiable.
</p>
<p>The Sacred Treasures were handed over and taken to the
<pb n="163" xml:id="p187-163"/>

<placeName>Gosho Palace</placeName>, where the New Emperor was to reside. When
the call of the watchman who gave the fire-alarm was heard no
more in the <placeName>Kan-in Palace</placeName> of <persName>Takakura Tenno</persName>, and Palace
Guards no longer kept watch and ward, but all was silent and
still, melancholy fell upon the older Courtiers even amidst the
rejoicings at the Imperial Accession, and they were affected even
to tears. The New Emperor was but three years old this year,
and people whispered to each other: "Ah, he too will retire
sometime;" but as <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> was the
husband of the Imperial wetnurse, <persName>Sotsu-no-suke</persName>, who was there
who could depose this one?
</p>
<p>In foreign countries we find <persName>Sei-o</persName> of <placeName>Shu</placeName> aged three years,
and <persName>Haku-tei</persName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName> aged two. In our country <persName>Konoe-in</persName> was
three years old and <persName>Rokujo-in</persName> two, all of them in long clothes
and none able to adjust his own dress, but carried in the arms of
the <persName>Kwanpaku</persName> or nursed by their mother they went through the
Accession Ceremony. Afterwards <persName>Kosho</persName>, Emperor of <placeName>Kan</placeName>,
succeeded to the Throne at the age of a hundred days. These are
the precedents for ascending the Throne both in <placeName>China</placeName> and
<placeName>Japan</placeName>, but the learned men of the time grumbled together
saying: "Ah, how terrible! Say nothing about it; are these
precedents good ones, I wonder?" Since the Crown Prince
had come to the Throne the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and and his wife were now
grandfather and grandfather to the Emperor, and, having obtained
an Imperial Decree for the three ranks of Empress, Dowager
Empress and Grand Dowager Empress, he distributed rank and
emolument, received and directed the ministers in attendance,
had ladies-in waiting dressed in flower-embroidered robes, and in
fact deported himself exactly like a Retired Emperor. With the
exception of the <persName>O-Nyudo</persName> of <placeName>Hokoin</placeName>, <persName>Kaneie Ko</persName>, this was the
first time that one who had become a priest had received the
Decree of the Three Ranks.
</p>
<p>During the first decade of the first month, the Emperor
<persName>Takakura</persName> made a pilgrimage to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName>. As it is the custom
for an Emperor who has relinquished the Throne first of all to visit
<pb n="164" xml:id="p188-164"/>

<placeName>Hachiman</placeName>, <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and <placeName>Kasuga</placeName> before going elsewhere, people
thought it very strange that His Majesty should go to the far
distant shrine of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName>. Some say that the <persName>Retired Em-
peror Shirakawa</persName> went to <placeName>Kumano</placeName> and that <persName>Go-Shirakawa</persName> went
to <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName>, but I know not. The reason that the Emperor
went to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> was because he had an important petition
to make there, and moreover as it was the shrine most highly
venerated by the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, on the one hand he would comply with
their wishes, while on the other there was the example of the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> shut up in the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName> before his eyes, so that no
doubt he went to pray that the heart of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> might be
Softened.
</p>
<p>Now this thing caused <placeName>Hiezan</placeName> to be angry, for they argued
that if the Emperor did not first visit <placeName>Hachiman</placeName>, <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and
<placeName>Kasuga</placeName> on his abdication, he certainly ought to come to their
temples, and wondered why he should go to such a distant
shrine as <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName>. "Let us go down to the capital
with our sacred emblem and prevent it;" they clamoured. So
the Emperor postponed his visit for a while until <persName>Kiyomori</persName>
managed to pacify the indignation of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>. Then on the
seventeenth day His Majesty started out on his pilgrimage to
<placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> by visiting the <persName>Ni-i Dono</persName>, the wife of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, at
her residence at <placeName>Hachijo Omiya</placeName>. That night the festival of the
Deity of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> began. The <persName>Kwampaku Motomichi</persName>
presented a car of Chinese style with changes of horses to the
Emperor. On the next day, being the eighteenth, His Majesty
went to the mansion of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and in the evening,
summoning the former <persName>Udaisho Munenori-no-Kyo</persName>, said to him: "On
the occasion of my going to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> I wish to go to the <placeName>Toba
Palace</placeName> to visit the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, do you think I ought to inform the
<persName>Nyudo</persName> or not?" <persName>Munemori</persName> replying that he thought it did not
matter, the Emperor asked him to go that night to the <placeName>Toba
Palace</placeName> and inform the <persName>Ho-o</persName> of his intention, and <persName>Munemori</persName> forth
with hastened thither. The <persName>Ho-o</persName>, on hearing the news was highly
delighted, thinking it too good to be true. So on the next day,
<pb n="165" xml:id="p189-165"/>

the nineteenth, <persName>Omiya-no-Dainagon Takasue-no-Kyo</persName> arrived
while it was yet dark, and the Imperial Progress to <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName>
was at last begun from the <persName>Nyudo's</persName> residence at <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName>.
The third month was not yet half over, but the moon of the
dawning day shone half-obscured and beclouded in mist, and the
cry of the wild-geese flying back from <placeName>Echizen</placeName> and <placeName>Echigo</placeName>
sounded melancholy in their ears. While it was yet dark they
approached the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>, and the Emperor, descending from
his Car before the gate, entered to find only a deserted mansion
in the shade of the thick trees: a dismal scene indeed.
</p>
<p>The spring was almost over and the summer foliage was
appearing, the cherry-blossoms were fading on the boughs and
the song of the '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">uguisu</foreign>' was growing old. His Majesty thought
how he had visited the <persName>Ho-o</persName> at his Palace of <placeName>Hojujiden</placeName> on the
sixth day of the first month of last year, when the musicians had
greeted him with sweet refrains, while the nobles were all in
waiting, and with the serried ranks of Guards the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> own
Courtiers had opened the curtained gate, and the attendants of
the <orgName>Kamon</orgName> spread matting on the ground, the whole ceremony
going smoothly and without fault: to-day it all seemed like a
dream.
</p>
<p><persName>Sakuramachi Chunagon Shigemori-no-Kyo</persName> now advanced
and announced the Imperial visit. The <persName>Ho-o</persName> immediately came
forth into the vestibule of his sleeping apartment to await His
Majesty. The Emperor was twenty years old this year and his
countenance was bright like the moon of dawn. His figure also
was very beautiful. He was exceedingly like his mother, the late
<persName>Kenshun-mon-in</persName>, and the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, being reminded of his departed
Consort, could not refrain from tears. Then the two Retired
Emperors seated themselves close together and, so that their
conversation might be private, the old nun alone remained in the
Imperial Presence. So Their Majesties remained long in converse
until the sun rose high in the heavens, when the Emperor
<persName>Takakura</persName> took leave of his Imperial Father and embarked in his
ship at <placeName>Kusatsu</placeName> in <placeName>Toba</placeName>. The Emperor felt deeply grieved to
<pb n="166" xml:id="p190-166"/>

see the silent and lonely condition of the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Detached
Palace, and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> on his part felt very uneasy when he
thought of the Imperial Journey and the perilous voyage over
the waves.
</p>
<p>Indeed His Majesty's putting aside the claims of the
shrines of <placeName>Ise</placeName>, <placeName>Hachiman</placeName> and <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and making this pilgrimage
to far-off <placeName>Aki</placeName> was most praiseworthy; how can it be without
acceptance before the gods? Doubtless the August Petition will
be granted.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2" xml:id="v4_ch2">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>THE IMPERIAL RETURN JOURNEY.</head>
<p>On the twenty-eighth day of the same month the Emperor
arrived at <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> and was lodged in the mansion of the
<persName>Naiji</persName> most beloved by the Lay-priest Chancellor, spending the
days there while the Sutras were chanted and <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Bugaku</foreign> dances
were performed. At the consummation of the vow the
hierophant <persName>Kogen Sojo</persName>, ascending the high seat, beat on a gong and
cried out the words of introduction in a loud voice thus: "How
awe-inspiring is the will of our Lord, leaving the Nine Gated
Palace to brave the eightfold sea-road to this, distant shore!"
And both the Emperor and all his subjects shed tears of joy.
Then they went round worshipping at all the shrines in
succession, beginning with the great shrine of <persName>Amida</persName>, <persName>Fugen</persName> and
<persName>Miroku</persName> and the lesser one of <persName>Tamonten</persName>; going round the
mountain five <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign> from the great shrine they went to the water-fall
shrine of <persName>Nyo-i-rin Kwannon</persName>. Then <persName>Koken Sojo</persName> fastened to
the pillar of the <placeName>Haiden</placeName> the following verse:
</p>
<note type="footnote"><persName>Miroku</persName>. <foreign xml:lang="sa-Latn">Sk. Maitreya</foreign>, a <persName>Bodhisattva</persName>, the Messiah of Buddhism. cf.
p. 212.</note>

<lg type="poem">
<l>"As with the snow-white cord of the cascade that falleth
from heaven.</l>
<l>So does His Majesty here bind his appeal to the God."</l>
</lg>
<pb n="167" xml:id="p191-167"/>

<p>The shrine-official <persName>Saiki-no-Kagehiro</persName> was promoted to the Lower
Fifth Rank, and the <persName>Kokushi Fujiwara-no-Aritsuna</persName> to the Lower
Fourth, and at the same time permitted to attend the Court of
the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>. The <persName>Zasshu Sonei</persName> was made <persName>Hogen</persName>,
Thus it was hoped that by the favour of the god the anger o
the <persName>Nyudo</persName> would be calmed.
</p>
<p>On the twenty-ninth day the ship was again made ready
and His Majesty started on his homeward journey, but as the
wind and the waves rose somewhat, they rowed the ship back
again and stopped that day at a place called <placeName>Gi-no-ura</placeName> in <placeName>Itsuku-
shima</placeName>. Then the Emperor ordered someone to make a poem
expressing his regret at parting from the <persName>Daimyojin</persName>, the god of
the island, and <persName>Takafusa-no-Shosho</persName> composed the following:
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Full of regret at parting, again we return to this
haven;</l>
<l>Surely these white waves are as a blessing divine."</l>
</lg>
<p>About midnight the wind dropped and the sea became calm, so
they rowed away again. That day they reached the harbour
of <placeName>Shikina</placeName> in <placeName>Bingo</placeName>.
</p>
<p>Here there was a mansion built in the period <placeName>Oho</placeName> by the
<persName>Kokushi Fujiwara Tamenari</persName> to accommodate the <persName>Ho-o</persName> when he
had journeyed that way, and <persName>Kiyomori</persName> had had it repaired for
the Emperor's use, but His Majesty did not go there. This
being the first of the month of the Hare (the fourth month) it
was the day of the ceremony of Changing Clothes at the Court,
and remembering this they all spoke of the affairs of the Capital,
and as they were singing snatches of song they caught sight of a
deep purple wistaria abloom oǹ a pine branch on the cliff, and the
Emperor, noticing it, ordered someone to go and bring it to
him. Thereupon <persName>Omiya-no-Dainagon Takasue-no-Kyo</persName>, respect
fully receiving the command, bade <persName>Sashisho Nakahara-no-Yasu-
sada</persName>, who was rowing in a small boat in front of His Majesty,
break it off and bring it. When the Emperor looked at the
wistaria as it grew on the pine-branch, he was much affected by
<pb n="168" xml:id="p192-168"/>

emotion and asked for a poem to be composed on it, when
<persName>Takasue-no-Kyo</persName> made the following verse:
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Full ten centuries long may the life of our Lord be
extended;</l>
<l>Ev'n as the Fuji flower clings to the evergreen pine."</l>
</lg>
<p>On the second day they reached <placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>. On the fifth
day the weather became clear and the sea calm, so they put
forth again, the Imperial vessel going first and the accompanying
ships rowing after. Breasting the head seas that burst in
foam like clouds and smoke, the same day they reached
the port of <placeName>Yamada</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName>, and from thence His Majesty
entered his palanquin and proceeded to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>. The sixth
day was spent there in visiting various sights, and His Majesty
went and inspected the country seat of <persName>Ike-no-Chunagon Yori-
mori</persName> at <placeName>Arata</placeName>. On the next day the Emperor conferred
promotions in rank on <persName>Kiyomori's</persName> family, to wit, the <persName>Nyudo's</persName>
adopted son <persName>Tamba-no-kami Kiyokuni</persName> was given the Upper
Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and his grandson <persName>Echizen-no-Shosho</persName>
the Lower Fourth Rank, Upper Grade. The same day they
came to <placeName>Terai</placeName>. On the eighth day all the Courtiers and Nobles
came to <placeName>Toba</placeName> to meet the Emperor. On the return journey
His Majesty did not go to visit the <persName>Ho-o</persName> at the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>,
but proceeded straight to the <persName>Nyudo's</persName> mansion at <placeName>Nishi Hachijo</placeName>.
On the twenty-third day of the same month the Accession Cere-
mony of the New Emperor took place. It should have been
held in the <placeName>Daikyoku-den</placeName>, but as it had been destroyed by fire
a year ago it was not yet rebuilt. Therefore a Council of
Courtiers was held, and it was suggested that it might be held
in the <placeName>Dajokwan</placeName>, but <persName>Kujo Dono</persName> said that the <placeName>Dajokwan</placeName> was
only a place that might be called a record office in the case of
an ordinary person's house, and that it ought to be held in the
<placeName>Shishin-den</placeName>. It was held therefore in the <placeName>Shishin-den</placeName>. Formerly
on the eleventh month of the fourth year of <placeName>Koho</placeName>, the Accession
Ceremony of <persName>Reizei-in</persName> was held in the <placeName>Shishin-den</placeName> because the

Emperor caught cold and could not go the <placeName>Daikyoku-den</placeName>. As
in the case of <persName>Go Sanjo-in</persName> in <placeName>Enkyu</placeName>, people said that this Acces-
sion Ceremony ought to have been held in the <placeName>Dajokwan</placeName>, but
no one could do anything in the face of the opinion of <persName>Kujo
Dono</persName>. It was called the Accession of the Crown Prince, it is
true, but it was the <persName>Empress Ken-rei-mon-in</persName> who went from the
<placeName>Koki-den</placeName> to the <placeName>Ninju-den</placeName> and sat on the Throne. All the
<persName>Heike</persName> family were present; only the retainers of the late <persName>Komatsu
Dono</persName>, who were in retirement owing to the death of their lord
the year before, did not appear.

<head>GATHERING OF THE GENJI.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Kurando-no-Saemon-no-Gonnosuke Sadanaga</persName> wrote
his congratulations on the Accession Ceremony having been
completed without any untoward circumstance, on ten sheets of
paper, and sent it to <persName>Hachijo Ni-i Dono</persName>, the wife of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>,
who rejoiced greatly with her face wreathed in smiles. Still,
though it was a very brilliant and auspicious occasion, most
people were far from being pleased.
</p>
<p>Now the second son of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, <persName>Prince Mochihito</persName>, whose
mother was the daughter of <persName>Kaga Dainagon Suenari-no-Kyo</persName>, was
living at the <placeName>Takakura Palace</placeName> in <placeName>Sanjo</placeName> and so came to be known
as <persName>Prince Takakura</persName>. His '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Gempuku</foreign>' ceremony had been held
secretly when he was fifteen years old, on the fifteenth day of the
eleventh month of the first year of <placeName>Ei-man</placeName>, at the <placeName>Omiya Palace</placeName>
at <placeName>Konoe Kawara</placeName>. He was known for the elegance of his
calligraphy and his brilliant intellect, and might have been Crown
Prince and ascended the Throne, but owing to the enmity of the
late <persName>Ken-shun-mnn-in</persName> he had to live thus secluded. In
springtime he would divert himself by writing poems as he strolled
out under the cherry-trees, and in autumn by making exquisite
melodies on his flute at the moon-viewing banquets. While he
was thus spending his days, having then reached the age of
<pb n="170" xml:id="p194-170"/>

thirty, in the fourth year of <placeName>Jisho</placeName>, <persName>Gensammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName>,
who was then living at <placeName>Konoe Kawara</placeName>, came secretly to his
Palace one evening and spoke his mind to him boldly, thus:
"Does your Highness not think it a very miserable thing that
you, who are of direct descent in the forty-eighth age from
<persName>Tensho-Daijin</persName>, and the seventy-eighth generation from <persName>Jimmu
Tenno</persName>, and might become Crown Prince and ascend the throne,
should thus live till the age of thirty in obscurity in this Palace?
Quickly raise a revolt and overthrow the <orgName>Heike</orgName>! Will it not
be a most worthy and filial act to relieve the anxiety of the Re-
tired Emperor, repining at his perpetual confinement in the <placeName>Toba
Palace</placeName>, and to ascend the Throne yourself as Emperor? If your
Highness should deign to consider this plan, and issue a Royal
Order for its execution, all the many members of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
family who are living in the various provinces will gladly flock
to your side. In <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>," he continued, "are the son of <persName>Dewa-no-Zenji Mitsunobu</persName>, <persName>Iga-no-kami Mitsumoto</persName>, <persName>Dewa-no-Hangwan
Mitsunaga</persName>, <persName>Dewa-no-Kurando Mitsushige</persName>, and <persName>Dewa-no-Kwanja
Mitsuyoshi</persName>. In <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, <persName>Juro Yoshimori</persName>, youngest son of the
late <persName>Rokujo Hangwan Tameyoshi</persName> is in hiding. In <placeName>Settsu</placeName> there
is <persName>Tada-no-Kurando Yukitsuna</persName>, but as he betrayed his allegiance
after having taken part in the plot of the <persName>Shin Dainagon Nari-
chika-no-Kyo</persName>, he is not to be relied on, but his younger brother
<persName>Tada-no-Jiro Tomozane</persName>, together with <persName>Teshima-no-Kwanja Taka-
yori</persName>, and <persName>Ota-no-Taro Yorimoto</persName> will certainly come. In <placeName>Kawa-

<persName>Kiso-no Kanja Yoshinaka</persName>, second son of the late <persName>Tatewaki-no-Senjo Yoshikata</persName>. In <placeName>Izu</placeName>, the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-Suke Yoritomo</persName>,
in exile. In <placeName>Hitachi</placeName>, <persName>Shida-no-Saburo Senjo Yoshinori</persName>, <persName>Satake-no-Kwanja Masayoshi</persName>, and his sons <persName>Taro Tadayoshi</persName>, <persName>Saburo

<persName>Kuro Hangwan Yoshitsune</persName>, youngest son of the late <persName>Sama-no-Kami Yoshitomo</persName>. All these are descendants of the Sixth
Imperial Grandson, and the posterity of <persName>Tada-no-Shimpachi
Mitsunaka</persName>, The two warrior families of <orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName>, whose
only duty is to quell the enemies of the Throne, have till now
been equal in power, but at the present time they are wide
asunder as Heaven and Earth; indeed it is not too much to say
that their relations are those of servant and master. The
provinces are oppressed by the Governors and the fiefs are abused
by the commissioners; people are harried in all matters and there
is no peace.
</p>
<p>Consider carefully the state of things at present.
Outwardly all submit, but inwardly there are none who do not
dislike the <orgName>Heike</orgName> rule. If therefore Your Highness will agree
to issue an Order, the <orgName>Genji</orgName> from every province will pour in night
and day, and the destruction of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> will soon be completed.
In that case, though I myself am an old man, I have many young
sons and will bring them to fight against the <orgName>Heike</orgName>." The
Prince was greatly perplexed to know what to do, so that for
some time he did not consent. There was, however, a certain
<persName>Shonagon Korenaga</persName>, grandson of <persName>Ako Maru Dainagon Mune-
michi-no-Kyo</persName>, and son of <persName>Bingo-no-Zenji Suemichi</persName>, who was
famous for his skill in physiognomy, so that people called him
'<persName>Physiognomy Shonagon</persName>', and he came and visited the Prince
<pb n="172" xml:id="p196-172"/>

and told him that by his features he was predestined to ascend
the Throne, and that therefore he ought not to abandon the
attempt to attain his object. <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName> also kept on
urging him, and suggesting that the plan was an inspiration of <persName>Tensho
Daijin</persName> herself, so that at last he made up his mind to act
Calling <persName>Shingu-no-Juro Yoshimori</persName>, he appointed him <persName>Kurando</persName>,
and changing his name to <persName>Yukiie</persName>, sent him as bearer of his
Royal Order to the <placeName>Eastern Country</placeName>.
</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month he left <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>
and went first to <placeName>Omi</placeName>, and then to <placeName>Mino</placeName> and <placeName>Owari</placeName> to rouse
the <orgName>Genji</orgName> residing there. On the eighteenth day of the fifth
month, arriving at <placeName>Hokujo Hiru-ga-Kojima</placeName>, he communicated
his message to the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-Suke Dono</persName> who was in
exile there; after which he went to the island of <placeName>Shinda</placeName> to his
brother <persName>Shinda-no-Saburo Yoshimori</persName>, and then crossed over to
the highlands of <placeName>Kiso</placeName> to warn his nephew <persName>Kiso-no-Kwanja
Yoshinaka</persName>. Now <persName>Tanso</persName> the <persName>Betto</persName> of <placeName>Kumano</placeName> somehow or
other had got to know of the matter, and he was an official
under great obligations to the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. "So <persName>Shingu-no-Jiro
Yoshimori</persName> is out with a Royal Order from <persName>Prince Takakura</persName> to
raise a revolt," said he," then <placeName>Nachi</placeName> and <placeName>Shingu</placeName> are sure to take
the side of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>: how can I, who have received such great
benefits from the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, forsake them at such a time? I must
surely draw bow in their defence before hastening to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> to
give all information." Whereupon he marched against <placeName>Shingu</placeName>
with a thousand men fully armed. At <placeName>Shingu</placeName> were <persName>Torii-no-Hogen</persName>, <persName>Takabo-no-Hogen</persName>, and their <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> <persName>Ui</persName>, <persName>Suzuki</persName>,
<persName>Mizuya</persName> and <persName>Kamenoko</persName>, and at <placeName>Nachi</placeName> <persName>Shugyo Hogen</persName> and his
men, their whole force together numbering about fifteen hundred
men. Shouting their warcry, both <persName>Genji</persName> aud <persName>Heike</persName> drew their
bows and the battle began. For three days it raged furiously,
the arrows whizzing without cessation, and the humming-arrows
continuing their whirring, until at last <persName>Tanso</persName>, when most of his
own retainers had been killed and himself wounded, barely
escaped with his life and fled back lamenting to his shrine.

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>THE ORACLE OF THE WEASELS.</head>
<p>Now the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was apprehensive lest he should share the
fate of <persName>Narichika</persName> and <persName>Shunkwan</persName> and be banished to some distant
province or remote island, but this did not come to pass, and
the fourth year of <placeName>Jisho</placeName> found him still confined in the <placeName>Toba
Palace</placeName>. Thus it happened that on the twelfth day of the fifth
month of that year, at the hour of the Horse (12. noon.) many
weasels made a great noise by running about the Palace, and
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, wishing to consult a diviner about it, called <persName>Omi-no-
kami Nakakane</persName>, who was then entitled <persName>Tsuru-no-Kurando</persName>, and
ordered him to go to <persName>Abe-no-Yasuchika</persName> and ask him, after due
consideration of the portent, to send a pronouncement on it.
<persName>Nakakane</persName>, respectfully assenting, went to the residence of <persName>Yasu-
chika</persName>, but it happened that he was away at that time, and being
informed that he was at <placeName>Shirakawa</placeName>, he proceeded thither, and
gave him the mesage of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, whereupon <persName>Yasuchika</persName> after
a short time handed him the pronouncement he desired. <persName>Naka-
kane</persName> immediately hastened with it to the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>, but when
he came to enter the gate, the guards on duty there would not
admit him. As he knew the buildings very well however, he
climbed over the wall and then creeping under the floor of the
Palace, managed to insert <persName>Yasuchika's</persName> prognostication through a
loose board in the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> room. When the <persName>Ho-o</persName> opened and
read it, he found this oracle; "Within three days you will have
cause both for rejoicing and lamentation." "In this condition,"
quoth His Majesty, "I may indeed rejoice, but what further
misfortune can befall me, I wonder?"
</p>
<p>On the thirteenth day, owing to the continued petitions that
the former <persName>Udaisho Munemori-no-Kyo</persName> made on behalf of the
<persName>Ho-o</persName>, the <persName>Nyudo</persName> at last relented and ordered that His Majesty
should be brought back to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> from the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName> and
lodged in the Palace of <persName>Bifuku-mon-in</persName> at <placeName>Hachijo Karasu Maru</placeName>.
And this was the cause of rejoicing that <persName>Yasuchika</persName> predicted
<pb n="174" xml:id="p198-174"/>

within three days. Now just at this time <persName>Tanso</persName>, the <persName>Betto</persName> of
<placeName>Kumano</placeName>, sent a courier to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> with the report of the rebellion
of <persName>Prince Takakura</persName>, and <persName>Munemori</persName> was thrown into great
consternation thereat. The <persName>Nyudo</persName> was at his residence at <placeName>Fuku-
hara</placeName> and when the news was sent to him, he flew into a great
rage and ordered <persName>Prince Takakura</persName> to be immediately arrested
and banished to <placeName>Tosa</placeName>. The carrying out of this order was
entrusted to <persName>Nijo-no-Dainagon Sanefusa</persName>, with <persName>To-no-Ben Mitsu-
masa</persName> under him, the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> under them being <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Kanetsuna</persName> and <persName>Dewa-no-Hangwan Mitsunaga</persName> with
three hundred fully armed men, and these proceeded at once to
the <placeName>Takakura Palace</placeName>. This <persName>Gendaiyu Hangwan</persName> was the second
son of <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, and the fact that he was included
proved that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> did not yet know that his father was
implicated in the plot.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5" xml:id="v4_ch5">
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT OF NOBUTSURA.</head>
<p>Now on the fifteenth evening of the fifth month, as <persName>Prince
Takakura</persName> was gazing at the beauties of the moon in a cloudy
sky, with no thought of anything that might happen, a messenger
came post-haste from <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName> with a letter, which his
foster brother <persName>Rokujo-no-Suke-no-Daiyu Munenobu</persName> at once
brought to him. It ran thus: "The plot is already revealed,
and you are to be banished to <placeName>Tosa</placeName>: the officials of the <orgName>Kebiishi</orgName>
have orders to take you, so leave the Palace quickly and go to
<placeName>Miidera</placeName>. I myself am shortly coming to the <placeName>Capital</placeName>." The
Prince was dumb founded at this news, and at a loss how to act,
when one of his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> who was always in attendance on him,
<persName>Chohyoye-no-Jō Hasebe Nobutsura</persName> by name, spoke out saying:
"There is nothing difficult in that; it is easy to escape in woman's
attire." This counsel seemed good, so the Prince let his hair loose,
donned a female costume, and put on his head a wide straw hat
such as the townswomen wear, while <persName>Rokujo-no-Suke-no-Daiyu</persName>
<pb n="175" xml:id="p199-175"/>

<persName>Munenobu</persName> went with him to carry his umbrella, and a youth
named <persName>Tsuru Maru</persName> accompanied them, carrying some articles in
a bag on his head. Thus imitating the appearance of a young
retainer escorting his mistress, they slipped out of the Palace
toward the north. Coming to a rather wide ditch, the Prince
leaped across it so lightly that some passers-by remarked to one
another. "How strange to see a woman jump a ditch like
that." This made the fugitives quicken their pace and hurry on
quickly, fearing to attract more notice. They left <persName>Chohyoye-no-Jo Hasebe Nobutsura</persName> behind as warden of the Palace, and he
at once proceeded to hide the few women of the establishment
who remained, and to put away everything unseemly that there
might be, when he happened to notice his master's much prized
flute called '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Koeda</foreign>,' that the Prince had forgotten in his hurry
and left by his pillow in his own apartment, a treasure
that he would wish to recover even if he had to come
back for it. "Ah," exclaimed <persName>Nobutsura</persName>, "what a pity! It
is my master's favourite flute." And running after them, he
came up with them within five <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">cho</foreign>. The Prince, overjoyed at
having it again, exclaimed : "When I die, see that you put this
flute in my coffin." And then added: "Pray come along with
us now." But <persName>Nobutsura</persName> replied: "When the officials come
to the Palace they must not find it abandoned. Moreover
everyone knows that I am in the Palace, and if they did not find me
there to-night they would know that you had just now escaped,
and that must not be. A <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> must live up to his reputation
even in the smallest matters. So I will go back and deceive
the officials; then I will cut my way out through them and
rejoin my master." So he returned alone. That night be
girded on under a light blue '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign>' a body-armour or
'<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Haramaki</foreign>' of bright green colour that grew fainter towards
the bottom, and an '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Efu tachi</foreign>,' and then, opening the great gate
of the Palace that fronted on <placeName>Sanjo</placeName> and the smaller one that fronted
on <placeName>Takakura</placeName>, he awaited the <orgName>Heike</orgName> officers. As he expected,
about the hour of the Rat (12 p.m.). <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan</persName>
<pb n="176" xml:id="p200-176"/>

<persName>Kanetsuna</persName> and <persName>Dewa-no-Hangwan Mitsunaga</persName>, with about three
hundred men, came riding up to the gate. <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan</persName>,
knowing the circumstances, stayed outside the gate, but <persName>Dewa-no-Hangwan</persName> rode through the gate and stopped in the
courtyard, crying out with a loud voice: "The Prince's plot is
already known; by order of the <persName>Betto</persName> of the <orgName>Kebiishi</orgName> we have
now come to send him into exile to <placeName>Tosa</placeName>. I pray you come
forth!" Then <persName>Nobutsura</persName>, standing above on the floor of the
Palace, replied: "His Highness is not here: he has gone to
visit some shrine. What is all this? Pray give a fuller
explanation." "Why is he not here? "replied <persName>Dewa-no-Hangwan</persName>,
" and where has he gone? Here, men, enter and search the
Palace!" "Ho!" returned <persName>Nobutsuna</persName>, "what rudeness is
this of an insolent official? To enter the gate on horseback is
strange conduct indeed, but to order your men to search the
Palace as well—what do you call such behaviour? I am <persName>Cho-
hyoye-no-Jo Hasebe Nobutsura</persName>. Come on at your peril!"
Then a strong and brave man named <persName>Kanetake</persName>, unsheathing his
sword, glared at <persName>Nobutsuna</persName> and sprang up on to the floor of
the Palace, seeing which fourteen or fifteen of his companions
followed him. Then <persName>Nobutsura</persName>, stripping off his '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign>,'
drew his sword, which, though but a light <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Eifu-tachi</foreign>, was a
blade of fine make and temper, and flourished it. His opponent
carried a huge blade and a great halberd, but <persName>Nobutsura</persName> at
once cut him down with his slender weapon so that he fell
suddenly back into the courtyard as a leaf is blown down by a puff
of wind. It was the fifteenth evening of the fifth month, and
the moon shone out brightly in the rifts of the clouds. The
Palace buildings were quite unknown to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> soldiers,
whereas <persName>Nobutsura</persName> knew every inch of them, so he struck
them down at his pleasure, now springing out on to
the verandah to cleave one through, now driving another into
a recess to cut him down, punctuating his blows with the fierce
<pb n="177" xml:id="p201-177"/>

shouts of the swordsman. "How dare you treat thus the
bearers of an official order?" exclaimed one of the intruders.
"Who talks of official orders," returned <persName>Nobutsura</persName> springing
back and setting his bent sword under his foot to straighten it,
after which he again slew some fifteen or sixteen stout
men-atarms in the courtyard. But three inches had now been broken
off his sword, so throwing it away, he felt for his dirk to cut
open his belly. His dirk, however, had fallen from his belt in
the fight, so opening the front gate he made to flee from the
postern fronting on <placeName>Takakura</placeName>. One of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> warriors,
however, sprang forward to intercept him with a huge halberd.
<persName>Nobutsura</persName> attempted to jump over it, but missing his leap, the
halberd caught between his legs so that he fell to the ground,
when, bold as he was, he was overpowered by the weight
of numbers and secured alive. Then bursting in, they searched
the Palace, but finding that the Prince had escaped, they bound
<persName>Nobutsura</persName> and took him away to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. There <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName>, standing on the verandah, had him brought into the
courtyard beneath, and passed sentence: "Because you have
attacked the officials of the <orgName>Kebiishi</orgName>, and paid no heed to a
government order, aud moreover have killed and wounded
many of our men, you shall be tortured until you give full
information, and than taken away to the river-bed and beheaded.',
Then that bold and fearless warrior <persName>Nobutsura</persName> stood erect and
laughed in <persName>Munemori's</persName> face. "So far I have paid no heed,"
said he, "to people who came spying round the Palace every
night, thinking they were of no importance, but when at
midnight two or three hundred armed men appeared, and on my
enquiring what they wanted, replied that they had an official
order, I remembered that I had constantly heard that bands of
robbers and thieves and pirates of all kinds are accustomed to
say that they are the train of a Courtier or that they have an
official order, so I asked what official order it was, and attacked
them at once: and if I had been in full armour and had a good
heavy sword, not one of these precious officials should have
<pb n="178" xml:id="p202-178"/>

come back here alive. Moreover when the Prince my master
will return I do not know, and if I knew, a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> does not
reveal what he has once determined to conceal, whatever torture
he may be made to suffer." When he had finished speaking,
all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> men-at-arms who were ranged round him exclaimed,
"Ah! a stout fellow indeed. Truly he is a match for a
thousand." And as they were discussing him one said: 'This is
not the first famous combat he has fought: last year at a certain
place he pursued six robbers singlehanded, whom the Palace
guard could not arrest, and slew four of them at <placeName>Nijo Horikawa</placeName>,
taking the other two alive, and it was for this bold deed that he
was made <persName>Chohyoye-no-Jo</persName>. What a pity to put such a man to
death." As therefore they were loath to do him to death,
whatever the <persName>Nyudo</persName> might think, they spared his life and he was
banished to <placeName>Hino</placeName> in the land of <placeName>Hoki</placeName>. Afterwards, when the
<persName>Heike</persName> had been overthrown and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> had come to their
own, he went down to the <placeName>Eastern Country</placeName>, and on his relating
the whole affair to <persName>Kajiwara Heizo Kagetoki</persName>, <persName>Yoritomo</persName> praised
him highly and rewarded him with a fief in <placeName>Noto</placeName>.

<placeName>Konoe</placeName> on the east, crossed the river <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and proceeded to
enter <placeName>Nyoiyama</placeName>. Formerly the <persName>Tenno of Kiyomihara</persName>, when
attacked by <persName>Prince Otomo</persName>, went to <placeName>Yoshinoyama</placeName> in the guise
of a woman, and this Prince was now in just such a plight,
fleeing far away through the trackless and unknown hills the whole
night through; his feet, torn and bleeding through the
unaccustomed toil, stained the sand like the dark maple leaves, and it
must have seemed that the dew of the moist verdure was
overwhelmed by his tears. Thus they reached <placeName>Miidera</placeName> at morning
<pb n="179" xml:id="p203-179"/>

light, and when the priests heard His Highness had come to
seek refuge with them, to save, it might be, his fleeting life, they
were exceeding respectfully overjoyed, and appointing the <placeName>Ho-
rin-in</placeName> as his lodging, gave him food and clothing with due
ceremony.

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>KIOU.</head>
<p>On the next day, the sixteenth, when it was known that
<persName>Prince Takakura</persName> had plotted a rebellion and had fled to <placeName>Miidera</placeName>,
there was no small commotion in the <placeName>Capital</placeName>.
</p>
<p>Now perchance it may be wondered why this <persName>Gensammi
Nyudo</persName>, who had been living quietly for a long time past, should
suddenly start this revolt. The reason was the extraordinary
things done by <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName>. Therefore in this world
people should very carefully consider how they inconsiderately
say things that ought not to be said, or do things that ought not
to be done. For example; <persName>Izu-no kami Nakatsuna</persName>, the eldest
son of <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, had a famous horse called <persName>Konoshita</persName>
that was renowned in the Palace, and was the most peerless of
chestnut steeds, and of its speed and gentle disposition none was
ignorant. And <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName> sent a messenger saying that
he wished this horse to be sent to him, for he had a mind to
inspect it: to which <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName> answered that he had the horse
indeed, but as he had ridden it much lately it was weary and he
had sent it to the country to rest. This being the case, nothing
could be done, but afterwards many of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> retainers spoke
saying: "Oh, that horse was there the day before yesterday:"
or "I saw it yesterday:" or "it was being ridden in the
courtyard this morning." On hearing this, <persName>Munemori</persName> exclaimed;
"Oh, he grudges it. Indeed? What hateful conduct! Here!"
And he sent his retainers with letters to demand it five or six, or
seven or eight times in one hour. When <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>
heard this, he said to his son: "Even if it were a golden horse,
<pb n="180" xml:id="p204-180"/>

if anyone desire it so much, one must not grudge it him, so send
it without delay to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. Then <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>, seeing that
there was no other way, sent the horse to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> with this
stanza :
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"How can one bear to part with a creature so dearly
beloved?</l>
<l>If it attracted you so, could you not visit me here?"</l>
</lg>
<p><persName>Munemori</persName> did not answer this, but exclaimed : "Ah, it is
indeed a fine horse; but as he was so loath to part with it, brand
its master's name on it." So they made a branding-iron with
'<persName>Nakatsuna</persName>' on it and branded the horse therewith. Then,
when anyone came to visit him and asked to see the famous
horse, he would call out : "Ho there! Put the saddle on
<persName>Nakatsuna</persName>. Bring him out! Mount him! Whip him up !” and
so forth. When <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName> heard of this, he was very angry
and said: "His using his authority to take away a horse I
valued as my life is no small thing, but how can one remain
quiet when one is made a laughing-stock in addition?" <persName>Gen-
sammi Nyudo</persName> also exclaimed: "What is this that the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
think to treat everyone with contumely and to do such folly?
In that case we must risk everything and watch for a suitable
opportunity." He himself did not make the plot, but persuaded
<persName>Prince Takakura</persName> to carry it out. This was learned afterwards.
</p>
<p>In this connexion people discreetly quoted a story of
<persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>. Once when he had been to Court he went
to visit the Empress, when a snake of some eight feet in length
got inside the left leg of his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hakama</foreign>. <persName>Shigemori</persName>, thinking that
if he made any fuss the Court ladies would be terrified and the
Empress too would be perturbed, gripping its tail with his left
hand and its head with his right, put it into the sleeve of his
'<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">naoshi</foreign>' without making the least sign of confusion; then, turning
round, he called for an attendant of the sixth 1ank. Then <persName>Izu-no-kami Nakatsuna</persName> who was then only <persName>Eifu-no-Kurando</persName>, being
called by name, came forward and was ordered to take the snake.
</p>
<pb n="181" xml:id="p205-181"/>

<p>Taking it he passed though the <placeName>Yubaden</placeName> and went forth into a
small courtyard of the Palace, where he beckoned to one of the
younger attendants of the Imperial Storehouses to take it away;
but the man, shaking his head, ran away. Then <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>,
calling one of his own retainers, <persName>Kiou</persName> by name, gave it to him to
throw away. The next day he received a fine horse and trappings
from <persName>Shigemori</persName> with the message: "In recognition of your
exceeding courteous behaviour yesterday I offer you this excellent
horse; please make use of him when you hurry off to meet <persName>Keisei</persName>
after your official duties are over." <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>, on receiving
it, made reply as follows: "In answer to the gracious gift of
your excellency, I am delighted to accept it respectfully: allow
me to congratulate you on your feat of yesterday, which was
indeed just like the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Kenjo</foreign> dance." Inasmuch as the demeanour
of <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName> was so considerate and courteous, <persName>Munemori</persName>
appeared the more lacking, and moreover his coveting another's
favourite horse and seizing it thus brought great calamity on the
country.
</p>

curtain (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">sudare</foreign>) in his hand while he danced, and afterwards slipped it

<p>So, on the evening of the sixteenth day of the same month
<persName>Gensammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName>, with his eldest son <persName>Izu-no-kami
Nakatsuna</persName>, his second son <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Kanetsuna</persName>,
<persName>Rokujo-no-Kurando Nakaie</persName>, his son <persName>Kurando Taro Nakamitsu</persName>
and three hundred armed men, after firing their mansion,
proceeded to <placeName>Miidera</placeName>. Now there was a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> of about the same
age as <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName> named <persName>Watanabe-no-Gensan Kiou</persName>, a
<persName>Takiguchi</persName> or Palace Guard, who, happening to come late. was
left behind and summoned to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> in consequence. "Why
is it," they enquired, "that you have not followed your ancestral
lord <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, but have stayed behind here?" <persName>Kiou</persName>
respectfully made reply: "If it had been an ordinary affair I
<pb n="182" xml:id="p206-182"/>

would have been the first to ride forth and risk my life, but I do
not know how this affair will turn out and so I have hesitated to
go!"
</p>
<p>"You have some connexion with us too," said <persName>Munemori</persName>,
"so consider, in view of the past and future supremacy of our
house whether you will follow <persName>Yorimasa</persName>, the enemy of the
Throne, or take service with us." <persName>Kiou</persName>, bursting into tears,
replied: "Spite of my relation to my lord, how can one agree with
an enemy of the Throne? I will then take service with you."
"Do so then," replied <persName>Munemori</persName>," and your recompense shall
be no less than with <persName>Yorimasa</persName>." And he re-entered the
mansion. But that day from morning till night, <persName>Munemori</persName>, not
quite reassured, kept on asking where <persName>Kiou</persName> was, and was
always told that he was still in the mansion.
</p>
<p>When the evening came <persName>Munemori</persName> once again appeared
and <persName>Kiou</persName> respectfully addressed him thus: "Since <persName>Gensammi
Nyudo</persName> has gone to <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, I think he will certainly try to
attack us by night; he will have with him my clan, the <persName>Wata-
nabe</persName>, and also the priests of <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, and they are not enemies to
be despised, so I pray you let me go and find him and slay him.
If I had a good horse I could easily get in by stealth, as I know
them all." <persName>Munemori</persName>, thinking the plan a good one, straightway
presented him with a valuable grey horse called <persName>Nanryo</persName> and a
splendid saddle and trappings. Having received it, he
immediately went to his own mansion and cried loudly: "Ho! the
night comes on: I go to <placeName>Miidera</placeName> to die fighting before my
lord <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>." It was almost sunset when, having
hidden his wife and children and set fire to his mansion, he set
out for <placeName>Miidera</placeName>. His heart was heavy as he rode off, but he
made a gallant and glittering spectacle, clad in a brocaded <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">kariginu</foreign> profusely embroidered with chrysanthemums, and wearing
a general's armour of scarlet; its name was <persName>Kisenaga</persName>, and it had
been a treasured heirloom for many generations. On his head
was a helmet shining with silver stars, and a splendid sword
hung at his side. In his quiver were twenty four arrows barred
with black on their white feathers, not to speak of the special
<pb n="183" xml:id="p207-183"/>

arrow, feathered with a hawk's wing, always carried by the
Imperial Guard of the <persName>Takiguchi</persName>. His bow was a ‘<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">shigeto</foreign>’ of
black lacquer with red binding. He rode on <persName>Nanryo</persName>, while
one of his retainers followed with a remount and another bore
his shield under his arm.
</p>
<p>Now as soon as <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> saw the flames go up from his
mansion they were greatly excited. "Ha!" exclaimed <persName>Mune-
mori</persName>, "that fellow has deceived us. After him and shoot him
down before he gets farther!" But <persName>Kiou</persName> was a warrior surpassed
by few in strength and valour, and of great skill in archery; and
he shouted to the pursuing <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> to come on at their peril,
for with each of his twenty-four arrow he would account for one
of them, whereat there was none found to engage him and he
procceded on his way unharmed. Now at <placeName>Miidera</placeName> where the
<persName>Watanabe</persName> clan was assembled, they were discussing him and
saying to one other: "Verily it is greatly to be hoped that
<persName>Kiou</persName> will not forsake us :" when <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, who knew
the mind of <persName>Kiou</persName> very intimately, replied: "Certainly he will
not be taken alive or fail us, his feeling for me is exceeding deep.
See he will soon be with us." And even as he spoke <persName>Kiou</persName>
appeared. "Lo! it is even as I have said: " exclaimed <persName>Yori-
masa</persName>. Then <persName>Kiou</persName>, making his obeisance, handed over the horse
he was riding: "See," he said, “I have brought <persName>Izu-no-kami
Dono</persName> the famous <persName>Nanryo</persName> from <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> in the Place of <persName>Kono-
shita</persName> that he lost." <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>, greatly rejoicing, immediately
cut short its tail, and, branding it also, sent it back to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>.
At about midnight it came back and entering the stable began
to eat with the other horses. Then the grooms of the stable
exclaimed in astonishment: "See! <persName>Nanryo</persName> has come back again ;"
whereupon <persName>Munemori</persName>, hurrying out to see, perceived branded
on its back the words: “Formerly <persName>Nanryo</persName>, now called <persName>Mune-
mori Nyudo</persName>." "Ah," he exclaimed in wrath, "If only I had
cut off his head before he had time to fool me thus. When we
attack <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, see that this rascal <persName>Kiou</persName> is taken alive, and then
I will have his head sawn off." But though he continued to
<pb n="184" xml:id="p208-184"/>

dance with rage, <persName>Nanryo's</persName> tail grew no longer, neither did the
branded sentence grow less conspicuous.

<head>THE LETTER TO HIEIZAN.</head>
<p>Now at <placeName>Miidera</placeName> they rang the bell and blew the conch to
summon the priests to council. "Of late, when we consider the
tendency of the time, the decline of the Buddhist Law and the
languishing of the Monarchy are especially evident. If we do not
now chastise the <persName>Nyudo</persName> for his evil doings, when will another
opportunity occur? Is it not through the protection of <persName>Hachi-
man</persName> and the help of <persName>Shinra Daimyojin</persName> that <persName>Prince Takakura</persName> has
come hither? Shall it not be then that the Hosts of Heaven and
Earth will pour down their favour, and the power and might of the
Gods and Buddhas bend him to our will? <placeName>Heizan</placeName> is a place
where also the <orgName>Tendai-shu</orgName> is devoutly studied, while at <placeName>Nara</placeName>,
the <placeName>South Capital</placeName>, are many who are zealous in meditation and
holy attainments: if then we send an appeal to them, surely they
will join us in a league together." Thus they decided with one
accord and sent an appeal to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> and <placeName>Nara</placeName>. That to <placeName>Hiei-
zan</placeName> ran as follows:
</p>
<p>"Appeal of <orgName>Onjoji</orgName> to <orgName>Enryakuji</orgName> for co-operation to save us
from destruction. Since the <persName>Nyudo Jokai</persName> wishes to destroy
Buddhism and overthrow the monarchy at his will, to our great
grief the second son of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> fled secretly to our monastery
on the fifteenth day of this month to escape persecution. And
though we have been repeatedly bidden by a so-called Imperial
Order to yield him up, yet we cannot consent. So we are
threatened with the despatch of an official army against us.
Therefore the overthrow of our monastery is now imminent and
all our brethren are in great trouble. Now <orgName>Enryakuji</orgName> and <orgName>On-
joji</orgName>, though their buildings are separate, yet both revere the one
<pb n="185" xml:id="p209-185"/>

Law of <orgName>Tendaishu</orgName>, even as the two wings of a bird or as the
two wheels of a cart they are to each other. So that if one be
wanting, will not the other feel the loss? If therefore you will
unite your strength with us, and save us from destruction, our
former animosity will be forgotten and we shall again dwell in
good fellowship together. Given by us, the chief priests, at a
council held on the eighth day of the fifth month of the fourth

<head>CHAPTER IX,</head>
<head>THE LETTER TO THE SOUTH CAPITAL.</head>
<p>When the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> read the letter of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> they
were astonished and said: "How is this? A temple that is
tributary to us writes that we are as tho two wings of a bird or
the two wheels of a cart! This is strange indeed." And they
made no reply. Moreover the Lay-priest Chancellor asked
the <persName>Tendai Zasshu Mei-un Dai-Sojo</persName> to calm the priests of
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and he hastened to the monastery and suceeded in
keeping them quiet. Thus he also intimated to the Prince that his
fate was yet uncertain. Beside this, by the order of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName>, twenty thousand <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">koku</foreign> of <placeName>Omi</placeName> rice and three thousand
bolts of silk of extra length from the <placeName>North Country</placeName> were
given to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> for the right of passing over its highways.
This was distributed among the monks of the various peaks and
valleys, but as it was done hastily, there were some priests
who received too much, while others went empty-handed. Whose
doing it was I know not, but someone scrawled up this lampoon :
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"The Yamahoshi's gown is short,</l>
<l>He cannot cover what he ought;</l>
<l>The shame he feels his friends to bilk,</l>
<l>For Nyudo Jokai's scanty silk."</l>
</lg>
<p>While some one who had got none at all wrote.</p>

<l>"The shame on us may lightly sit,</l>
<l>For we have not received a bit.”</l>
</lg>
<pb n="186" xml:id="p210-186"/>

<p>The letter that <placeName>Miidera</placeName> sent to <placeName>Nara</placeName> ran as follows:
</p>
<p>"A petition from <orgName>Onjoji</orgName> to <orgName>Kofukuji</orgName> to beg assistance that
this monastery may not be destroyed. Know that the supreme
excellence of Buddhism is to uphold the Monarchy; and the
duration of the Throne therefore depends on the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName>.
Now the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, the former <persName>Dajo-Daijin</persName>, <persName>Taira-no-Ason Kiyo-
mori Ko</persName>, whose priestly name is <persName>Jokai</persName>, does his will with the
authority of the country and turns the government upside down,
so that there is everywhere resentment and lamentation. And
on the evening of the fifteenth day of this month the second son
of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> hurriedly fled to our monastery to escape
persecution, and though they have demanded repeatedly that we give
him up, our priests unanimously refuse to do so, Therefore this
Lay-priest is collecting an army to enter our monastery, wishing
to destroy at one time both Buddhism and the Monarchy. In
ancient times in <placeName>China</placeName>, when the <persName>Emperor Bu-so</persName> in the era of
<placeName>Eisho</placeName> attempted to destroy Buddhism by force of arms, the
monks of <placeName>Joryusen</placeName> joined battle and repulsed him; if they thus
upheld their rights against the monarch, how much more shall
we not chastise this great rebel, this transgressor of the first of
the Eight Disobediences. <placeName>Nara</placeName> was the place where in
unprecedented fashion the guiltless <persName>Kwampaku</persName> was banished. If we do
not act now, at what time shall we able to remove this reproach?
Thus we pray you to lend us aid lest Buddhism be destroyed, and
also that this evil revolt against the Monarchy may be put away.
If we are of one mind we shall attain our object. Given at a

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>THE REPLY FROM NARA.</head>
<p>The monks of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, when they read this letter, also held a
council and after a while made answer as follows:
<pb n="187" xml:id="p211-187"/>

"From <orgName>Kofukuji</orgName> to <orgName>Onjoji</orgName>, greeting. According to your
communication, the <persName>Nyudo Jokai</persName> wishes to overthrow your
temple and its Holy Law. Now though divided into two
branches, both our temples are derived from one Pure source,
the golden discourses of the Sutras of <orgName>Tendai-shu</orgName>. Thus, both
North and <placeName>Sonth Capitals</placeName> being equally disciples of the same
<persName>Buddha</persName>, our temples together can surely overthrow even a
mighty enemy of the Faith, be he even as malign as <persName>Devadatta</persName>
himself. Now <persName>Kiyomori</persName> is of the very dregs of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and
but the off-scourings of the warrior caste: His grandfather
<persName>Masamori</persName> was a retainer of a <persName>Kurando</persName> of the fifth rank and was
at the service of the provincial governors of any fief. Long
ago, when <persName>Okura-no-Kyo Tanefusa</persName> was governor of <placeName>Kaga</placeName>, he
was employed by the <orgName>Kebiishi</orgName>, and when <persName>Shuri-no-Daiyu Aki-
sue</persName> was lord of <placeName>Harima</placeName>, he held the office of Groom of the
Stables. When his son <persName>Tadamori</persName>, father of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, was
granted the privilege of attending Court, he was universally
regarded as an outsider of low birth, and though he thus became a
Courtier, people still despised him as an upstart. No Courtier
who valued his reputation would have cared to enter such a
family. However, in the twelfth month of the first year of <placeName>Heiji</placeName>,
since the Emperor, in gratitude for his services in one battle,
bestowed on him an unparalleled reward, his family have gone
on rising until <persName>Kiyomori</persName> has made himself Chancellor, at the
same time wielding all the military power of the country, his sons
becoming Ministers and Commanders of the Imperial Guard
and his daughters Imperial Consorts or Empresses, while his
relatives and even the children of his concubines have been made
Courtiers, and his grandson and nephews raised to high office.
In addition to this he has appropriated all the fiefs that he desired,
and appoints and dismisses governors at his pleasure, making them
no better than his slaves and vassals. If anyone provokes his
anger in the least, be he Prince or noble, he is immediately
<pb n="188" xml:id="p212-188"/>

arrested, and if anyone speaks anything against him, be he
Courtier of the highest rank, he is put in bonds at once; so that
in order to escape death or disgrace even the Sacred Emperor
is forced to flatter him, while those of the noblest lineage must
make low obeisance. Even if his family property held for many
generations is taken from him, none dare open his mouth for
fear of worse happening, and if even the privileged estates of a
Prince are confiscated, for fear of the tyrant's power he holds his
peace. Presumptuous in his overweening strength, in the
eleventh month of last year, in the winter, he dared to attack the
Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and send the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> into exile. Verily
such a heinous crime has never been heard of from ancient days.
At that time we certainly should have set out against this rebel,
but in accordance with the will of our Deity and as the result of
consideration we repressed our anger for a season. But now that,
again raising an army, he has compassed about the Palace of the
second Imperial son of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, the Divine aid of <persName>Hachiman</persName>
and <persName>Kasuga Daimyojin</persName>, overshadowing him with their bright
radiance, has protected him and guided him to the protection of
the <persName>Shinra Gongen</persName>, thus clearly demonstrating that the Monarchy
can never be overthrown. Therefore what men of discrimination
are there who will not rejoice to hear that you are risking your
lives to protect him? We, on our part, though dwelling so far
away, feeling great pity at the news you secretly convey that
<persName>Kiyomori</persName> is raising forces to attack you, assure you of our
readiness to come to your assistance. On the eighteenth day at the
hour of the Dragon, after we had roused our monks and
informed all the other temples, and called on the tributary temples
to send their men, just as we had assembled our forces, you sent
by a swift messenger an invitation to join you and in one
hour 'dispelled the doubts of many days. If the monks of
the monastery of <placeName>Shoryo</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName> could drive off the soldiers of
<persName>Bu-so</persName>, how much more can the monks of the <placeName>North</placeName> and <placeName>South
Capitals</placeName> of <placeName>Yamato</placeName> do away with the villainies of this Minister?
Do you therefore guard well the residence of the Prince and we
<pb n="189" xml:id="p213-189"/>

will await your sign to advance. Consider our letter and do not
doubt us. Given on the twenty-first day of the fifth month of
the fourth year of <placeName>Jisho</placeName>."

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>ASSEMBLING OF THE MONKS.</head>
<p>The monks of <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, after receiving the Prince within
their temple, proceeded to fortify themselves by constructing
walls round it and then held another council, saying: "<placeName>Hieizan</placeName>
will not act with us and <placeName>Nara</placeName> has not yet come up. It will not
do to continue thus. Let us go down and attack <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>
to-night: in that case, dividing our force into two parts, the
veterans and the younger men, the elder must go down from
<placeName>Nyoi-ga-mine</placeName> against the back gate of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, while they
detach some swift runners to fire the dwelling houses of
<placeName>Shirakawa</placeName>, so that the people of the capital and the soldiers of
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> will run out in surprise to see what has happened.
Then, when their attention is thus distracted, we must act on the
defensive from the direction of <placeName>Iwasaka</placeName> and <placeName>Sakuramoto</placeName>, while

the younger men and the fiercest fighting monks, must attack
the front gate of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> from <placeName>Matsusaka</placeName> and set fire to the
buildings from the windward side. Then in the melee and
confusion of the onset it ought not to be difficult to burn out the
<persName>Dajo-Nyudo</persName> and take his head." At this point a certain monk
called <persName>Ichi-nyo-bo no Ajari Shinkai</persName>, who did priest's services for
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, bringing about ten others who lived with him, came
forward into the courtyard where they were holding
consultation and gave his opinion as follows: "If you think of acting
thus, one must think you are partisans of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. A plan
like that will not do at all. Surely we must consider the
reputation of our temple as well as the interests of the priests. In
former days the families of <orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName> vied with each other in
upholding the Imperial Family by their might, but of late the
<pb n="190" xml:id="p214-190"/>

fortunes of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> have declined and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have become
supreme in the land, having now stood firm for twenty years like
a tree that no gale can bend. How then can
you hope to succeed in attacking their mansions with so
trifling a force? Consider the matter very carefully. Is it not
better to assemble a large force and proceed with the attack at
a later time ?" And he continued to argue thus with them for a
long time in order to delay the expedition. Then <persName>Joen-bo no Ajari
Kyoshu</persName>, wearing under his robes a body-armour of light green
colour, and a great sword thrust through his girdle in front, and
brandishing a white handled halberd in his hand, burst into the
council. "There is no need of further argument," he exclaimed,
“the founder of our temple, <persName>Temmu Tenno</persName>, while he was yet
Crown Prince, being attacked by <persName>Prince Otomo</persName>, issuing from
the mountains of <placeName>Yoshino</placeName>, passed over the district of <placeName>Uda</placeName>, and
making his way across <placeName>Iga</placeName> and <placeName>Ise</placeName>, with a band of only
seventeen men, being joined by the forces of <placeName>Mino</placeName> and <placeName>Owari</placeName>,
overthrew <persName>Prince Otomo</persName> and eventually ascended the Throne.
There is a saying that a man will have pity on a distressed bird
that takes refuge in his bosom. I don't know about the rest,
but as for me and my followers we go down to attack
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> to-night and die there!" <persName>Enman-in no Taiyu Gen-
kaku</persName> too broke in exclaiming: "Enough of this discussion;
the hour grows late, haste and advance!" So <persName>Gensammi
Nyudo Yorimasa</persName> took command of the elder monks who were
to attack the back gate of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and with him <persName>Joen-bo no
Ajari Kyoshu</persName>, <persName>Rissho-bo no Ajari Nichiin</persName>, <persName>Sotsu-no-Hoin Zenji</persName>
and his disciples <persName>Giho</persName> and <persName>Zenyo</persName>, with about a thousand men,
holding torches in their hands, started off towards <placeName>Nyoi-ga-mine</placeName>.
The leader of those attacking the front gate was <persName>Izu-no-kami
Nakatsuna</persName>, eldest son of <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, and with him was
the second son <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Kanetsuna</persName>, <persName>Rokujo-no-Kurando Nakaie</persName>, his son <persName>Kurando-no-Taro Nakamitsu</persName> and the
soldier monks <persName>Enman-in-no-Taiyu Genkaku</persName>, <persName>Rissei-bo-no-Iga-no-Kimi</persName>, <persName>Horin-in no Oni Sado</persName>, and <persName>Joki-in no Aratosa</persName>, all stout men
<pb n="191" xml:id="p215-191"/>

at arms carrying bow and arrows, swords and halberds,
everyone of them worth a thousand ordinary men, caring not whether
they met god or devil. From <placeName>Byodo-in</placeName> came <persName>Inaba-no-Risshi
Kodaiyu</persName>, <persName>Sumi-no-Rokuro Bo</persName>, <persName>Shima-no-Ajari</persName>, <persName>Tsutsui Hoshi</persName>,
<persName>Kyo-no-Ajari</persName> and <persName>Aku Shonagon</persName>. From <placeName>Kita-no-in</placeName> were <persName>Kon-
go-in no Roku Tengu</persName>, <persName>Shikibu Daiyu</persName>, <persName>Noto</persName>, <persName>Kaga</persName>, <persName>Sado</persName> and
<persName>Bingo</persName>, <persName>Natsui</persName>, <persName>Higo</persName>, <persName>Chonan-in no Chikugo</persName>, <persName>Kaya no Chikuzen</persName>,
<persName>Oya no Toshinaga</persName>, <persName>Gochi-in no Tajima</persName>, and among the sixty
disciples of <persName>Kyoshu</persName>, <persName>Kaga Kojo</persName>, <persName>Gyobu Shunsha</persName>, <persName>Ichiran Hoshi</persName>,
<persName>Tsutsui Jomyo</persName>, <persName>Myoshu</persName>, <persName>Okura-no-Songetsu</persName>, <persName>Sonei</persName>, <persName>Jikei</persName>,
<persName>Rakuju</persName>, <persName>Kanako-bushi no Genei</persName>, and among the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>, <persName>Wata-
nabe-no-Habuku</persName>, <persName>Harima-no-jiro Sazuku</persName>, <persName>Satsuma-no-Hyoye
Choshichi Tonau</persName>, <persName>Kiou Takiguchi</persName>, <persName>Atae-no-Umanojo</persName>, <persName>Tsuzuku-no-Genda</persName>, <persName>Kiyoshi</persName> and <persName>Susumu</persName> with about fifteen hundred
menat-arms. These all set out from <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, but as, after the Prince
had entered, they had made a rampart and moat and set up fences
and palisades, and thrown obstacles of trees across the road, the
moat had to be bridged and the obstacles removed, so that the
night had passed and the cock-crow of approaching dawn was
heard before all was finished and the way was clear. "If it be
now cock-crow," exclaimed <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>, "it will be morning
light when we reach <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. What then is to be done?"
Then <persName>Enman-in no Taiyu Genkaku</persName>, coming forward as before,
said: "Of old <persName>King Sho of Shin</persName> put <persName>Mosho Kun</persName> into bonds,
but he managed to escape with three thousand soldiers by the
help of one of the consorts of <persName>Sho</persName>. Coming to the barrier at
<placeName>Kan</placeName>, however, he found that, as is the custom in foreign
countries, the gate was not accustomed to be opened until cock-crow.
Now among the three thousand soldiers of <persName>Mosho</persName> was one
<persName>Denko</persName>, who was so skilled in imitating the crowing of cocks
that he was nick-named '<persName>Keimei</persName>' (Cock-crow), and he, running
up to a high place, imitated the cock-crow so well that all the
cocks at the barrier hearing it at once crowed in concert. Then
the barrier guards, deceived by the sound, at once opened the
gates and they passed through. So perhaps this cock-crow is
<pb n="192" xml:id="p216-192"/>

only a ruse of the enemy: let us then advance." But as he
finished speaking the dawn began to break mistily, for it was the
time of the short days of the fifth month. Then <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>
replied: "A night attack cannot be made now, and we dare
not provoke a battle with them in broad day, so give the order
to retire." So the attackers of the front gate retired from
<placeName>Matsusaka</placeName> and those of the back gate from <placeName>Nyoi-ga-mine</placeName>. The
young and turbulent priests, declaring that it was the fault of
<persName>Ichi-nyo-bo</persName> who had prolonged their consultations till daybreak,
clamoured for him to be put to death at once, and attacked and
wounded him, and his disciples and followers who strove to
defend him were all wounded also. He, wounded as he was,
managed to crawl away and get to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, though when
they heard his tale there, since there were many tens of
thousands of armed men assembled, they were by no means
perturbed.
</p>
<p>Then the Prince, seeing that <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> had turned against
them, and <placeName>Nara</placeName> had not yet sent their men, since <placeName>Miidera</placeName> alone
could do nothing, on the twenty-third day of the same month
left that temple and started for the <placeName>Southern Capital</placeName>. The
Prince had with him two flutes of Chinese bamboo called '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Semi-
ori</foreign>' and '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Koeda</foreign>.' Of these '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Semiori</foreign>' was made of a bamboo
with joints like a living Cicada (<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Semi</foreign>), which had been sent
from <placeName>China</placeName> as a return gift when in the reign of <persName>Toba-in</persName> much
gold dust had been sent as a present to the Emperor of the <placeName>Sung</placeName>
dynasty. Wondering how such a rare treasure could be well
carved, it had been sent to <persName>Daisei-in-no-Sojo Kakuso</persName> of <placeName>Miidera</placeName>
and placed on the altar while prayer was offered for seven days,
after which it was carved. On one occasion <persName>Takamatsu-no-Chunagon Sanehira-no-Kyo</persName> came to the temple and played on
it, but forgetting it was no ordinary flute, he dropped it to the
ground from his knees, and the flute, feeling the reproach, broke
at the joint like a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Semi</foreign>; so that ever after it was called '<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Semi-
ori</foreign>.' As the Prince excelled so greatly at flute-playing he had
inherited it. But now, thinking that his end was nigh, he
<pb n="193" xml:id="p217-193"/>

deposited it in the <placeName>Kondo Hall</placeName> before <persName>Miroku Bosatsu</persName>. How
sad the thought that it was because he wished to seek the way
of <persName>Miroku Bosatsu</persName> and forsake the world. The Prince gave all
the elder priests leave to stay behind, but the young and
highspirited monks went with him. The following of <persName>Gensammi
Nyudo</persName>, the clan <persName>Watanabe</persName> and the monks of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> made up
in all a force of about fifteen hundred men. Then <persName>Joen-bo-no
Ajari Kyoshu</persName>, leaning on an old man's staff, came into the
presence of the Prince with tears streaming from his eyes: "I had
wished to accompany you always," he said "but my years are
now four-score and so it is very difficult for me to march, but I
am sending my disciple <persName>Gyobu Bo Shunshu</persName>; he is the son of
<persName>Yamanouchi Sado Gyobu-no-jo Toshimichi</persName> of the province of
<placeName>Soshu</placeName>, who at the time of the fighting in <placeName>Heiji</placeName> served the late
<persName>Sama-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName> and was slain at <placeName>Rokujo Kawara</placeName>.
Having some slight connexion with him I brought him up so
that nothing that is in his heart is hidden from me. Take him
therefore and let him serve you always." Then the Prince,
overcome by his feelings, could not refrain from tears and
exclaimed: "What have I done that he should show me such
great kindness ? ”

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12" xml:id="v4_ch12">
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT THE BRIDGE.</head>
<p>Now the Prince rode down to <placeName>Rokutabi</placeName> between <placeName>Uji</placeName> and
<placeName>Miidera</placeName>, and because he had no sleep the previous night they
tore up about six yards of the planking of the bridge at <placeName>Uji</placeName>
and he entered the temple of <placeName>Byodo-in</placeName> and rested there
awhile. The men of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, learning that he was fleeing to
<placeName>Naia</placeName>, at once started off in pursuit to take him and put him to
death. The leaders of their force were <persName>Sahyoye-no-kami Tomo-
mori</persName>, <persName>To-no-Chujo Shigehira</persName> and <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadamori</persName>,
while as commanders of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> there were <persName>Kazusa-no-kami
Tadakiyo</persName>, his son <persName>Kazusa-no-Taro Hangwan Tadatsune</persName>, <persName>Hida-
<pb n="194" xml:id="p218-194"/>

no-kami Kageie</persName>, his son <persName>Hida-no-Taro Hangwan Kagetaka</persName>, <persName>Taka-
hashi-no-Hangwan Nakatsuna</persName>, <persName>Kawachi-no-Hangwan Hidekuni</persName>,
<persName>Musahi-no-Saburo Saemon Arikuni</persName>, <persName>Etchu-no-Jirohyoye Mori-
tsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorohyoye Tadamitsu</persName>, and <persName>Akushichi-hyoye
Kagekiyo</persName> with about twenty eight thousand men in all. Cross-
ing over <placeName>Kobatayama</placeName> they pressed on to the bridge-head of
<placeName>Uji</placeName>. Perceiving that the enemy were at <placeName>Byodo-in</placeName>, they raised
their warcry three times, when they were answered by that of the
Prince's men.
</p>
<p>The vanguard, seeing the danger, raised a cry of
alarm: " Take care! they have torn up the bridge!" But the
rearguard paid no heed and pushed them on with cries of
"Advance! Advance!" so that some two hundred horsemen of
the leading company fell through into the river and perished in
the stream. Then the warriors of both sides, taking their stand
at each end of the bridge, began a duel of archery, and on the
Side of the Prince, <persName>Oya-no-Shuncho</persName>, <persName>Gochiin-no-Tajima</persName>, <persName>Wata-
nabe-no-Habuku</persName>, <persName>Sazuku</persName>, and <persName>Tsuzuku-no-Genda</persName> shot so
powerfully that their shafts pierced the enemy through both shield and
armour. <persName>Gensammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName>, knowing in his heart
that this fight would be his last, went forth in a suit of amour
of blue and white spots worn over his long-sleeved Court <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hita-
tare</foreign>, purposely wearing no helmet on his head, while his son
<persName>Izu-no-kami Nakatsuna</persName> wore a suit of black armour over a
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign> of red brocade, he also leaving his head bare for greater
ease in drawing the bow. Then <persName>Gochiin-no-Tajima</persName>, throwing
away the sheath of his long halberd, strode forth alone on to the
bridge, whereupon the <orgName>Heike</orgName> straightway shot at him fast and
furious. <persName>Tajima</persName>, not at all perturbed, ducking to avoid the
higher ones and leaping up over those that flew low, cut through
those that flew straight with his whirring halberd, so that even
the enemy looked on in admiration. Thus it was that he was
dubbed "<persName>Tajima the arrow cutter</persName>". Another of the soldier
priests, <persName>Tsutsui-no-Jomyo Meishu</persName>, wearing armour laced with
black leather over a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign> of dyed cloth, and a helmet of five
plates, a sword in a black lacquered sheath at his side and a
<pb n="195" xml:id="p219-195"/>

quiver of twenty-four black feathered arrows on his back, his
bow being also of black lacquer, gripping his favourite white
handled halberd in his hand, also sprang forward alone on to the
bridge and shouted in a mighty voice: "Let those at a distance
listen, those that are near can see; I am <persName>Tsutsui Jomyo Meishu</persName>,
the priest; who is there in <placeName>Miidera</placeName> who does not know me, a
warrior worth a thousand men ? Come on anyone who thinks
himself someone, and we will see!" And loosing off his twenty
four arrows like lightning-flashes he slew twelve of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
soldiers and wounded eleven more. One arrow yet remained
in his quiver, but, flinging away his bow, he stripped off his
quiver and threw that after it, cast off his foot-gear, and springing
barefoot on to the beams of the bridge, he strode across. All
were afraid to cross over, but he walked the broken bridge as
one who walks along the street <placeName>Ichijo</placeName> or <placeName>Nijo</placeName> of the <placeName>Capital</placeName>.
With his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">naginata</foreign> he mows down five of the enemy, but with the
sixth the halberd snaps asunder in the midst and flinging it away
he draws his <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">tachi</foreign>, wielding it in the zig-zag style, the interlacing,
cross, reversed dragonfly, waterwheel, and eight-sides-at-once
styles of fencing, and cutting down eight men; but as he
brought down the ninth with an exceeding mighty blow on the
helmet, the blade snapped at the hilt and fell splash into the
water beneath. Then seizing his dirk which was the only
weapon he had left, he plied it as one in the death fury. Now a
retainer of <persName>Joen-bo-no Ajari Kyoshu</persName>, <persName>Ichirai Hoshi</persName> by name, a
man of great strength and courage, was fighting behind <persName>Jomyo</persName>,
but as the beams were so narrow he could not come alongside
him, so placing a hand on the neckpiece of his helmet, he
shouted: “Pardon me <persName>Jomyo</persName>, this is no good,” and springing
over his shoulder to the front fought mightily until he fell.
</p>
<p><persName>Ichirai Hoshi</persName> being killed, <persName>Jomyo-bo</persName> crawled back again and
retired to the <placeName>Byodo-in</placeName>, where he sat down on the grass before
the gate, and stripping off his armour, counted the dints of the
arrows that had struck him. There were sixty three in all, but
of these only five had pierced through, and none of the wounds
<pb n="196" xml:id="p220-196"/>

being very severe, he treated them with cautery; then, covering
his head and changing his clothes, using his broken bow as a
staff he went down on foot to <placeName>Nara</placeName>. Following the example
of <persName>Jomyo-bo</persName>, the soldier monks of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> with the <persName>Watanabe</persName>
clan of <persName>Gensammi Nyudo's</persName> men vied with each other in pressing
forward over the beams of the bridge, and fought till sundown,
some returning with spoil, and some, after being wounded, cutting
themselves open and jumping into the river.
</p>
<p>Then the commander of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>, <persName>Kazusa-no-kami Tada-
kiyo</persName> came to the commander-in-chief of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> forces: "See
here," he said" the battle on the bridge is very fierce; we ought
to ford the river, but after the rains of the fifth month neither
man nor horse can live in the stream; shall we go round by
<placeName>Yodoi</placeName>, <placeName>Moarai</placeName> or <placeName>Kawachiji</placeName>? What is to be done?” Then
<persName>Ashikaga-no-Matataro Tadatsuna</persName>, a young man in his eighteenth
year, spoke saying: "Why not leave the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> of <placeName>India</placeName> or
<placeName>China</placeName> to go to <placeName>Yodo</placeName>, <placeName>Moarai</placeName> or <placeName>Kawachiji</placeName>, for that is not our
way. If we don't rout the enemy that confront us here, the
Prince will get away to <placeName>Nara</placeName>, and then you will have all the
forces of <placeName>Yoshino</placeName> and <placeName>Totsugawa</placeName> to deal with and that will be
no light affair. On the boundary of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> and <placeName>Kozuke</placeName> there
is a great river called the <placeName>Tonegawa</placeName> and there the <persName>Ashikaga</persName> and
the <persName>Chichibu</persName> are always fighting each other, and on one occasion,
when the front were attacking at <placeName>Nagai</placeName> ford and the rear at <placeName>Koga-
sugi</placeName> ford, a certain <persName>Nitta Nyudo</persName> of <placeName>Kozuke</placeName>, who was coming to
the help of the <persName>Ashikaga</persName> from the <placeName>Sugi</placeName> ford, being told by them
that the <persName>Chichibu</persName> had destroyed all the boats that had been
provided to cross, exclaimed: "If we do not ford the river here it
will be a disgrace to our reputation as <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>; to be drowned is
but to die; Forward then!" and using their horses as a raft they
forded the river. As the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign> of the <placeName>East Country</placeName> say: "Keep
your face to the enemy, and when separated by a river, shun the
swift rapids by the bank. This river is neither more nor less
swift and deep than the <placeName>Tonegawa</placeName>, so come along sirs," and he
plunged into the stream. <persName>Ogo</persName>, <persName>Omuro</persName>, <persName>Fukasu</persName>, <persName>Yamakami</persName>,
<pb n="197" xml:id="p221-197"/>

<persName>Nawa-no-Taro</persName>, <persName>Sanuki</persName>, <persName>Hirotsuna</persName>, <persName>Shirodaiyu</persName>, <persName>Onodera-no-Zenji
Taro</persName>, <persName>Heyako-no-Shiro</persName>, and among the younger men <persName>Ubukata-no-jiro</persName>, <persName>Kirifu-no-Rokuro</persName>, and <persName>Tanaka-no-Sota</persName> immediately
dashed in after him with some three hundred men behind them,
shouting the <persName>Ashikaga</persName> warcry.
</p>
<p>"Put the heads of the weaker
horses downstream, those of the stronger upstream!" he
shouted" if the horses keep their feet give them the rein and let
them walk, but if they get off their feet let them have their heads
and swim them; if you are washed downstream stick the butt of
your bow down into the bottom; join hands and go across in
line; if your horse's head gets down pull it up, but don't pull it
up too far or you will fall off backwards; sit tight in the saddle
and keep your feet firm in the stirrups; where the water is slow
and deep get up over the horse's tail; don't shoot while in the
water; if the enemy shoots don't draw bow in return; keep your
head down and your neck-piece well sloped upwards, but not too
far or you will be shot in the crown of the helmet; be light on
the horse and firm against the stream; don't go straight across
or you will be washed away, keep obliquely to the stream.”
Thus advising and encouraging them he brought the whole three
hundred rapidly across without losing a man.

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>THE FATE OF THE PRINCE.</head>
<p>Then <persName>Ashikaga Matataro</persName>, wearing armour with red leather
lacing over a <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign> of russet gold brocade, with a helmet
ornamented with lofty horns, a gold-mounted <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">tachi</foreign> by his side,
and twenty four black and white spotted arrows on his back,
carrying a black lacquered bow lashed with red bands, and riding
on a light brown horse with a gold-mounted saddle on which
was the crest of an owl on an oak bough, stood up in his stirrups
and shouted loudly: "I am <persName>Ashikaga Matataro Takatsuna</persName>,
aged seventeen, son of <persName>Ashikaga no Taro Toshitsuna</persName> of <placeName>Shimo-
tsuke</placeName>, descended in the tenth generation from <persName>Tawara Toda</persName>
<pb n="198" xml:id="p222-198"/>

<persName>Hidesato</persName>, the renowned warrior who gained great fame and
reward for destroying <persName>Masakado</persName> the enemy of the Emperor,
and though it may be at the risk of divine anger that one
without rank or office should draw bow against a Prince of the
Royal House, yet as I owe deep graditude to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> for
many favours, here I stand to meet any on the side of <persName>Gensammi
Nyudo</persName> who dares to face me." And he made an onset and
fought his way within the gate of the <placeName>Byodo-in</placeName>. Then the
commander <persName>Sahyoye-no-kami Tomomori</persName>, seeing this, ordered his
forces to cross over, and about twenty eight thousand horsemen
plunged into the river, so that the rapids of the <placeName>Ujigawa</placeName> were
dammed and stayed by the mass of men and horses, and the
footsoldiers crossing below the horsemen were hardly wetted
above their knees. But everything is carried away by the
natural force of water, so the men of <placeName>Ise</placeName> and <placeName>Iga</placeName>, to the
number of six hundred horsemen, were washed away through
their ranks being broken by the force of the current, and their
armour of various hues, green, scarlet and red, rising and sinking
as they were washed hither and thither in the stream, looked
like the maple leaves on <placeName>Kannabiyama</placeName>, when in late autumn
they are blown by the mountain blasts into the <placeName>Tatsuta</placeName> river
and collect in masses where the flood is dammed. Among
them three gallants, clad in the scarlet armour of a leader of
armies, stuck helplessly in a fish decoy, and <persName>Izu-no-kami</persName>,
watchng them as they struggled in the rapids, composed this stanza :
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Lo! the bright scarlet hue of the mail of the warriors of
Ise;</l>
<l>Now they are stuck like fish, struggling in Uji's decoys."</l>
</lg>
<p>They were <persName>Kuroda-no Gohei Shiro</persName>, <persName>Hino-no-Jiro</persName> and
<persName>Otobe-no-Yashichi</persName>, all men of <placeName>Ise</placeName>, and <persName>Hino-no-Juro</persName>, a veteran
soldier, wedging the butt of his bow into a cleft of the rock,
scrambled out by its aid and then pulled out his two companions,
thus saving their lives.
</p>
<p>Now when the whole force had reached the other side they
advanced and fought their way in through the gate of the <placeName>Byo-do-in</placeName>
<pb n="199" xml:id="p223-199"/>

and in the confusion the Prince attempted to escape toward
<placeName>Nara</placeName>, while <persName>Gensammi's</persName> men the <persName>Watanabe</persName> and the warrior
priests of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> strove to hold back the foe with their bows
and arrows. The veteran warrior <persName>Gensammi</persName>, now more than
three score years and ten, was soon wounded in the right elbow
by an arrow and was about to retire within the temple to die
calmly by his own hand, when a band of the enemy threw
themselves in his way, whereupon his second son <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Kanetsuna</persName> turned to counter them and let his father
escape. His armour laced with Chinese silk was worn over a
<foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">hitatare</foreign> of dark blue brocade, and he rode a cream coloured
horse with a saddle mounted in gold. Then <persName>Kazusa-no-Taro
Hangwan</persName> shot an arrow that struck him beneath the helmet,
and as he staggered at the blow, <persName>Kazusa-no-kami's</persName> son <persName>Jiro
Maru</persName>, a strong and valiant fighter, clad in green armour with a
helmet of three plates on his head, unsheathed his sword and
sprang upon him. They both grappled immediately and fell
together, when <persName>Gendaiyu Hangwan</persName>, who was a powerful man,
gripped <persName>Jiro Maru</persName>, pressed him down and cut off his head, but
just then fourteen or fifteen of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> horsemen came up and
<persName>Kanetsune</persName> was overpowered at last by numbers and slain. <persName>Izu-no-kami Nakatsuna</persName> too, after fighting with reckless bravery,
covered with wounds, retired to the <placeName>Tsuridono</placeName> of the <placeName>Byodo-in</placeName>
and there put an end to himself, his head being taken up by
<persName>Shimokawabe-no-Tosaburo Kiyochika</persName> and thrown under the
verandah. <persName>Rokujo-no-Kurando Nakaie</persName> and his son <persName>Nakamitsu</persName>
also fought valiantly until they were slain. This <persName>Nakaie</persName> was the
eldest son of the late <persName>Tatewaki Senjo Yoshikata</persName>, and when his
father was killed, being an orphan, he was adopted by <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName> out of pity, and now, faithful to their long compact,
they both died together. <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, calling <persName>Watanabe
Choshichi Tanau</persName>, bade him strike off his head, but he refused,
overcome by the thought of cutting off his master's head while
alive, but offered to do so after he had committed suicide. Then
<persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, turning to the West, put his hands together
<pb n="200" xml:id="p224-200"/>

and repeated the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">Nembutsu</foreign> ten times in a loud voice, after which
he composed this sad stanza;
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"Like a fossil tree from which we gather no flowers</l>
<l>Sad has been my life, fated no fruit to produce."</l>
</lg>
<p>"Ho! how now,"
And with these last words he thrust the point of his sword
into his belly, and bowing his face to the ground pierced himself
through and died. It was not a time when people usually make
poems, but as he had been extremely fond of this pastime from
his youth up, so even at the hour of death he did not forget it.
<persName>Choshichi Tonau</persName> took his head, and fastening stones to it sunk it
in a deep part of the <placeName>Ujigawa</placeName>. Now though the <orgName>Heike</orgName> <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">samurai</foreign>
had been strictly ordered to take the <persName>Takiguchi Kiou</persName> alive, yet
he, after fighting with great bravery, being very severely
wounded, at last cut himself open and died. <persName>Enman-in-no-Taiyu
Genkaku</persName>, thinking that the Prince had by this time got far away,
gripping his sword in one hand and his halberd in the other,
cleft his way through the midst of the foe and leaping into the
river, without relinquishing any of his arms, dived beneath the
water and emerged safely on the other side. Then ascending to
a high place he shouted with a loud voice: "Ho! how now,
my lords of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, see I have got thus far!" after which he
returned to <placeName>Miidera</placeName>. Now <persName>Hida-no-kami Kageie</persName>. a veteran
soldier, suspecting that Prince would certainly attempt to flee to
<placeName>Nara</placeName> under cover of the fighting, rode hard on his track with
four or five hundred men in full armour, and as he expected,
overtook him in front of the <foreign xml:lang="jpn-Latn">torii</foreign> of <placeName>Komyozan</placeName> with his escort
of about thirty horsemen. As the arrows flew like rain no one
could tell whose it was, but one of the arrows of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
struck the Prince in the side so that he fell from his horse,
whereupon they killed him and cut off his head. <persName>Oni Sado</persName>,
<persName>Aratosa</persName>, <persName>Kodaiyu</persName>, and <persName>Gyobu-no-Shunshu</persName> who accompanied
him, not wishing to live after their master, threw themselves
upon the enemy and died fighting together. Among them his
foster-brother, <persName>Rokujo-no-suke no Taiyu Munenobu</persName>, jumped into
the pond at <placeName>Niino</placeName>, and hiding his face among the waterweed, lay

<pb n="201" xml:id="p225-201"/>

there trembling. Soon after the <orgName>Heike</orgName> came riding back again
to the number of four or five hundred horsemen, laughing and
shouting as they rode, and peeping out he could see in the midst
of them a headless corpse in white clothing born on a shutter.
It was the Prince without doubt, for in his girdle was the flute
'Koeda' which he had bidden them bury with him in the coffin
if he died. He earnestly wished to rush out and throw himsell
on the body, but fear restrained him, and after the enemy had all
passed by he came out of the pond, and wringing out his wet
garments returned weeping to the capital, where there was none
who did not hold him in aversion.
</p>
<p>
Now about seven thousand soldier priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName> in full
armour had gone forth to meet the Prince, and while the
vanguard reached as far as <placeName>Kozu</placeName> and the rearguard was still
surging out of the southern gate of the <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName>, they heard that
the Prince had been slain before the torii of <placeName>Komyozan</placeName>, alas!
but fifty cho distant from <placeName>Kozu</placeName>. So, unable to do any more,
they halted, lamenting that they had not come up in time.

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>THE YOUNG PRINCE BECOMES A MONK.</head>
<p>The <persName>Heike</persName> soldiers, sticking the heads of the followers of
<persName>Prince Mochihito</persName> and <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>, the <persName>Watanabe</persName> and the
monks of <placeName>Miidera</placeName>, about five hundred in all, on the points of
their swords and halberds, returned to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> towards
evening, flourishing them in the air and shouting exultantly. The
head of <persName>Gensammi</persName> himself could not be found, for it had been
sunk in the waters of the <placeName>Ujigawa</placeName> by <persName>Choshichi Tonau</persName>, but after
searching hither and thither all those of his sons were recovered.
As to that of the Prince, it could not be identified, since there
was no one there sufficiently familiar with him to recognize it.
The Chief Court Physician <persName>Tenyaku-no-kami Sadanari</persName>, having
been called to attend the Prince when he was sick the year
before, could have identified him, but illness prevented him from
<pb n="202" xml:id="p226-202"/>

answering the summons. Then one of the Prince's favourite
consorts was sent for to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, and as she had borne him
several children and they were much attached to each other, she
could not well make a mistake. Thus it was that, after only one
glance, she buried her face in her sleeve and burst into tears, so
that they knew that it was indeed the Prince.
</p>
<p>
Now this Prince had many children by different consorts
and among them he had a son of seven years old and a daughter
of five by a lady called <persName>Sammi-no-Tsubone</persName>, daughter of <persName>Iyo-no-
kami Morinori</persName>, who was living with her children at the Palace of
the <persName>Princess Hachijo-no-Nyoin</persName>, and <persName>Kiyomori</persName> ordered his brother
<persName>Ike-no-Chunagon Yorimori</persName> to tell her to send the little Prince to
him at once, though the daughter might remain. To this <persName>Hachi-
jo-no-Nyoin</persName> replied that the child's nurse had fled away with
him in a panic that very morning and he was nowhere to be
found. On this being reported to <persName>Kiyomori</persName> he ordered soldiers
to be sent to the Palace to search. Now the wife of <persName>Yorimori</persName>
was a lady called <persName>Saisho Dono</persName>, the foster sister of this <persName>Hachijo-no-Nyoin</persName>, and they had been very friendly with each other, but
it happened that shortly before this they had become somewhat
estranged. Then the little Prince said to the <persName>Nyoin</persName>: "It seems
that great trouble may befall you on my account, so pray send me
back quickly." "Ah!" exclaimed the <persName>Nyoin</persName> weeping, "how
very sad it is that a child of seven or eight year who knows
nothing of the world should be so affected by this calamity as to
say such a thing. Alas, in vain have I brought him up this six or
seven years that this fate should now befall him," and she wept
unrestrainedly; but as <persName>Norimori-no-Kyo</persName> kept on repeating his
demand, at last, as nothing else could be done, she delivered him
up. His mother <persName>Sammi-no-Tsubone</persName> too was greatly grieved
to think that she was parting from him for ever, but, as it was
inevitable, weeping bitterly she put on his clothes and patted and
arranged his hair before sending him away, feeling the while like
one in a dream, while all the household from the <persName>Nyoin</persName> to the
ladies-in-waiting and the maidservants buried their faces in their
<pb n="203" xml:id="p227-203"/>

sleeves and wept in concert. <persName>Yorimori-no-Kyo</persName>, taking the child
with him in a car, brought him to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> : then the former
<persName>Udaisho Munemori-no-Kyo</persName> when he saw him spoke thus to his
father the <persName>Nyudo</persName> : "Surely this is the retribution from a
previous existence; just to look on the young Prince makes one
feel how pathetic is his case; if there be no objection, grant him
his life and hand him over to my keeping." "In that case,"
replied the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, "he must be put away in a monastery.'
Then <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName> sent a report of this sentence to <persName>Hachi-
jo-no-Nyoin</persName>, and she made no objection but bade them do so
without delay. So the little Prince retired from the world and
entered the way of Buddha, becoming a disciple of the Abbot of
<placeName>Ninnaji</placeName>, In after days he was known as <persName>Yasui-no-Miya no Dai-
sojo Toson</persName>, chief priest of the temple of <placeName>Toji</placeName> in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>. <persName>Prince
Takakura</persName> had also another son in <placeName>Nara</placeName>, and he also was made
a monk by his guardian <persName>Sanuki-no-kami Shigehide</persName>, who
accompanied him to the <placeName>North Country</placeName>. But <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>, when
he came down to the capital, had his priestly vows revoked and
brought him with him to make him Emperor, so that he was
called 'the Kiso Prince' or 'the Prince of the revoked vows',
and also, because he lived at <placeName>Yorino</placeName> in the vicinity of <placeName>Saga</placeName>, he
was known as the Prince of <placeName>Yorino</placeName>.
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><placeName>Ninnaji</placeName>. A temple to the N.W of <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, whither <persName>Uda Tenno</persName> retired ;
it had a special connexion with the Court, as its abbot was a Royal Prince.</note>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><placeName>Toji</placeName>. or the Eastern Temple. So called because it lay east of the
Shujaku Gate of the Palace.</note>
<p>
In old times there was a physiognomist named <persName>Tojo</persName> who
prophecied that both <persName>Fujiwara Yorimichi</persName> and his younger
brother <persName>Norimichi</persName> who were Kampaku under three Emperors
would live to the age of eighty, and so it happened. Also that
<persName>Sotsu-no-Uchi no Otodo</persName> (<persName>Fujiwara Korechika</persName>) had the face of
one who would be exiled, and so it turned out. Moreover
<persName>Shotoku Taishi</persName> declared that the physiognomy of <persName>Shushun
Tenno</persName> was that of one who would die a violent death, and he
was killed by the minister <persName>Umako</persName>. Though what the physiogno-
<pb n="204" xml:id="p228-204"/>

mists predicted did not always come to pass, yet it seems that
those in former ages were the more accurate. (This because
people said; " Has not the Physiognomy Shonagon made a
mistake ?")
</p>
<p>
At a later period too, though <persName>Kenmei Shinno</persName> and <persName>Guhei
Shinno</persName> were both the sons of wise and pious Emperors, yet they
did not suceed to the Throne, but still they made no rebellion.
Also in the case of <persName>Sukehito Shinno</persName>, the third son of the <persName>Retired
Emperor Go-Sanjo</persName>, an exceedingly clever and distinguished
Prince, who was nominated by his father in his will to suceed
him on the Throne when the <persName>Retired Emperor Shirakawa</persName> was
only Crown Prince, and yet, on account of some decision of
<persName>Shirakawa</persName> he did not suceed; and the son of this <persName>Sukehito
Shinno</persName>, taking the surname of <persName>Genji</persName>, rose from having no rank
at all to the third rank and became Chujo, being known as
<persName>Sammi Chujo</persName>. Except in the case of <persName>Yosei-in Dainagon Sada-
mu-no-Kyo</persName>, son of <persName>Saga Tenno</persName>, this is the first time that a
member of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> family has thus risen from nothing to the
third rank. This was <persName>Hanazono Sadaijin Arihito Ko</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Now the priests who had made special prayer for the
crushing of this rebellion of <persName>Prince Takakura</persName> were well rewarded for
their pains, the Chamberlain <persName>Kiyomine</persName>, son of the former <persName>Udai-
sho Munemori-no-Kyo</persName>, being raised to the third rank at the age
of twelve years. At the same age his father <persName>Munemori</persName> had
been only Hyoye-no-Suke, and with the exception of the son of
the Kampaku there was no precedent for a boy of twelve
holding such high rank. And the record of it ran : These are
rewards for the putting to death of <persName>Minamoto no Mochihito</persName> and
<persName>Gensammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName> and his sons." Not only were they
impious enough to shoot a real son of the Senior Retired Em-
peror, but they had the effrontery to describe him by the name
of an ordinary subject. For this '<persName>Minamoto no Mochihito</persName> '
meant <persName>Prince Takakura</persName>.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15" xml:id="v4_ch15">
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>NUE.</head>
<p>Now this <persName>Gensammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName> was the fifth
generation from <persName>Settsu-no-kami Raiko</persName>, the grandson of <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Yoritsuna</persName> and son of <persName>Hyogo-no-kami Nakamasa</persName>. At the
time of the fight of Hogen he was on the side of the Imperial
Army, but received no reward: also in the rebellion of Heiji he
forsook all his kinsmen and fought on the same side, but his
recompense was small. For long he only held the title of Daida
Shugo or Guard of the Palace, and had not the privilege of
entry to Court, but after he was old he obtained the privilege
by composing the following verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Standing far off outside as guard to the Holy of Holies</l>
<l>How can I see the moon, hid in the shade of the trees?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
For this he was granted the lower grade of the Upper Fourth
Rank, and so he remained for some time until, wishing to
proceed to the Third Rank, he made another stanza, thus:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"So I go through the world as one who is picking up acorns,</l>
<l>Under the boughs of the oak, doomed not to rise any higher."</l>
</lg>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">Picking up acorns. (shii) there is a, word play on the double meaning
of 'shii' oak, here referring to its fruit, and Shi-i Fourth Rank, so that it
would then mean as one who has only picked up the Fourth Rank."</note>
<p>
Some time afterwards he retired from the world and was known
as <persName>Gensammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName>, (Minamoto Third Rank), being
seventy-five the same year. Among the many deeds of renown
that <persName>Yorimasa</persName> performed in the course of his life the most
remarkable was in the Ninpei period when the <persName>Emperor Konoe-
in</persName> was on the Throne. Every night the Emperor was frightened
by something, and though he summoned the most celebrated of
the priests and had them chant those Sutras most potent for
exorcism it was all of no effect. The time that the Emperor
was thus troubled was about the hour of the Ox (2 a.m.), when
<pb n="206" xml:id="p230-206"/>

a black cloudy mass used to come up from the direction of the
wood of <placeName>Higashi Sanjo</placeName> and hover over the <placeName>Palace</placeName>, and it always
affrighted him. So a Council of Courtiers was held about it.
Now in former days in the period of Kwanji, when <persName>Horikawa-in</persName>
was on the Throne, this Emperor was terrified in the very same
way, and <persName>Yoshiie Ason</persName>, who was Commander of the Guards at
that time, took up his position on the verandah of the <placeName>Shishinden</placeName>,
and at the usual time of the apparition twanged his bowstring
three times and declaimed in a loud and terrible voice: "I am
<persName>Minamoto Yoshiie</persName> formerly <persName>Mutsu-no-kami</persName>," so that the hair of
those that the heard it stood on end, whereat the distress of His
Majesty was relieved. So according to this precedent <persName>Yorimasa</persName>
was chosen from among the warriors of the <orgName>Taira</orgName> and Minamoto
families. He was at this time only Hyoye-no-kami, and on
being informed of it he said: "From former times samurai
have been stationed at the <placeName>Palace</placeName> to drive away rebels and to
smite those who disobey the Imperial Commands, but it is the
first time that I have ever heard of their having apparitions to
deal with." But as it was an Imperial Order he went. He
took with him his most trusted retainer <persName>I-no-Hayata</persName> <placeName>Totomi</placeName>,
who carried an arrow feathered with the underfeathers of an
eagle's wing, while he himself, wearing a double kariginu, carried
his lacquered bow and two barbed arrows and proceeded to the
verandah of the <placeName>Shishinden</placeName>. The reason for his taking two
arrows was that one <persName>Masayori-no-Kyo</persName>, who was at that time
Sashoben, had suggested that he be chosen to deal with the
monster, and so <persName>Yorimasa</persName> had determined that if he failed to hit
the creature with the one arrow he would shoot the other
straight at <persName>Masayori's</persName> neck. After a while, as has been described,
at the time when the Emperor was always wont to be alarmed,
a mass of black cloud came from the direction of the wood by
<placeName>Higashi Sanjo</placeName> and floated over the top of the <placeName>Palace</placeName>. <persName>Yorimasa</persName>,
looking up, saw a strange shape in the midst of the cloud and
determining not to live if he missed, took an arrow, and earnestly
repeating in his heart the invocation to the god of war, 'Namu
<pb n="207" xml:id="p231-207"/>

<persName>Hachiman Dai-Bosatsu</persName>!' drew the bow mightily and let fly.
The arrow flew straight to the mark and <persName>Yorimasa</persName> gave a
loud shout of triumph as <persName>I-no-Hayata</persName> came running up, seized
the thing as it fell and, pressing it down with might and main,
pierced it through nine times with his sword. Then many others
ran up with torches, and when they came to inspect it they
found it was a most horrible monster with a monkey's head, the
body of a badger, the tail of a snake and feet like a tiger, its
voice being like a Nue bird. The Emperor, out of his great
gratitude to <persName>Yorimasa</persName>, presented him with a famous sword called
'Shishio' or Lion King. This was handed to the <persName>Sadaijin
Yorinaga</persName> to give to <persName>Yorimasa</persName>, and as His Excellency proceeded
to come half-way down the steps of the <placeName>Palace</placeName>, it being then
the tenth day of the fourth month, the voice of a cuckoo
that chanced to fly overhead echoed twice or thrice, whereupon
the <persName>Sadaijin</persName> exclaimed:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"How does the cuckoo too wish to make a name in the heaven."</l>
</lg>
<p>
But <persName>Yorimasa</persName>, sticking out his right knee and spreading out
his left sleeve, looked up at the crescent moon in the sky
and replied:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Then let the bow-shaped moon let fly a shaft at the bird."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Then he received the sword and retired.
</p>
<p>
This <persName>Yorimasa-no-Kyo</persName>, beside being a peerless warrior, was
also a distinguished poet and much admired by his
contemporaries. The bird they put into a boat and set it adrift. In
the period Oho also, in the reign of <persName>Nijo-in</persName> a monstrous bird
called Nue was heard to cry in the <placeName>Palace</placeName>, so that the heart of
the Emperor was troubled, and so as had been done before he
summoned <persName>Yorimasa</persName>. It was the evening of the twentieth day
of the fifth month. The Nue only flew once over the <placeName>Palace</placeName>
and its voice was not heard a second time.
It was so dark that
nothing could be seen and therefore there was nowhere to aim,
so <persName>Yorimasa</persName> took a great whirring arrow and shot it over the
roof of the <placeName>Palace</placeName> at the place where the cry had been heard.
<pb n="208" xml:id="p232-208"/>

The Nue, alarmed at the sound of the arrow, sprang up into the
sky, when <persName>Yorimasa</persName>, quickly seizing a smaller whirring arrow,
let it fly. It struck and brought down the creature, whereupon
all those in the <placeName>Palace</placeName> came rushing out shouting confusedly.
On this occasion <persName>Yorimasa</persName> received a robe of honour from the
Emperor. This time it was <persName>Oi-no-Mikado no Udaijin Kinyoshi</persName>
who received it to present to <persName>Yorimasa</persName>. "In ancient <placeName>China</placeName>,"
said he in admiration, "<persName>Yo-yu</persName> shot a wild goose beyond the
clouds, but now <persName>Yorimasa</persName> has shot a Nue in the rain :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Famous the deed spite the dark in the rainy season of springtime."</l>
</lg>
<p>
"Nay at the time it seemed twilight had scarcely gone by,”
replied <persName>Yorimasa</persName> as he received the robe and retired. Then,
having received the fief of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, he appointed his eldest son <persName>Naka-
tsuna</persName> as its Governor, and having attained the Third Rank was
living at ease on his estates in <placeName>Tamba</placeName> and <placeName>Wakasa</placeName>, when he
started this vain revolt and perished with the Prince and his
sons and grandsons.

<head>THE BURNING OF MIIDERA.</head>
<p>The priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> who had formerly behaved in a
disorderly manner were now peaceful and quiet, whereas <placeName>Nara</placeName> and
<placeName>Miidera</placeName>, since they had received and lent their support to the
Prince, had put themselves in the position of enemies of the
Throne. Therefore it was resolved to proceed against both
monasteries, but, with the intention of attacking <placeName>Miidera</placeName> first,
<persName>Sahyoye-no-kami Tomomori</persName> with <persName>Satsuma-no-kami</persName> as his Lieute-
nant marched against the <placeName>Onjoji</placeName> with about ten thousand men.
At the monastery about a thousand soldier-monks, arming
themselves, made a shield-barrier, threw up a barricade of felled
trees and awaited them. At the hour of the Hare (6. a.m.) they
began to draw their bows, and the battle continued the whole
day, until when evening came on three hundred of the monks and
<pb n="209" xml:id="p233-209"/>

their men had fallen. Then the fight went on in the darkness,
and the Imperial forces forced their way into the monastery
buildings and set them on fire.

the Holy Sutras, called the Issai Kyo, which <persName>Jito</persName> had brought
from <placeName>China</placeName>, and two thousand Buddhist statues, were suddenly
reduced to ashes. It seemed as if the Five Pleasures of Heaven

sixty years worshipped it, had given over to <persName>Jito Daishi</persName>. This
image is said to have come down to earth from the Jewel Palace

of the <placeName>Toshita Heaven</placeName>, the fourth of the Six Heavens of Desire,
and to here await the far off time of the revelation of <persName>Miroku</persName>
under the sacred Dragon Flower. Indeed a most extraordinary
matter! As the <persName>Daishi</persName> here established the three symbols of a
well, flowers, and water, as holy memorials that it was a place
efficacious in teaching and baptism, it was called <placeName>Miidera</placeName> (Temple
of the Three Wells). Such a holy place it was and now it has
come to nothing. In an instant the Law of Tendai and Shingon
was destroyed, no trace is left of its stately buildings, the Halls of
the Law are done away, the sound of the bell is heard no longer,
the flowers of the summer preaching have vanished and the
plashing of the holy water sounds no more. The aged and virtuous
teachers preach the Law no longer, and the multitudes of disciples
have forsaken their studies. The Lord Abbot <persName>Enkei Shinno</persName> is
dismissed from his office of Betto of <placeName>Tennoji</placeName> and thirteen other chief
priests must vacate their posts, and all are committed to the
custody of the Kebiishi, while thirty priests, including <persName>Tsutsui
Jomyo Hoshi</persName>, are sent into exile. Such an upheaval and
disorder in the Empire was no ordinary matter and all considered it
a portent of the fall of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> supremacy.

<head>THE CHANGE OF CAPITAL.</head>
<p>It was decided that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> should proceed to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> on the third day of the sixth month of the fourth year of
Jisho. People thought that the change of capital was likely to
take place about this time, but as they had not expected that
it would be fixed so soon, there was a great uproar in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>
among all classes. Then, after having been arranged for the
third day, it was anticipated by one day and finally settled for
the second. At the hour of the Hare (6. a.m.) on the second day
the Imperial Palanquin was in readiness; the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was now
three years old and owing to his tender years could not but
acquiesce in anything. When the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was a child it was
the custom that the <persName>Dowager Empress</persName> should go with him in the
Palanquin, but this time the precedent was not followed and the
<persName>Imperial Nurse Sotsu-no-Suke</persName> alone went with him. The <persName>Em-
press Dowager</persName>, the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> and the <persName>former Emperor
Takakura</persName> also went in the procession. They were accompanied
by the <persName>Sessho</persName>, the <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> and all the <persName>Court Nobles</persName>, and all
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house headed by the <persName>Dajo Nyudo</persName> himself went with
them. On the following day they arrived at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, and the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> proceeded to the country seat of <persName>Ike-no-Chunagon
Yorimori</persName>, the younger brother of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, and took up his
abode there. On the fourth day the Upper Second Rank was
conferred on <persName>Yorimori</persName> as a reward for the services of his house,
so that he was promoted over the head of the <persName>Udaisho Yoshi-
michi-no-Kyo</persName> the son of the <persName>Udaijin Kanezane</persName>, this being the
first time that the second son of an ordinary subject was ever
advanced over the son of the house of a <persName>Sessho Kwampaku</persName>.

Now the <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName>, though he had changed his

mind and brought back the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to the <placeName>Capital</placeName> from the <placeName>Toba
Palace</placeName>, enraged by the rebellion of <persName>Prince Takakura</persName>, had His
Majesty again moved to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, and, building a wooden
chamber eighteen feet square, surrounded by a foursquare
wooden fence having only one opening in it, he confined him there,
and appointed <persName>Harada-no-Taiyu Tanenao</persName> to keep guard over
him. As it was by no means easy for anyone to gain access to
it the young men nicknamed it <term>Ro-no-Gosho</term>," or
"The
Prison Palace". An abominable and pathetic thing even to
hear of. "As for me," quoth the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, "I have not the least
desire to take any part in the government; all I wish is that I
may be allowed to wander at will from temple to temple for
consolation." But there seemed altogether no end to the evil
deeds of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>; ever since the period Angen they had gone
on sending <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Ministers</roleName> into exile or putting them to
death: they had banished the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> and put the <persName>Nyudo's</persName>
son-in-law in his place, and shut up the <persName>Ho-o</persName> in the <placeName>Seinan
Detached Palace</placeName>, and then they had even dared to put to death
<persName>Prince Takakura</persName>, so that people said that changing the <placeName>Capital</placeName>
was the only thing left for them to do. But to change the <placeName>Capital</placeName>
was by no means without precedent. <persName>Jimmu Tenno</persName>, who was
the fourth son of <persName>Hiko-nagisa-take-ugaya-fuki-aezu-no-mikoto</persName> the
fifth Earthly Deity, and whose mother was <persName>Tama-yori-hime</persName> the
daughter of the <persName>Sea-God</persName>, being the descendant of twelve
generations of Gods and the ancestor of a hundred earthly sovereigns,
in the year of the cock in the cycle Kanoto succeeded to the

<placeName>Hyuga</placeName>, and in the tenth month of the fifty ninth year, the year
of the ram of the cycle Tsuchinoto, subduing the East, he took
up his abode in <placeName>Toyo-ashi-hara-no-naka-tsu-kuni</placeName>, giving it the
name of <placeName>Yamato</placeName>. Then, having viewed the mountain of <placeName>Unebi</placeName>,
he made there his Imperial Capital, and clearing and subduing
the land of <placeName>Kashihara</placeName>, he built therein his Royal Palace, calling
it the <placeName>Kashihara Palace</placeName>. Since this age generation after
generation of Sovereigns have removed their Capitals to many sites in
various provinces to the number of more than thirty times, yea
even unto forty. From <persName>Jimmu Tenno</persName> to <persName>Keiko Tenno</persName> twelve
generations of Sovereigns made their Capitals in the provinces of
<placeName>Yamato</placeName> and did not remove to another province, but in the first
year of <persName>Seimu Tenno</persName> the Capital was changed to the province
of <placeName>Omi</placeName> and set up in the district of <placeName>Shiga</placeName>.
In the second year
of <persName>Chuai Tenno</persName> it was changed to the district of <placeName>Toyoura</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Nagato</placeName>, and while the Capital was in this province
the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> died and his Consort the <persName>Empress Jingo</persName> succeeded
to the Throne aud reigned as Empress, subduing the lands of
<placeName>Kikai</placeName>, <placeName>Korai</placeName> and <placeName>Keitan</placeName> and receiving the submission of the
foreign armies. Then, returning to her country she gave birth
to a Prince in the district of <placeName>Mikasa</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Chikuzen</placeName>,
wherefore that place was called <placeName>Umi-no-Miya</placeName>, and this Prince,
we speak it with reverence, is the god <persName>Hachiman</persName>, and when he
succeeded to the Throne he was known as <persName>Ojin Tenno</persName>.
After-
wards the <persName>Empress Jingo</persName> removed to the province of <placeName>Yamato</placeName>
and abode in the <placeName>Palace of Iware-no-waka-zakura</placeName>, while <persName>Ojin
Tenno</persName> resided at the <placeName>Palace of Akari</placeName> in <placeName>Karushima</placeName> in the same

<persName>Tenno</persName> the Capital was again changed to the province of <placeName>Yamato</placeName>,
and established in the destrict of <placeName>Tochi</placeName>. In the first year of
<persName>Hansei Tenno</persName> it was removed to the province of <placeName>Kawachi</placeName> and
the Palace was built at <placeName>Shibagaki</placeName>. In the forty second year of
<persName>Ingyo Tenno</persName> the Capital was once more changed to <placeName>Yamato</placeName> and
the Palace was established at <placeName>Asuka</placeName> in <placeName>Tobutori</placeName>. In the twenty
first year of <persName>Yuryaku Tenno</persName> it was again moved to <placeName>Asakura</placeName>
in <placeName>Hase</placeName> of the same province. In the fifth year of <persName>Keitei Tenno</persName>
it was changed to <placeName>Tsutsuki</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Yamashiro</placeName> and
twelve years afterwards the Palace was built in <placeName>Otokuni</placeName>. In
the first year of <persName>Senkwa Tenno</persName> it was removed again to <placeName>Yamato</placeName>
and the Palace was established at <placeName>Iruno</placeName> of <placeName>Hinokuma</placeName>. In the
first year of the Great Reform of <persName>Kotoku Tenno</persName> it was changed
te <placeName>Nagara</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName> and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> dwelt in
the <placeName>Palace of Toyosaki</placeName>. In the second year of <persName>Saimei Tenno</persName> it
was again removed to <placeName>Yamato</placeName> and the Palace set up at <placeName>Okamoto</placeName>.
In the sixth year of <persName>Tenchi Tenno</persName> the Capital was made again in
<placeName>Omi</placeName> and the Palace built at <placeName>Otsu</placeName>. In the first year of <persName>Temmu
Tenno</persName> it was brought back to <placeName>Yamato</placeName> and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> dwelt
at the <placeName>South Palace of Okamoto</placeName> and it was called <placeName>Kiyomihara-no-Mikado</placeName>. The two <persName>Emperors Jito</persName> and <persName>Mommu</persName> dwelt in the
<placeName>Palace of Fujiwara</placeName>. From <persName>Gemmyo</persName> to <persName>Kwonin Tenno</persName> seven
generations had their abode at <placeName>Nara</placeName>, but in the time of <persName>Kwammu
Tenno</persName>, on the third day of the tenth month of the third year of
Enryaku, the <placeName>Nara Capital</placeName> was removed from the village of
<placeName>Kasuga</placeName> to <placeName>Nagaoka</placeName> in <placeName>Yamashiro</placeName>, and on the first month of the
tenth year the <persName>Dainagon Fujiwara no Oguromaro</persName>, and the <persName>Sangi
Sadaiben Ki no Kosami</persName>, sent the <persName>Dai-Sozo Genkei</persName> and others to
inspect the village of <placeName>Uda</placeName> in the district of <placeName>Kadono</placeName> in the same
province. Then they both made the following report to the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>: "Having inspected the condition of the locality, we
find that it is a most convenient site for the Capital, for it has on
the four quarters suitable place for the four deities, Shoryu on

the left, Byakko on the right, Shujaku in front and Gembu
behind." Therefore, having reported this to the deity <persName>Kamo
Daimyojin</persName> who dwelt in the district of <placeName>Otagi</placeName>, on the twenty first
day of the eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Enryaku the
Capital was removed from <placeName>Nagaoka</placeName> to this site. And from this
time to the present day there have been thirty two generations
of Sovereigns during a period of three hundred and eighty years.
Since that time many Sovereigns have changed the Capital to
many places, but no other spot is so excellent as this, and
<persName>Kwammu Tenno</persName>, deeply convinced of this fact, ordered his
<roleName>Ministers</roleName> and all the able men of the country to have an image
of clay 8 feet high made to stand perpetually, and to attire it in
helmet and armour of iron and put a bow and arrows of iron in
its hand, adjuring it to protect the capital if in ages to come
anyone should try to change it to any other province. It was buried
on the top of <placeName>Higashiyama</placeName> in a standing position looking toward
the west, and this mound, whenever any great event was to
happen, would stir and give forth sounds. It is called <placeName>Shogun-
zuka</placeName> and is there to this day. And this Capital he gave the
name of <placeName>Heianjo</placeName>, that is the city of peace and security. It ought
to have been greatly revered by the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, for <persName>Kwammu Tenno</persName>
was the sovereign from whom their house had its origin, and it
was very foolish of them, without any good reason, to remove
to another province the Capital that their Imperial Ancestor so
much respected. Once in the time of of <persName>Saga Tenno</persName>, his
predecessor on the Throne, the <persName>Emperor Heijo</persName>, persuaded by the
<persName>Naishi-no-kami, Fujiwara Kusuri</persName>, attempted to change it, but as
the <roleName>Ministers</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName> and all the people were opposed to
it he did not carry out his plan, so how impious was it of this
<persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName>, a mere subject, to dare to remove the
Capital that the Sacred Sovereign would not change. Most
splendid and auspicious was the <placeName>Ancient Capital</placeName>; above it rose
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName> its tutelary deity making soft the sunlight; on all sides
the great temples ranged their roofs, protecting it with their holy
influence, while around it the farmers and townsfolk lived in

peaceful security on the Imperial Domains. But now few wagons
plough their way over the deserted roads, and but an
occasional passer-by is to be seen in some lowly equipage. The houses
of the city that formerly jostled each other for room are now
daily becoming fewer and more ruinous; broken up and made
into rafts they float down the <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and <placeName>Katsuragawa</placeName>, and the
furniture and possessions of their owners are piled up on boats
and brought down to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>. Ah! how sad to see the
<placeName>Flower Capital</placeName> thus turn into an expanse of rice-fields. Who
wrote them I know not, but these two stanzas were found affixed
to a pillar of the deserted <placeName>Palace</placeName>.

<placeName>Wada-no-No</placeName> to plan the nine avenues of the new city, but on so
doing they found that, though there was sufficient space for five
avenues, there was none left for any beyond. On their returning
and reporting this to the Throne, a Council of Courtiers was
held to consider the matter, and though some suggested <placeName>Inna-

<placeName>Koyano</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, yet in the end nothing was

decided. As the thoughts of all still lingered about the old
capital, and the new one was not yet fixed, everyone felt unsettled
and distracted. The old inhabitants of the district were
distressed at losing their land, while those who migrated to it were
troubled by the difficulties of building; indeed it all seemed like
an evil dream. Then the <persName>Saisho-no-Chujo Michichika</persName> said:
"In <placeName>China</placeName> there appears to have been a capital built with three
wide avenues and twelve gates, so why can we not build the
<placeName>Palace</placeName> in a city of five avenues? At any rate let us build a
temporary <placeName>Palace</placeName>." Thereupon the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, after a Council of
Courtiers had been held, ordered <persName>Gojo-no-Dainagon Kunitsuna</persName>
to use the income of the province of <placeName>Suwo</placeName> and build the <placeName>Palace</placeName>.
Now this <persName>Kunitsuna</persName> was a noble of exceeding great wealth, so
that he would not be at all embarrassed by having to build
the <placeName>Palace</placeName>, but in using the income of the province it seemed
hardly likely that the people would escape hardship.
</p>
<p>
On account of all these critical happenings the Ceremony
of the Accession of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was put off; indeed when the
land was thus in confusion owing to the change of capital and
the building of a new <placeName>Palace</placeName>, the time was highly unsuitable
In ancient times, in the days of a certain most revered Sovereign,
the <placeName>Palace</placeName> was built with a thatched roof without even any
eaves, and, noticing that little smoke went up from the houses
of the people, the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> remitted the taxes, thus showing
mercy to his subjects and succouring the land. So also we find
an example of the same kind in <placeName>China</placeName> where in <placeName>So</placeName> the flowery
terraces of the <placeName>Shokwa Palace</placeName> devastated the people, and in <placeName>Shin</placeName>
the building of the splendid halls of <placeName>A-ho</placeName> threw the country into
disorder, while how different was the case of <persName>Tai-so</persName> of <placeName>To</placeName>, who
built his palace of <placeName>Rinsan</placeName> of undressed logs and roofed it with a
thatch of untrimmed reeds, who used no decorated boats or
chariots, and spent no wealth on gorgeous dresses, fearing there-

by to impoverish his subjects, so that he made no royal
processions, and the pine-shoots grew on the tiles of his roof and the
ivy clustered thickly on the walls of his palace.

<head>MOON-VIEWING.</head>
<p>The ninth day of the sixth month was fixed for the
commencement of the new <placeName>Palace</placeName>, the tenth day of the eighth month
for the celebration of the raising of the roof-beams and the
thirteeth day of the eleventh month for the Imperial Entry.
</p>
<p>
The <placeName>Ancient Capital</placeName> was now falling into ruin, but the new one
was full of life and bustle, Thus sadly did the summer pass
and the autumn had already come on. When the autumn was
almost half over, those who were in the new capital of <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>
went out to the places famous for moon-viewing. Some went
along the shore from <placeName>Suma</placeName> to <placeName>Akashi</placeName>, recalling the ancient
memories of the romance of <persName>Prince Genji</persName>, and some crossed over
the strait to the <placeName>Isle of Awaji</placeName> to gaze at the moon at <placeName>Ejima-
ga-iso</placeName>. Others made their way to <placeName>Shiraura</placeName>, <placeName>Fukiage</placeName>, <placeName>Waka-no-Ura</placeName>, <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName>, <placeName>Naniwa</placeName>, <placeName>Takasago</placeName>, or <placeName>Onoue</placeName> and stayed to
view the moon at dawn before returning. Those who had
stayed behind in the <placeName>Ancient Capital</placeName> went to <placeName>Hirosawa</placeName> at <placeName>Fushimi</placeName>
for moon-viewing.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Tokudaiji-no-Sadaisho Sanesada-no-Kyo</persName>, being greatly
devoted to the moonlight scenery of the <placeName>Ancient Capital</placeName>, after the
terth day of the eighth month went up thither from <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>.
Ah! how changed did he find everything. Before the front gates
of the few remaining houses the grass had grown thickly, and in
the dew-laden courts was a tall undergrowth of mugwort and
rushes, while the chirp of the insects shrilled everywhere, and
the chrysanthemum and purple orchid grew wild as in the plains.
Only the <placeName>Omiya Palace</placeName> at <placeName>Konoe Kawara</placeName> still recalled the
grandeur of former days. The <persName>Sadaisho</persName> proceeded to this
<placeName>Palace</placeName> with his retainers and knocked at the outer gate.
From

within the voice of a woman called reproachfully. "Who is it
that brushes the dew from the weeds of such a neglected place?"
"It is the <persName>Sadaisho</persName> who has come up from <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>," was the
reply. "Ah, in that case, since the great gate is locked, I pray
you enter by the postern on the eastern side," she answered.
So the <persName>Taisho</persName> entered by the eastern postern. Now the occupant
of the <placeName>Palace</placeName>, the <persName>Senior Dowager Empress</persName>, Consort of <persName>Konoe
Tenno</persName>, finding time hang heavy on her hands, had opened the
lattice on the south side of her apartment and was solacing
herself by playing on the biwa, reviving the while her memories
of former days, when unexpectedly the <persName>Sadaisho</persName> entered. His
appearance greatly surprised the <orgName>Empress</orgName>, who laid aside her
biwa and exclaimed: "Ah! is it indeed reality or am I in a
dream? But pray enter." In the volume of the <title>Genji Monogatari</title> called '<placeName>Uji</placeName>' it is written how the daughter of the <persName>Lay-devotee Prince</persName>, oppressed with melancholy at the passing of
autumn, spent the night playing the biwa to calm her troubled
spirit, and becoming impatient at last for the moon of dawn to
appear, her feelings overcame her and she beckoned to it with
the plectrum of her biwa. By this we can understand something
of the <persName>Empress'</persName> feelings.
</p>
<p>
Now in this <placeName>Palace</placeName> was a waiting damsel who went by the
name of '<persName>Eve-awaiting Maid</persName>,' and the reason of this nick-name
was that once the <roleName>Empress</roleName> had asked which was the most
affecting, the awaiting a lover in the evening or the parting from him
in the morning, and the girl had replied with the verse :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Sadder the bell at eve when we wait in vain for his coming;</l>
<l>Nought is the cry of the bird, hast'ning the parting at dawn."</l>
</lg>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><placeName>Uji</placeName>. This passage occurs in the volume entitled 'Agemaki!. It is
thus referred to because the section of which it forms a part is called '<placeName>Uji</placeName>
jitcho'.</note>

<p><pb n="220" xml:id="p244-220"/>

Calling this lady, <persName>Sanesada-no-Kyo</persName> conversed with her about
many things past and present, and then he made the following song
in the Imayo style about the ruined state of the former capital;
</p>
<lg>
<l>"When we now view the capital of yore,</l>
<l>How is it wasted like a reed-grown plain;</l>
<l>Through all its chambers pours the moon's pale light,</l>
<l>The blasts of autumn pierce me to the bone."</l>
</lg>
<p>
This strain he sang three times clearly, and the <roleName>Empress</roleName> and all
her lady attendants were so moved that they buried their faces
in their sleeves and wept.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the dawn broke and the <persName>Sadaisho</persName> took leave of
them and returned to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>. On the way he called a certain
<persName>Kurando</persName> of his company and said to him: "I think that
ladyin-waiting seemed very much pained at parting, I pray you go
back and say something suitable to the occasion." So the
<persName>Kurando</persName> hurried back again at his bidding, and improvising this
stanza, recited it to her as though from his lord:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though you said it is nought, the cry of the bird at the dawning;</l>
<l>Now at this very dawn, why is your countenance sad?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
Without hesitation the lady replied:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though we are pained at the bell when at eve we grow weary of waiting;</l>
<l>Yet when at dawn he returns, hateful the cry of the bird."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Then the <persName>Kurando</persName> hastened back again and related the whole
affair to his lord, whereat the <persName>Sadaisho</persName> praised him saying that
it was well said indeed; and ever after this <persName>Kurando</persName> was known
as '<persName>Mono-ka-wa-no-kurando</persName>, after the first words of his poem.
</p>
<p>
The three couplets of the lady and the <persName>Kurando</persName> run thus:
</p>
<lg type="romaji">

<head>EVIL SPIRITS.</head>
<p>Since the <orgName>Heike</orgName> removed the capital to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, people
were much troubled by evil dreams, and many strange occurrences
took place. One night, when the <persName>Nyudo</persName> had retired to his bed,
suddenly the whole room was filled with faces innumerable,
peering at him. <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was not at all perturbed but looked
up and glared at them in return, whereupon they all faded away
and vanished. And in the <placeName>Oka Palace</placeName> which was then being
built, though there were no especially great timbers, yet one
night there was heard a crashing sound as of great timbers falling,
and then a great shout of laughter up in the air as though two or
three thousand people were all laughing at once. Verily, it was
considered, this must be the work of the <term>Tengu</term>, so a guard was
stationed, fifty men by day and a hundred by night, called the
guard of the whizzing arrows. For when they shot these
whizzing arrows toward the direction where a <term>Tengu</term> was, there
was no sound, but if it was shot at a place where there was none,
then there was a burst of laughter. Also one morning when
<persName>Kiyomori</persName> went out of his chamber and passed through the
wicket gate to view the garden, at once the garden was
filled with a heap of skulls of dead men without number that
rolled and writhed one over another, up and down and in and
out, rattling and clattering as they moved.
The <persName>Nyudo</persName> called
to his attendants, but it chanced that there was no one to answer.
Then all the skulls came together and united into one huge skull.
like a mountain in size, that seemed to fill the whole garden,
perhaps a hundred and forty or fifty feet high, and in this great
skull appeared millions of great eyes like the eyes of a man, that
glared at the <persName>Nyudo</persName> with an unwinking stare.
The <persName>Nyudo</persName> on.
his part was quite unmoved, and stood his ground glaring at
them in return for some time, when as the dew or hoar-frost
that melts in the sun, they vanished away leaving not a trace

behind. Also it happened that this <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName> had
in his stables a horse that he was especially fond of, so that he
appointed many attendants to look after it night and day, and in
one night a rat made a nest in its tail and produced young ones
therein. As this was a very strange phenomenon the Imperial
diviners were consulted about it, and they declared it to be a
portent of grave significance, Now this horse had been
presented to the <persName>Nyudo</persName> by <persName>Oba Saburo Kagechika</persName> of <placeName>Sagami</placeName>, and was
renowned as the finest horse in all the eight eastern provinces.
It was black with a small patch of white on its forehead and was
named <persName>Mochizuki</persName>. It was afterward given to <persName>Abe-no-Yasu-
chika</persName>, Chief of the Diviners. Now in former times, in the days
of <persName>Tenchi Tenno</persName>, a rat made its nest and brought forth young
in the tail of a horse of the Imperial Stables, and thereupon
there followed an insurrection of bandits in <placeName>Korea</placeName>. It is
recorded in the <title>Nihon Shoki</title>.' It happened also that a young
retainer of <persName>Gen Chunagon Masayori-no-Kyo</persName> had a very ominous
dream. He dreamed that he was in the Imperial Department of
Rites in the Palace and that a number of Lady Officials of the
Court, clad in the stately robes of ancient ceremony, had
assembled there as for a council. She who sat in the lowest seat, and
who seemed to be a supporter of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, was driven out of
the assembly, while an old man of dignified bearing, who sat in
the highest place, declared that the <term>Sword of Commission</term> that
was deposited with the <orgName>Heike</orgName> should be returned and given to
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-suke</persName>, now in exile in the
province of <placeName>Izu</placeName>; upon which another elder who sat by his side
demanded that afterwards it should be given to his grandson. On
the young samurai asking in his dream what was the meaning of
this, yet another old man told him that the Lady Official who
sat in the lowest place and was a partizan of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> was
<persName>Itsukushima Daimyojin</persName>, while he who said that the Sword

should be given to <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was <persName>Hachiman Daibosatsu</persName>, and
the other who wished it given to his grandson was <persName>Kasuga
Daimyojin</persName>, at the same time informing him that he himself was
<persName>Takeuchi Myojin</persName>. When he awoke, the young man told this
dream to someone, so that it came to pass that the <persName>Nyudo</persName> heard
of it, whereupon he immediately sent a messenger to <persName>Masayori-no-Kyo</persName> bidding him send the young samurai who had had this
dream that he might question him further about it. The young
samurai, fearing some evil consequences, ran away, and <persName>Masayori</persName>
himself went to the mansion of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and denied the whole
story; after which no more was heard about it. It was a
remarkable thing too that the silver mounted halberd that had been
given to the <persName>Nyudo</persName> in a divine dream by <persName>Itsukushima Daimyojin</persName>
after he had worshipped at her shrine when he was <persName>Aki-no-kami</persName>,
suddenly disappeared one night in a strange manner. How sad
it was that though the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had guarded the Imperial House
and protected the Empire up till now, they should disobey the
Imperial Order and be deprived of their <term>Sword of Commission</term>.

<head>OBA RIDES HARD TO FUKUHARA.</head>
<p>Now when the <persName>Saisho Nyudo Seirai</persName> heard these things in
his retirement at <placeName>Koya</placeName>, he exclaimed: "Truly the end of the
supremacy of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> draws nigh. That <persName>Itsukushima Dai-
myojin</persName> should favour the <orgName>Heike</orgName> is quite natural, and as that
deity is the third daughter of the <persName>Dragon King Shakatsura</persName>, she
will be a female deity; moreover it is also not without reason
that <persName>Hachiman Daibosatsu</persName> should speak of giving the <term>Sword
of Commission</term> to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, but I do not at all understand why

and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> have succeeded to their power the Courtier Minis-

Then a certain priest who was with him answered: "Verily
the Glorious Deities deign to put away their effulgence
and descend to earth to become incarnate in divers manners, at
times appearing as female deities and sometimes again as ordinary
mortals, and seeing that this <persName>Itsukushima Daimyojin</persName> indeed
possesses the <term>Three Enlightenments</term> and the <term>Six Supernatural

though a man may weary of this fleeting world and enter the
True Path, and devote himself with a single mind to the Future

hears of good government he will rejoice, and when he learns of
trouble he will be moved. This is indeed the way of all men.

Now on the second day of the ninth month it came to pass
that <persName>Oba Kagechika</persName> of <placeName>Sagami</placeName> rode hard to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> with
these tidings: "On the seventeenth day of the eighth month the
former <persName>Uhyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> who was exiled to <placeName>Izu</placeName>, in
league with his father-in-law <persName>Hojo no Jiro Tokimasa</persName>, attacked
the residence of the deputy governor of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, <persName>Izumi-no-Hangwan
Kanetaka</persName>, by night and slew him, after which with some three
hundred horsemen under <persName>Doi</persName>, <persName>Tsuchiya</persName>, <persName>Okazaki</persName> and others,
he retired on the defensive to <placeName>Ishibashiyama</placeName>. I then, having
got together about a thousand horsemen of our partizans, at

once pressed on and attacked them and drove them headlong,
so that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> after making a desperate stand with seven or
eight horsemen who were left, fled to <placeName>Sugiyama</placeName> of <placeName>Doi</placeName> for
refuge. Then <persName>Hatakeyama</persName> on our side gathered together some
five hundred horsemen and attacked <persName>Miura Osuke</persName> of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
who mustered about three hundred. The fight took place on
the shore of <placeName>Kotsubo</placeName> at <placeName>Yui</placeName>, and <persName>Hatakeyama</persName> was defeated and
retired to the province of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>. After this <persName>Hatakeyama</persName>
gathered his whole clan with <persName>Kowagoe</persName>, <persName>Inake</persName>, <persName>Koyamada</persName>, <persName>Edo</persName>

of his force taking boats at <placeName>Kuri-ga-hama</placeName> and fleeing to <placeName>Awa</placeName>
and <placeName>Kazusa</placeName>."

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>ENEMIES OF THE MIKADO.</head>
<p>Thus were the <orgName>Heike</orgName> soon rudely awakened from their
pleasant diversion of removing the capital. The younger among
the <roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName> exclaimed with apprehension: "Ah!
it seems that some crisis is at hand, let us then prepare to fight
at once." Now at this time <persName>Hatakeyama Shoji Shigeyoshi</persName>,
<persName>Koyamada no Betto Arishige</persName> and <persName>Utsu-no-miya no Saemon
Tomotsuna</persName> were in the capital taking their turn as Imperial
Guard, and <persName>Hatakeyama</persName> said: "We all know that <persName>Hojo</persName> is
friendly with <persName>Yoritomo</persName> and likely to plot with him, but it is
difficult to think that the others have thus opposed the Throne."
Whereat many others agreed with him, though there were others
who dissented, murmuring: "No, no, a great crisis is upon us."
The <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName> on his part flew into a great rage:
"This <persName>Yoritomo</persName>," he exclaimed, "ought to have been executed
when his father <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> rebelled in the twelfth month of the
first year of Heiji, but the urgent entreaties of the late <persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName> prevailed and he was sent into exile. Now he is so far
<pb n="226" xml:id="p250-226"/>

wanting in any gratitude as to draw his bow against our house.
How can the gods and the Three Sacred Things pardon such
iniquity? Surely he will suffer the punishment of heaven."
</p>
<p>
Now the first example of an opponent of the Throne was in
the fourth year of the reign of <persName>Iware-Hiko-no-Mikoto</persName> (<persName>Jimmu
Tenno</persName>), when in <placeName>Takao</placeName> village in the district of <placeName>Nagusa</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Kishu</placeName> there was a certain spider, long of legs and
short of body, whose strength was greater than that of the
strongest man, that wrought great damage to the people. The
Imperial Army went forth to meet it, and when they had read the
Imperial Decree, made ainet of wild vines with which they caught
it and killed it. Since that time the following persons have
attempted treacherously to overthrow the Imperial Authority.
<persName>Oishi no Yamarnaru</persName>, <persName>Prince Oyama</persName>, <persName>Yamada no Ishikawa</persName>, the
<persName>Minister Moriya</persName>, <persName>Soga no Iruka</persName>, <persName>Otomo no Matori</persName>, <persName>Bunya no
Miyada</persName>, <persName>Tachibana no Hayanari</persName>, <persName>Hikami no Kawatsugi</persName>, the
<persName>Imperial Prince Iyo</persName>, <persName>Dazai no Shoni</persName>, <persName>Fujiwara no Hirotsugu</persName>,
<persName>Emi no Oshikatsu</persName>, <persName>Prince Sahara</persName>, <persName>Igami no Hirokimi</persName>, <persName>Fujiwara
no Nakanari</persName>, <persName>Taira no Masakado</persName>, <persName>Fujiwara no Sumitomo</persName>, <persName>Abe
no Sadato</persName>, <persName>Muneto</persName>, the former <persName>Tsushima-no-kami Minamoto no
Yoshichika</persName>, <persName>Akusafu</persName>, and <persName>Akuemon-no-kami</persName>, more than twenty
in all, and of all these there was not one that attained his desire,
but all of them left their carcasses to bleach on the mountain or
plain, while their heads were exposed on the public scaffold. In
the present generation the Throne is held in light esteem, but in
former days when the Imperial Decree was read withered herbs
and trees would straightway put forth flowers and fruit, and the
birds of the air would obey. Not so very long ago, when the
<persName>Mikado</persName> of the <term>Engi</term> era (<persName>Daigo Tenno</persName>), was proceeding to
<placeName>Shinzen-en</placeName>, a heron was seen by the brink of a pond, and the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> ordered an attendant of the sixth rank to catch it.
The Courtier wondered how he was to do so, but as it was the
Imperial Mandate, he went towards it, when the heron at once
prepared to fly away. 'The <persName>Mikado</persName> Commands" cried the
Courtier," whereupon the bird crouched down and did not
<pb n="227" xml:id="p251-227"/>

move, so that he caught it and brought it to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>.
"How admirable indeed," said His Majesty, "that this heron
should thus obey the Imperial Behest; let the fifth rank he
hereby conferred upon it." Moreover the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> with his
own hand bound round its neck a tablet declaring that from
that day it should be promoted to be the King of the herons,
after which it was set free. This heron was not intended to be
taken to make sport for His Majesty, but to show the power of
the Imperial Authority.

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>THE PALACE OF KAN-YO.</head>
<p>To quote a foreign precedent. <persName>Tan</persName>, Crown Prince of <placeName>En</placeName>,
was taken captive by the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName> and kept imprisoned
for twelve years.
Then, weeping, he petitioned the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
saying: "I have an old mother in my native land and I long
to see her once more; grant me I pray you permission to
return." But the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> only derided him saying: "If
horns grow on a horse and a crow be found with a white head,
then I will allow you to return." Then <persName>Tan</persName>, prostrating himself
on the ground and looking up to heaven, prayed earnestly that
these things might be caused to happen, that he might return to
his country and see his mother once again. Now <persName>Myo-on
Bosatsu</persName> went to <placeName>Ryosen</placeName> in <placeName>India</placeName> to punish the unfilial, and
<persName>Koshi</persName> and <persName>Genkai</persName> in <placeName>China</placeName> first taught the people filial piety.
So the Three Treasures of the Hidden and Revealed felt
compassion for his filial desire, and there came a horse with horns
to the Palace, and a crow with a white head appeared sitting on
a tree in the Imperial Garden. The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was greatly
astonished at such an extraordinary thing and, out of respect for his

Royal Word, he remitted the imprisonment of <persName>Tan</persName> and sent him
back to his native country.
</p>
<p>
But afterwards he repented of his generosity. Now be
tween the countries of <placeName>En</placeName> and <placeName>Shin</placeName> there was another country
called <placeName>So</placeName>, and on its boundary ran a great river over which
there was a bridge called the <placeName>bridge of So</placeName>; and The <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
sent his troops to this bridge to cause him to fall into the river
when he should have crossed to the middle of it. But though
he fell into the midst of the river, he was so fortunate as not to
drown, but going as though on dry land he safely reached the
farther bank. Wondering how this could be, he looked back
and perceived that innumerable turtles were floating on the
water, and that they had ranged themselves in a line on the
surface so that he had been able to cross over on their backs.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Tan</persName>, filled with resentment, would not submit to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
so he sent his army to destroy him. <persName>Tan</persName>, greatly alarmed, sent
for a certain warrior named <persName>Kei-ka</persName> and made him Prime Minister,
whereupon <persName>Kei-ka</persName> in turn summoned another soldier called
<persName>Den-ko</persName> to his aid. Then <persName>Denko</persName> said: "Did you send for me
to assist you thinking I was young and strong?
A <persName>Kirin</persName> may
spring a thousand miles it is said, but when he is old he is worse
than a bad horse; so how can I, now that I am old, be of any
use to you? It will be better to find a more vigorous soldier
than I am." 'Ah,” replied <persName>Kei-ka</persName>," do not tell anyone of this
affair." "If this thing becomes known," answered <persName>Denko</persName>, "I
shall lose my reputation in future, and there is no shame worse
than that one lose his good name.'
So saying he dashed his
head against the plum tree that stood by the gate and died.

<p>
Now there was another warrior named <persName>Han-yo-ki</persName>, and he
was a subject of <placeName>Shin</placeName>, but as his parents and relations had been
put to death by the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, he fled to <placeName>En</placeName>. Then the <persName>Em-
peror</persName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName> sent a proclamation through the four seas saying:
<pb n="229" xml:id="p253-229"/>

Whoever shall bring me a map of <placeName>En</placeName> and the head of <persName>Han-yo-ki</persName>
shall receive five hundred pounds weight of gold," Then <persName>Kei-
ka</persName> went to <persName>Han-yo-ki</persName> and said: "I hear that anyone who
takes your head to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName> will receive five
hundred pounds of gold; if then you will give me your head
that I may take it to him, he will certainly divert himself by
looking at it. At that time it will not be difficult for me to draw
a sword and stab him to death." When <persName>Han-yo-ki</persName> heard this
proposal he was greatly amazed and then drew a sigh of
gladness. "The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> has slain my parents, my uncles and my
brethren," he exclaimed, “and I brood over it day and night,
for an unbearable resentment has pierced me to the bone; if
therefore you will kill him indeed, most willingly I give you my
head." And he cut off his head and died,
</p>
<p>
Now there was another soldier named <persName>Shin-bu-yo</persName> who had
fled to the land of <placeName>En</placeName> when he was but a boy of thirteen, after
having taken revenge on his enemy; he was a matchless warrior
whom little children would embrace when he smiled, while
grown men would faint at his angry frown. This man <persName>Kei-ka</persName>
took with him as a guide to the capital of <placeName>Shin</placeName> and they both
set out. One night as they were stopping at a certain
mountainvillage they heard the sound of music coming from another
hamlet near by, and made divination from the tune that was being
played in order to determine whether their enterprise would be
successful. "The enemy is water and we are fire. The
rainbow cannot pierce the sun. Our aim will be difficult to carry
out," was the oracle. However, as it was not convenient to
return now, they went on and in due time arrived at <placeName>Kan-yo-kyu</placeName>
the capital of <placeName>Shin</placeName>, and announced that they had brought to the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> the map of <placeName>En</placeName> and the head of <persName>Han-yo-ki</persName>. The
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> sent an envoy to receive their presents, but, as they
refused to deliver them up except to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> himself, he
bade that they should be summoned to be received in audience
by the Court. Now the circumference of the city of <placeName>Kan-yo-
kyu</placeName> was eighteen thousand three hundred and eighty miles, and
<pb n="230" xml:id="p254-230"/>

the Palace was built up three miles above the level plain. Here
was the <placeName>Hall of Longevity</placeName> and the <placeName>Gate of Eternal Youth</placeName>: a
sun wrought of pure gold adorned it, and a moon of silver, and
it was strewn with sand of pearls, rubies, and gold. It was en
closed on all sides by a wall of iron four hundred feet high, and
over the Palace was stretched a net of iron to keep away all evil
demons from the under-world; and as this wall obstructed the
wild geese in their flight in spring and autumn, an iron gate
called the <placeName>Wild Goose Gate</placeName> was made in it for them to pass
through. Within it was the Palace called the <placeName>Aho-den</placeName> where
the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was wont to proceed to give audience for the
affairs of state: it was nine cho in length from east to west and
five cho from south to north, its height being three hundred and
sixty feet, while banners fifty feet in height could easily stand
under its floor. It was roofed with tiles of emerald and shone
with gold and silver below. When the two, <persName>Kei-ka</persName> carrying the
map of <placeName>En</placeName> and <persName>Shin-bu-yo</persName> the head of <persName>Han-yo-ki</persName>, had half
ascended the jewelled staircase, <persName>Shin-bu-yo</persName>, overcome by the
immensity and splendour of the Palace, was seized with a fit of
trembling. The retainers, seeing this, said : "Common people
must not approach our Lord; the superior man does not ap
proach the common herd, if he does so he risks his life."
<persName>Kei-ka</persName> turned and replied: "<persName>Bu-yo</persName> has no treacherous intent,
but he is a rustic only accustomed to the ways of the country,
and has no experience of a Court like this, so he is naturally
embarrassed." Thus the retainers were pacified, and they were
permitted to enter the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> presence and exhibit to him
the map and the head. Now as the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was looking at the
head, he caught sight of a gleaming knife at the bottom of the
box in which it was presented, and immediately started back, but
as he did so <persName>Kei-ka</persName> seized his sleeve and struck at his breast
with the knife. At this time, though the Palace was crowded
with scores of thousands of armed retainers, not one of them
dared to lift a hand to help their master; they only deplored the
crime of such a treacherous subject. But the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> entreated
</p>
<p><pb n="231" xml:id="p255-231"/>

<persName>Kei-ka</persName> saying; “I pray you allow me a short respite, for I
desire greatly to hear the <roleName>Empress</roleName> play on the Koto once
more; " to which request <persName>Kei-ka</persName> assented. Now the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
had three thousand consorts, among whom the lady <persName>Kwa-yo</persName>
was an unrivalled player on the Koto, so that the wrath of the
fiercest warrior was calmed when he heard her, and the birds
would descend from the air, and the trees and flowers move in
harmony with her music, and now that in tears she played to
her Lord for the last time none could resist the spell of her
melody. <persName>Kei-ka</persName> bowed his head and listened, and for a while
his fierce and revengeful mood relaxed. Then the lady <persName>Kwa-yo</persName>
began a second piece and the words that she sung were these:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though a seven-foot screen may be high,</l>
<l>Is it not possible to leap over it?</l>
<l>Though a length of silk gauze may be strong,</l>
<l>If you jerk it will it not tear?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
These words passed unnoticed by <persName>Kei-ka</persName>, but the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
heard and understood, and suddenly tearing his sleeve, he leaped
over the seven-foot screen that stood near and ran and took
refuge behind a copper pillar. Then <persName>Kei-ka</persName> sprang up fiercely
and hurled the dagger at him, but the <persName>Emperor's Physician-in-
Waiting</persName> immediately threw his medicine bag so that it caught
the dagger, which struck and pierced half through the six-foot
copper pillar. <persName>Kei-ka</persName> had no other weapon, so he could do no
more, and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> returning to his place took his own
sword and cut him to pieces, <persName>Shin-bu-yo</persName> being put to death also.
Then the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> gathered his army and marched against <persName>Tan</persName>
of <placeName>En</placeName>. Thus if the blue sky does not permit, the rainbow
cannot pierce through the sun; the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> escaped and <persName>Tan</persName> was
destroyed at the last. <persName>Yoritomo</persName> will also come to an end in like
manner, said those who wished to flatter the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.

the third month of the first year of Eiryaku only through
the urgent pleading of the late <persName>Ike-no-zenni</persName>, when his father
<persName>Sama-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName> was executed in the twelfth month of
the first
year of Heiji for the rebellion that he made. He was at
that time fourteen years of age, and having spent some twenty
autumns in exile was now of mature years; and if one should
wonder why he stirred up a revolt in this year, it was because of
the exhortation of <persName>Mongaku Shonin</persName> of <placeName>Takao</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
This <persName>Mongaku</persName> was formerly known as <persName>Endo Musha
Morito</persName> and was the son of <persName>Watanabe no Endo Sakon-no-Shogen
Mochito</persName>, having been a retainer of <persName>Josei-mon-in</persName>, a consort of
<persName>Toba-in</persName>, but at the age of nineteen, possessed by a desire to enter
the Way of Buddha, he shaved his head and started to practise
mortification of the flesh. With the intention of proving how much
he could endure, he stripped himself naked and lay down on his
back in a bamboo thicket in the depth of the mountains under
the scorching sun during the hottest days of the sixth month,
when there was no breath of wind, and the horse-flies and
mosquitoes and wild bees and ants and every kind of poisonous
insect came and settled on his body and bit and stung him, but
in spite of this he did not move a muscle. Thus he remained
for the space of seven days, but on the eighth day he arose and
asked whether religious asceticism demanded as much as this or
not. "If it was so severe was the reply," how could people
survive it?" Thus reassured, he began his austere life by going
to: <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, intending to live in retirement at <placeName>Nachi</placeName>. Now at
<placeName>Nachi</placeName> is a famous water-fall, and <persName>Mongaku</persName> determined to bathe
in it as a religious exercise. It was past the tenth day of the
twelfth month when he arrived there and the snow had fallen
thickly; the river that ran through the valley was silent in its
icy shroud; the freezing blasts blew fiercely from the
mountaintops and the water-fall was a mass of crystal icicles, while the

twigs were everywhere hidden under their heavy coat of snow.
<persName>Mongaku</persName>, invoking the magic power of <persName>Fudo Myo-o</persName>, immersed
himself up to the neck in the pool of the water-fall and remained
thus two, three, then four days, but on the fifth, unable to endure
any longer, losing his senses he was washed away by the mighty
volume of the falling water, and carried some six or seven
hundred yards down stream, his body dashing against the sharp
edged rocks as it rose and fell in the swirling current. Then
suddenly there appeared a beautiful boy who seized his hand
and drew him safely up on to the bank. The bystanders, seeing
his dangerous plight, soon kindled a fire and warmed him so
that he recovered consciousness, for it was not his fate to perish,
but as soon as he again drew his breath and opened his eyes, he
glared about him in great anger, crying out with a loud voice:
"I am under a vow to stand under the water-fall for thrice
seven days and repeat the magic invocation of <persName>Fudo</persName> three
hundred thousand times, and to-day being only the fifth day,
who has dared to pull me out?" On hearing these words the
hair of their heads stood up and they could say nothing. Then
he plunged again into the water-fall and stood as before for two
days, and on the second day eight boys appeared and grasped
both his hands to draw him from the water, but he resisted
them strongly and would not move. On the third day he again
became as one dead, whereupon, that the water-fall should not
be polluted, two heavenly youths, with their hair bound up
tightly, descended from above the fall, and rubbed the whole
body of <persName>Mongaku</persName> from head to foot with their warm and
perfumed hands, so that he breathed again as one in a dream, and
asked who it might be that thus had compassion on him. "We
are <persName>Kongara</persName> and <persName>Seitaka</persName>, the messengers of <persName>Fudo Myo-o</persName>,"

replied the two youths, and we have come in obedience to the
command of the <persName>Myo-o</persName>, "<persName>Mongaku</persName> has made a sublime vow and
is now undergoing unparalleled austerities; go ye and succour
him." Then <persName>Mongaku</persName> cried with a loud voice; "Where is
the abode of the <persName>Myo-o</persName>?" "His abode is in the <placeName>Tosotten</placeName>, the
fourth Heaven of Desire," they replied as they ascended far aloft
above the clouds. <persName>Mongaku</persName> clasped his hands and exclaimed
fervently: "Now am I full of hope, for even <persName>Fudo Myo-o</persName>
knows of my austerities ;" and he again took up his position in
the water-fall. But from henceforth he was favoured by most
gracious signs of divine assistance; the bitter wind no longer
pierced his body, and the falling water felt warm and soothing,
and so he completed the three weeks of his vow and afterwards
spent a thousand days in retirement at <placeName>Nachi</placeName>. Then he started
to travel round the whole country as a pilgrim, ascending <placeName>Omine</placeName>
three times, <placeName>Katsuragi</placeName> twice, and then proceeding to <placeName>Koya</placeName>,
<placeName>Kogawa</placeName>, <placeName>Kinbusen</placeName>, <placeName>Hakusan</placeName>, <placeName>Tateyama</placeName>, the peak of <placeName>Fuji</placeName>, <placeName>Izu</placeName>,
<placeName>Hakone</placeName>, <placeName>Togakushi</placeName> in <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, and <placeName>Haguro</placeName> in <placeName>Dewa</placeName>, until at
last, feeling a longing for his native province, he returned to the
<placeName>Capital</placeName>, hardened like a well-tempered blade by his privations,
and wise enough to pray down a flying bird from the sky.

despoiled it of tiles, and the altar of <persName>Buddha</persName> stood bare to the

moon shone betimes into it. <persName>Mongaku</persName>, having made a vow to
rebuild this temple, drew up a roll for donations and went round
in all quarters to seek supporters, and in the course of his
wanderings he came to the <placeName>Hojuji-den</placeName> where the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was residing,
and requested His Majesty to make a contribution. But it
chanced that the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was at the time engaged in some
amusement and paid no attention, so <persName>Mongaku</persName>, who was naturally a
bold and uncompromising character, knowing nothing of the
<persName>Ho-o's</persName> disinclination, but only thinking that the attendants had
not told him, forced his way through into the Imperial: Garden
and shouted out loudly:"Oh most merciful Lord, how can it
be that you pay no heed to such a matter as this? And
forthwith he spread out the roll of Kwanjincho and lifting it up high

I, <persName>Mongaku</persName>, though I have put away the dust of this world and

<p>Now it happened that at this time the <persName>Dajō-daijin Myo-on-

Sukekata-no-Kyo</persName> was playing the six-stringed Koto, and his son
<persName>Uma-no-kami Suketoki</persName> was singing and dancing the Saibara,
<persName>Morisada</persName>, an attendant of the Fourth Rank, keeping time
meanwhile and singing various Imayo measures, so that the Palace
resounded with musical strains and they were all very merry.
The <persName>Ho-o</persName> himself had deigned to join in the singing also, when
suddenly the loud and strident voice of <persName>Mongaku</persName> broke in on
their melody, spoiling the harmony and entirely upsetting the
rhythm. "What is this?" exclaimed the <persName>Ho-o</persName> in great wrath,
"who is this boor who dares to interrupt Our Imperial Pleasure?
Strike him down, someone! At this the young and impetuous
among the samurai in attendance rushed forward, each trying to
be foremost, headed by one, <persName>Sukeyuki Hangwan</persName> by name, who
<pb n="228" xml:id="p262-238"/>

shouted out, "Down with this villain who dares to disturb His
Majesty's Amusement.” "I don't move from here until I
receive the grant of a manor towards the cost of my temple on
Mount <placeName>Takao</placeName>," replied <persName>Mongaku</persName> calmly, and then as he saw
that they meant to attack him, shifting the Kanjincho to his other
hand, he gave <persName>Sukeyuki Hangwan</persName> a blow on the head that
knocked off his eboshi, and then doubling his fist struck him
another in the chest that sent him flying backwards, so that he
took to his heels and fled into the interior of the Palace. He
then drew from his bosom a dirk with the hilt wound with the
hair of a horse's tail, and baring the blade stood waiting, ready
to strike down any who approached. As he sprang round in all
directions with the Kanjincho in his left hand and the blade
gleaming like ice in his right, it looked as if he had a sword in
each hand. <roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName>, terrified at such an amazing
scene, ran about in all directions, so that the party of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>
was quite broken up and the whole Palace was in an uproar.
Then one of the <persName>Palace Guard</persName>, <persName>Ando Musha Migimune</persName> by
name, drew his sword and rushed upon <persName>Mongaku</persName>, who also
sprang forward to meet him. <persName>Ando Musha</persName>, not wishing to
shed blood, turned the edge of his weapon and struck him a
heavy blow with the back on his sword-arm, and then, as he
staggered back a little, dropping his sword sprang on him with a
shout to grapple with him. <persName>Mongaku</persName>, falling undermost, gripped
his opponent's right arm as he did so and held on tight, but in
spite of this <persName>Ando</persName> managed to seize him by the throat, and so,
being about equal in strength, they rolled about in their struggles,
now one being uppermost and now the other, until the others,
who had held back so far, summoned up courage to rush in and
overpower <persName>Mongaku</persName> and bind him, after which he was dragged
out and handed over to the underlings of the <placeName>Kebiishi-cho</placeName>. As
they were taking him away, he drew himself up and glared at
the Palace, crying out in a loud voice, the while he pranced up
and down with anger: "So! not only do I get nothing,
but I am treated in this outrageous manner. Know that
<pb n="239" xml:id="p263-239"/>

the <term>Three Worlds</term> are to be consumed by fire, and how
shall even the Palace of the Sovereign escape this fate? Even if
one is an Emperor who boasts of the <term>Ten Virtues</term>, will he not
descend to the <placeName>Yellow Springs of Death</placeName> and be tormented by
the <persName>Ox-headed</persName> and <persName>Horse-headed Jailers of Hell</persName>?" Then the
order was given to put this insolent priest into prison and he was
led off to be confined. <persName>Sukeyuki Hangwan</persName>, covered with shame
at the ignominy of having his eboshi knocked off, did not
appear at Court for a long time. <persName>Ando Musha</persName>, however, was
rewarded for boldly seizing <persName>Mongaku</persName> by being at once promoted
to the position of Uma-no-jo over the heads of others senior to
him.
</p>
<p>
About this time it happened that <persName>Bifuku-mon-in</persName> died and
there was a general amnesty so that <persName>Mongaku</persName> was set free, but
as soon as he was let out he set forth again with his Kanjincho
to collect contributions everywhere; and not only so, but
wherever he went he proclaimed that the age was corrupt and that
both the Emperor and his subjects would be destroyed, with the
result that, as such disrespectful words could not be permitted,
he was not allowed to remain in the <placeName>Capital</placeName> but banished to <placeName>Izu</placeName>.
Now <persName>Izu-no-Kami Nakatsuna</persName>, the eldest son of <persName>Gensammi Nyudo</persName>,
was at this time Governor of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, and when this sentence was
pronounced he gave orders that <persName>Mongaku</persName> should be brought to
<placeName>Izu</placeName> by ship from the <placeName>Tokaido</placeName>, or <placeName>Eastern Coast</placeName>, and sent two
or three inferior officials of the Kebiishi to take charge of him.
These officers then said to him: "It is the custom for minor
officials like ourselves to profit somewhat on these occasions; no
doubt your reverence has many friends in various places, so
when you are sent into exile to a far province, they will certainly
wish to give you some presents, and food and necessaries for the
journey; will you not then communicate with them?" "I
have few friends of that sort," replied <persName>Mongaku</persName> with a laugh,
"but there is someone who lives on <placeName>Higashi-yama</placeName> who might
perhaps do something for me; I will write a letter." Then they
produced some very cheap paper, whereat <persName>Mongaku</persName> became
<pb n="240" xml:id="p264-240"/>

very angry, exclaiming: "How do you expect me to write on
paper like this; " and he threw it back at them. Then they go
some good thick paper and handed it to him, but <persName>Mongaku</persName>
laughed and said: "Unfortunately I cannot write, so please write
the letter for me." So one of them wrote at his dictation as
follows: "I, <persName>Mongaku</persName>, having the intention of building a temple
on Mount <placeName>Takao</placeName>, have been travelling about the country to raise
money by subscription, but the age being such an one as it is, it has
pleased the Emperor not only to refuse me any assistance, but
even to banish me to the distant province of <placeName>Izu</placeName>. This being so
I am much in need of supplies and comforts for the long journey,
and beg that you will assist me in the matter." When he had
written it, he asked to whom he should address it. "To <persName>Kwan-
non</persName> at <placeName>Kiyomizu</placeName>," replied <persName>Mongaku</persName>. "Do you then make
fools of minor officials like us?" they asked indignantly.
"By
no means," replied <persName>Mongaku</persName>, "I always rely on <persName>Kwannon</persName> of
<placeName>Kiyomizu</placeName> in need, and indeed now I have no one else on whom
to rely."
</p>
<p>
Then they took ship from the port of <placeName>Ano</placeName> in <placeName>Ise</placeName>, and when
they came to <placeName>Tenryu-nada</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Totomi</placeName> a great
tempest rose, and the ship seemed likely to be overturned by the
mountainous waves. The helmsman and the sailors gave up all
hope, and thinking their last hour had come, fell to praying,
some calling on <persName>Kwannon</persName> and others repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term> of
the dying. <persName>Mongaku</persName>, however, was all this time lying asleep in
the bottom of the ship, snoring loudly, until aroused by the
confusion he suddenly sprang up, went to the side of the ship, and
glaring angrily at the waves, shouted; "Ho! Thou <persName>Dragon King
of the Waters</persName>! What meanest thou by endangering the ship in
which is so holy a sage bound to accomplish a a great vow,
Knowest thou not, O most worthless of <persName>Dragon-Gods</persName>, that such
conduct will receive the punishment of Heaven?" Then the
wind and the waves were suddenly stilled and they arrived
safely at the shores of <placeName>Izu</placeName>. Since leaving <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> <persName>Mongaku</persName> had
always kept vividly in his mind the hope of returning to build
</p>
<p><pb n="241" xml:id="p265-241"/>

his temple on Mount <placeName>Takao</placeName>, and prayed fervently that he might
not die until he had carried out this vow, but if it was impossible
that it should be fulfilled, then he would die on the way to exile.
With this intention he fasted all the way to <placeName>Izu</placeName>, a period of
thirty-one days, for as the wind was not always favourable they
had to touch at many havens and islands, but yet in spite of this,
his natural vigour did not fail as he continued his meditations at
the bottom of the ship. Verily there were many reasons for
thinking he was no ordinary person.

buried in the eighth month of last year. Now among the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
and <persName>Heike</persName> there is no leader as distinguished as yourself, so now
quickly raise a revolt and subjugate the country!" But <persName>Yori-
tomo</persName> answered: "That is not my wish; as you know,
I was
succoured by the late <persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName>, and to shew my gratitude I
read through one part of the Hokke-Kyo every day on her
behalf. That is all I can do." "He who will not accept the
gifts of Heaven," continued <persName>Mongaku</persName>, "will be considered
blameworthy, and he who does not act when the time arrives,
will be overtaken by misfortune, as it is written. That you may
not think I speak thus only to tempt you, see by this how deep
has been my regard for your house." And he drew from his
bosom a bundle wrapped in white linen from which he took a
skull. "This is the skull of your honoured father, the late
<pb n="242" xml:id="p266-242"/>

<persName>Sama-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName>. After Heiji it was buried in front
of his prison house and there was no one to say the prayers for
him, so I begged his head from the warders, and hanging it
round my neck, went round from temple to temple praying for
his happy rebirth, and no doubt he is long since delivered from
all evil. Thus you see that I have been a most loyal servant of
your father." <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was not quite assured of the truth of
all this, but anyhow, when he was told that it was his father's
skull, he was moved to tears. After a while he restrained his
tears and said; "How can I raise a revolt unless I receive the
Imperial Pardon?" "That is easy to arrange," said <persName>Mongaku</persName>,
"for I will go up and get it for you." <persName>Yoritomo</persName> smiled
sarcastically. "Why you yourself are under the Imperial displeasure;
how then do you talk of helping others? Even for such a wise
priest it will not be easy." At this <persName>Mongaku</persName> flew into a rage
and answered: "If it were my own pardon it might be so, but
as it is for you, where is the difficulty? From here to the new
capital of <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> is not more than three days journey, and
I shall have to spend a day there to get the Imperial Edict, so
that the whole matter will not take me more than seven or eight
days." So saying he took his departure.
</p>
<p>
Returning to <placeName>Nagoya</placeName> he told his disciples that he was
going on a week's pilgrimage in the mountains of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, and set out.
Sure enough in three days he arrived at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, and as he
had some connexion with <persName>Uhyoye-no-kami Mitsuyoshi</persName>, he went
to him at once and said: "If I can obtain an Imperial Edict
for the pardon of the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName>, who is
now in exile in <placeName>Izu</placeName>, we can gather together the men of eight
provinces, and so overthrow the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and give peace to the
land." "Indeed," replied <persName>Mitsuyoshi</persName>, "I am now in an
awkward condition, for I have been deprived of my three offices,
and as for the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, he is closely confined, so it may be difficult
to do anything, but I will go and see." And he went and
acquainted the <persName>Ho-o</persName> with the affair secretly. His Majesty was
exceedingly pleased to hear it and granted the Edict forthwith.
<pb n="243" xml:id="p267-243"/>

Then <persName>Mongaku</persName>, greatly rejoiced, hung it round his neck, and after
three more days again arrived at <placeName>Izu</placeName>. Now <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was very
anxious about it all, and was wondering what would happen to
the reckless priest as the result of his rashness, when at the hour
of the Horse on the eighth day he presented himself with the
laconic remark; "Here is the Edict." Then <persName>Yoritomo</persName> with
great respect put on a new eboshi and a white robe, and washing
his hands and his mouth, took the Edict and raised it three times
to his forehead, after which he opened it and read as follows:
</p>
<p>
"For several years the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have set at nought Our Im-
perial Influence, and have not scrupled to govern the country
according to their will. This Realm is the Land of the Gods,
and their Virtue has descended to its Sovereigns from generation
to generation. So that, since the establishment of the Imperial
Line, for a thousand years and more, those who have dared to
oppose Our rule and endanger the Empire have all perished
without exception. Therefore with the ghostly aid of the High
Gods, and relying on this Our Imperial Edict, do thou quickly
destroy the <orgName>Heike</orgName> line, and subdue the enemies of Our House.
Thus shalt thou continue the traditions of a warrior family and
surpass the loyal service of thy ancestors, exalting thyself and all
thy house. The fourteenth day of the seventh month of the
fourth year of Jisho. Given through the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-kami
Mitsuyoshi</persName>. To the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-suke Dono</persName>."
</p>
<p>
This Edict <persName>Yoritomo</persName> put into a bag of brocade and hung it
round his neck, and kept it on his person even at the battle of
<placeName>Ishibashiyama</placeName>.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12" xml:id="v5_ch12">
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>FUJIKAWA.</head>
<p>Now when it was rumoured that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had raised the
standard of revolt, a council of Courtiers was held at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>,
and it was decided to attack him immediately, before he could
gather more of his adherents. The Commander-in-chief was
<pb n="244" xml:id="p268-244"/>

<persName>Komatsu-no-Gon-no-suke Shosho Koremori</persName>, and the second in
Command <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName>, while <persName>Kazusa-no-kami
Tadakiyo</persName> was Chief of the Samurai, the force numbering some
thirty thousand horsemen in all. On the eighteenth day of the
ninth month they set out from <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, and on the day after
they arrived at <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, from whence they started out on the
twentieth day to go down to the eastern provinces.
</p>
<p>
The Commander <persName>Gon-no-suke Koremori</persName> was at this time
twenty three years old, and his costume and bearing were
beautiful beyond the power of brush to depict. His general's armour,
an ancestral treasure laced with Chinese leather, was carried in
an armour-box before him, and on the road he wore a hitatare
of red brocade with a light green body armour. He rode a
dappled grey horse and his saddle was mounted in gold.
<persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadamori</persName> wore a hitatare of blue brocade and
armour laced with black, and rode a large and powerful black
horse with a saddle ornamented with powdered gold lacquer.
With their horse-trappings and armour and helmets, and even
their swords and bows flashing and glittering as they rode, they
were a splendid and martial spectacle.
</p>
<p>
This <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName> was accustomed to pay
visits to a certain lady, the daughter of a princess, and it
happened one night when he went to see her that a guest, a
distinguished lady of the Court, had chanced to come also and did
not go away until late. <persName>Tadanori</persName>, standing waiting under the
eaves of the roof, fanned himself vigorously. Hearing this the
lady in the room hummed softly to herself the line "Ah, how
loudly sounds in the field the voice of the insects;" whereat he
ceased his fanning and returned home again. Afterwards, when
he happened to go again, she asked him why it was he had
ceased fanning himself, and he answered: "Oh, it was because
I thought that you meant to imply that the noise was
troublesome to you." When this lady heard that <persName>Satsuma-no-kami</persName> was
departing for the eastern provinces she sent him a suit of silk
clothes and the following stanza, to show her grief at parting :
<pb n="245" xml:id="p269-245"/>

</p>
<lg>
<l>"Tis not the garment that brushes the dew from the grass of the Eastland,</l>
<l>But my stay-at-home sleeve, that is the wettest of all."</l>
</lg>
<p>
To which <persName>Satsuma-no-kami</persName> replied:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Surely it is not meet to show such regret at our parting,</l>
<l>Is not the road that I take that which my ancestor trod?”</l>
</lg>
<p>
Thus referring no doubt to the expedition of his ancestor
<persName>Taira Sadamori</persName>, who went down with <persName>Tawara Toda Hidesato</persName> to
subdue the rebel <persName>Masakado</persName>. Formerly, when a General went
forth to subdue an enemy of the Throne, he was received in
audience and received a Sword of Commission. The <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
used to proceed to the <placeName>Shishinden</placeName>, the <persName>Bodyguards</persName> taking up
their position at the foot of the Throne, while the <persName>Courtiers</persName> of the
Inner and Outer Council ranged themself in order as for a
Festival of the second grade. Then the <persName>Commander-in-Chief</persName>
and the <persName>Second in Command</persName>, according to the prescribed
ceremony, would approach and receive the Sword. But as it was
now difficult to follow the precedents of Shohei and Tenkyo by
reason of their antiquity, in this case they followed the procedure
of the time when <persName>Sanuki-no-kami Taira Masamori</persName> set out for the
land of <placeName>Izumo</placeName> against the former <persName>Tsushima-no-kami Minamoto
Yoshichika</persName>, and a Courtier's Bell only was given. This was put
in a leather bag and carried after the General, hung round the
neck of a retainer. In ancient times when a General went forth
from the Capital to subdue the enemies of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, there
were three things he had to forget: his family on the day when he
received the Sword of Commission; his wife and children when
he departed from the Capital; and himself when he engaged the
enemy on the field of battle. So now doubtless the two Generals
<persName>Koremori</persName> and <persName>Tadanori</persName> must have borne these three things in
mind, ill-fated as they were.
</p>
<p>
Thus leaving the Imperial Capital behind, they set forth by the
highway that goes by the eastern sea. Even returning in peace
by this road is not without danger, for the traveller must be soaked
by the dew of the open plain, and make his bed on the mossy
<pb n="246" xml:id="p270-246"/>

mountain peaks, crossing the passes and fording the rivers by the
way. So after many days, on the sixteenth day of the tenth
month they arrived at <placeName>Kiyomi-ga-saki</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName>.
When they left the Capital their forces consisted of thirty thousand
horsemen, but as other troops had joined them on the way they
now had an army of seventy thousand, of which the vanguard
reached as far as <placeName>Fujikawa</placeName> and <placeName>Kambara</placeName> while the rearguard
was yet at <placeName>Tegoshi</placeName> and <placeName>Utsunoya</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Then the Commander <persName>Gonnosuke-no-Shosho Koremori</persName>
summoned the Chief of the Samusai <persName>Kazusa-no-kami Tadakiyo</persName> and
said: "It is my opinion that we had better cross over Mt.
<placeName>Ashigara</placeName> and there give battle; what do you think?" "When
we left <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>,” replied <persName>Kazusa-no-Kami</persName>, “His Excellency
the <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName> bade that all military matters should
be entrusted to me, and though the forces of <placeName>Izu</placeName> and <placeName>Tsuruga</placeName>
ought to have joined us by now, so far none of them have come
up, and although we have an army of seventy thousand horse,
yet all our forces, both horses and men, are tired out; moreover
as all the eastern provinces have taken the side of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> to
the last man, it is impossible to say how many tens of thousands
they may muster. I think it wisest therefore to draw up our
army on this side of the <placeName>Fujikawa</placeName> with the river in front of us and
wait to see how matters turn out." And so, as there was nothing
else to be done, he consented.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Hyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> pushed on, and, after crossing
Mt. <placeName>Ashigara</placeName>, came to the <placeName>Kisegawa</placeName>, where the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of <placeName>Kai</placeName>
and <placeName>Shinano</placeName> came hurrying up to join him. At <placeName>Ukishima-ga-
hara</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName> he drew up his forces in battle
array, numbering in all some two hundred thousand horsemen,
At this time <persName>Satake Taro</persName> of the <persName>Hitachi Genji</persName> sent a letter by
one of his retainers to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, but the messenger was intercepted
by <persName>Satsuma-no-kami's</persName> men and the letter taken from him, but
when they came to read it, it was only a letter to his wife, so as
there was no harm in it, they restored it to him. Then <persName>Tadakiyo</persName>
asked him how many men the <orgName>Genji</orgName> had, whereupon he replied:
<pb n="247" xml:id="p271-247"/>

"I have knowledge of only from four or five hundred to a
thousand of them, but for these last seven or eight days they
have been coming in, so that everywhere on plain, mountain,
sea and river there is nothing to be seen but armed men, and
yesterday at the <placeName>Kisegawa</placeName> they said that the whole force of the
<persName>Genji</persName> amounted to some two hundred thousand men.” "Ah,"
exclaimed <persName>Kazusa-no-kami</persName>, “if only I had not advised the Com-
mander-in-Chief to delay! That is indeed regrettable; even if
I had attacked a day sooner. But why do not the <persName>Oba</persName>
brothers and <persName>Hatakeyama</persName> come up? If they join us all the
forces of <placeName>Izu</placeName> and <placeName>Tsuruga</placeName> will come with them." But his regret
now availed him nothing.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Gon-no-suke Shosho Koremori</persName> summoned to him
<persName>Nagai-no-Saito Betto Sanemori</persName>, who was their guide to the
eastern provinces, and asked him : 'Are there many samurai
in the eight eastern provinces who are as mighty archers and as
bold as you are?" "Do you then consider me a mighty
archer?" answered <persName>Sanemori</persName> with a scornful smile, "I only
draw an arrow of thirteen handbreadths, and in the eastern
provinces there are any number of Bushi who can do that.. One
who is really a famous archer never draws a shaft of less than
fifteen, and his bow is so strong that it needs four or five
ordinary men to bend it. When these shoot they can easily pierce
two or three suits of armour at once. Those who have the title
of Daimyo never ride with less than five hundred horsemen, and
they are bold riders who know not how to fall, neither do their
horses stumble even on the roughest ground. Moreover when
they fight they do not heed even if their own parents or children
are killed, but ride on over their bodies and continue the battle.
The samurai of the western provinces are quite different. If
their parents are killed they retire and perform Buddhist rites
for the repose of their souls, and make the customary mourning;
if their children are slain they are overcome with grief and can
fight no more. When they grow the rice for the soldiers'
rations they plant the fields in the spring and reap them in the
<pb n="248" xml:id="p272-248"/>

autumn and then go out to fight; they dislike the summer
because it is hot and grumble at the cold of winter.
This is not
the way of the warriors of the eastern provinces.
Moreover the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of <placeName>Kai</placeName> and <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, as they know the
ground well, will most likely come round the plains at the foot
of Mt. <placeName>Fuji</placeName> to take us in the rear. Perhaps you may think that
I speak thus with the intention of causing apprehension in the
mind of the General, but that is not so, for an army does not
depend on the number of its men, but on the strategy of the
Commander."
</p>
<p>
Now the hour of Hare (6 a.m.) on the twenty-fourth day
was the time fixed for the beginning of the fight between the two
armies, so on the preceding evening the outposts of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
went forth to observe the disposition of the enemy. But the
farmers and inhabitants of <placeName>Izu</placeName> and <placeName>Suruga</placeName>, in terror at the
movements of the armies, had fled away, some to the moorland, some
to the hills, and some in boats on the sea and river, and had
kindled their cooking fires everywhere, so that the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, seeing
them on all sides, were struck with consternation, exclaiming :
"Ah, see! the camp-fires of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> are without number!
Truly the mountains and sea and river and plain are all full of
warriors. What is to be done?" Also about the middle of the
same night the water-fowl of the marshes of Mt. <placeName>Fuji</placeName> were
startled by something or other, and rose suddenly all together
with a whirring of wings like the sound of thunder or a mighty
wind, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> soldiers hearing it shouted out: “It is the
army of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> coming on to attack us! <persName>Saito Betto</persName> warned
us yesterday that the men of <placeName>Kai</placeName> and <placeName>Shinano</placeName> would come
round the foot of <placeName>Fuji</placeName> to take us in the rear. There are
hundreds of thousands of them. We must fall back to the <placeName>Owari</placeName>
river at <placeName>Sunomata</placeName> or we shall be cut off." So, panic-stricken,
they abandoned their positions and fled precipitately without even
taking their belongings with them, for so great was their haste
that some snatched up their bows without any arrows, or arrows
without any bow, springing on to each other's horses, and even
<pb n="249" xml:id="p273-249"/>

mounting tethered animals and whipping them up so that they
galloped round and round the post to which they were tied.
There were some too who had procured some singing girls and
courtesans, and were banqueting and making merry with them
when the alarm took place, and these women were hustled and
thrown down and trampled on in the confusion, so that they were
injured in the head or body and added their cries to the uproar.
</p>
<p>
Then on the twenty-fourth day at the hour of the Hare, the
<persName>Genji</persName>, numbering two hundred thousand horsemen, advanced to
the <placeName>Fujikawa</placeName> and shouted their war cry three times so that the
heavens reverberated and the earth shook, but on the side of the
<persName>Heike</persName> there was nought but silence. When the vanguard
approached their camp there was not a man to be seen, whereupon
they raised a shout that the enemy had fled, while some went
and gathered up the armour they had left behind, and others
bore away in triumph the curtains of the camp that had been left
standing. "There is not so much as a fly stirring in the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
camp," they reported to their Commander.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Hyoe-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> alighted from his horse, and,
taking off his helmet, washed his hands and rinsed his mouth.
Turning toward the Imperial Palace he reverently made
obeisance and said: 'It is not through any merit on my part that
this victory has been gained, it is owing to the favour of <persName>Hachiman Dai-bosatsu</persName> and none other."
</p>
<p>
Then the provinces that were captured were assigned,
<placeName>Suruga</placeName> to <persName>Ichijo-no Jiro Tadayori</persName>, and <placeName>Totomi</placeName> to <persName>Yasuda-no-Saburo Yoshisada</persName>, and as it was not advisable to extend the
attack further, owing to the uncertainty of the situation in his
rear, the leader of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> withdrew his forces again to
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName>. At this time the singing-girls and courtesans who
dwelt by the sea-shore mocked the <orgName>Heike</orgName> saying: "Ah, what
a disgusting General to run away and avoid a battle; how
mean-spirited are these <persName>Heike</persName>, not only do they but look at
the enemy and run away, they listen to our songs and run
away without paying!" Besides this several lampoons were
<pb n="250" xml:id="p274-250"/>

written on the <orgName>Heike</orgName> leaders, <persName>Munemori</persName> the Commander in the
Capital, and <persName>Gon-no-suke</persName> who lead their armies in the field,
<persName>Heike</persName> being read' Hiraya':
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Hiraya naru munemori ika ni sawagurammu</l>
<l>Hashira to tanomu suke wo otoshite."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"How will <persName>Munemori</persName>, the roof of the structure, be shaken,</l>

</lg>
<p>
and also:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Swift-flowing over the rocks runs the foaming flood of the</l>
<l><placeName>Fuji</placeName>;</l>
<l>Swifter the <persName>Ise Heishi</persName> scamper away in their flight."</l>
</lg>
<p>
These two also deride <persName>Kazusa-no-kami Tadakiyo</persName> for
leaving his armour behind him at the <placeName>Fujikawa</placeName>:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"<placeName>Fujikawa</placeName> ni yoroi wa sutetsu sumisome no</l>
<l>Koromo tada kiyo nochi no yo no tame.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Leaving his armour behind by the banks of the river of <placeName>Fuji</placeName>,</l>
<l>Only remains the black gown meet for a happier re-birth.”</l>
</lg>
<lg>

<p>On the eighth day of the eleventh month the Commander-

</p>
<p><pb n="251" xml:id="p275-251"/>

Lay-priest Chancellor was exceedingly angry, and immediately
ordered him to be exiled to <placeName>Kikai-ga-shima</placeName> and <persName>Tadakiyo</persName> to be
put to death. On the next day the <orgName>Heike</orgName> retainers to the
number of many hundred of all ages assembled to discuss whether
the death sentence onght to be carried out, and <persName>Shume-no-Hang-
wan Morikuni</persName> stood up before the assembly and said: “I
certainly do not consider <persName>Tadakiyo</persName> to be a man wanting in
courage; for when he was only eighteen years old, and the two
most desperate bandits of the whole <placeName>Kinai</placeName> took refuge in the
treasury of the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName> and no one dared to go in and seize
them, alone he climbed over the wall in broad daylight, and
after killing one brought the other out alive, an exploit that is
celebrated to this day. So I think there was something
mysterious about this disaster. We must at any rate consider this
disorder among the army with great care."
On the tenth day
there was an investiture of officials and <persName>Gon-no-suke Shosho
Koremori</persName> was promoted to be Ukonye-no-Chujo, whereat
everyone wondered what the reason might be ; since his expedition to
the eastern provinces had not been exactly meritorious.
</p>
<p>
Long ago, when <persName>Taira Sadamori</persName> and <persName>Tawara Toda Hide-
sato</persName> started for the east country to subdue <persName>Masakado</persName>, and did
not find the task at all easy, after a council of Courtiers it was
decided to send another expedition under <persName>Uji-no-Mimbu Kyo
Tadabun</persName> and <persName>Kiyohara-no-Shigefuji</persName>, and they, having been
granted the rank of Gunken or Director of Operations, at once
set out for the east. When they arrived at <placeName>Kiyomi-ga-seki</placeName> in
the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName>, <persName>Shigefuji</persName>, looking out over the surging
billows of the sea at night, softly hummed to himself the Chinese
poem of <persName>Hakurakuten</persName>:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"The flares of the fishing-boats throw a warm glow on the billows;</l>
<l>The jingling of the Courtier's bell sounds over the hills at eve."</l>
</lg>
<p>
so that <persName>Tadabun</persName> was moved to tears by the feelings it evoked.
Then the first two leaders, having in the meanwhile at last
<pb n="252" xml:id="p276-252"/>

overcome <persName>Masakado</persName>, met the other two Generals there as they
were returning with his head, and all went up to the Capital
together. <persName>Sadamori</persName> and <persName>Hidesato</persName> were rewarded, and many
thought that <persName>Tadabun</persName> and <persName>Shigefuji</persName> should also receive rewards,
so the Courtiers held a council, at which <persName>Kujo Ujo-no-Sho Moro-
suke Ko</persName> spoke as follows: As the expedition of last year was
not able to overcome the enemy, <persName>Tadabun</persName> and <persName>Shigefuji</persName> were
appointed to do so, but just as they had arrived at the eastern
boundary he was at last taken, why then should they not be
rewarded also?" But his elder brother <persName>Ono-no-Miya Saneyori</persName>,
who presided, opposed it saying: "If there is any doubt, leț
the matter rest; everything must be according to the written
precedent." And so nothing was done, whereupon <persName>Tadabun</persName>,
greatly disappointed, swore that the descendants of <persName>Ono-no-miya</persName>
should become servants, but that he would protect the family of
<persName>Kujo Dono</persName> for ever; after which he starved himself so that he
died. And to this day the family of <persName>Kujo Dono</persName> has enjoyed
great prosperity, while none of the descendants of his elder
brother are now to be found among the higher nobles, for they
are wholly extinct.
</p>
<p>
On the eleventh day of the same month the fourth son of
the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, <persName>To-no-Chujo Shigehira</persName> was promoted to be Sakon-
ye-no-Gon Chujo. On the thirteenth day the palace at <placeName>Fuku-
hara</placeName> was finished and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> moved into it. The
ceremony of Daijoe or Accession to the Throne should now
have been held, but it was fixed for the end of the tenth month,
and His Majesty proceeded to the eastern river for the Ceremony
of Purification. The place for the Daijoe was a plain to
the north of the Palace where the Imperial Vestures and
other objects to be used in the ceremony were arranged. In
front of the <placeName>Daikyokuden</placeName> at the foot of the dais in the
enclosed path called <placeName>Ryubi-do</placeName>, or the <placeName>Way of the Dragon's
Tail</placeName>, the <placeName>Kairitsuden</placeName>, in which the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> bathed and
robed, was set up. By the side of the same dais was erected
the <placeName>Daijogu</placeName> in which His Majesty made the offerings to the Im-
<pb n="253" xml:id="p277-253"/>

perial Ancestors, where the Deities were feasted and entertained.
In the <placeName>Daikyokuden</placeName> also a great ceremony was held, not to
speak of the Kagura, the Sacred Dance in the <placeName>Seishodo</placeName>, and the
Imperial Banquet in the <placeName>Burakuin</placeName>. But in this new capital of
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> there was no <placeName>Daikyokuden</placeName>, so that the ceremony
could not be performed; there was no <placeName>Seishodo</placeName>, so that the
Kagura could not take place, and there was no <placeName>Burakuin</placeName> the
Banquet, so it was decided to celebrate only the Shinjosai, or
Offering of the New Rice, and the Gosetsu this year, but after
a council of Courtiers it was decreed that this also should be
performed by the Shrine officials in the old Capital. Now the
origin of the Gosetsu dance is that in the time of <persName>Temmu Tenno</persName>,
one night, when there was a keen breeze and a clear moon, they
were playing the Biwa in the <placeName>Palace of Yoshino</placeName> to calm the mind
of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, when a Celestial Maiden came down from
Heaven and waved her sleeves five times.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14" xml:id="v5_ch14">
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>THE RETURN TO THE CAPITAL.</head>
<p>The removal of the capital to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> had displeased
everyone from the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> downwards, and all the <persName>Courtiers</persName> had
made great lamentation and complaint, appealing to all the shrines
and temples of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> and <placeName>Nara</placeName> and every other place against
this arbitrary outrage, so at length even the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, who would
try to tear paper crossways, had to give way, which he did by
issuing a Court Order to return to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> immediately.
</p>
<p>
So on the second day of the eleventh month the capital was
suddenly changed again. The new capital was situated in a place
where the mountains towered up steeply above it on the north,
while the sea washed close up on the south, and the incessant
roar of the waves and the salt spray made it unendurable, so that
<persName>Takakura Shinin</persName> was always ailing and was delighted to leave as
soon as possible, so he quickly departed with the <roleName>Empress</roleName> and
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, while the <persName>Sessho</persName>, the <persName>Dajo-daijin</persName> and the rest of the
<pb n="254" xml:id="p278-254"/>

<persName>Courtiers</persName> eagerly accompanied them. Then the <persName>Dajo Nyudo</persName>
and all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> followed, and as no one wished to remain
there even for a short time, so great was their desire to return to
the old Capital, it was soon quite deserted. Ever since the sixth
month the buildings had been falling into ruins, since they were
but frames only, and now, when the order to return to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>
was issued, everyone was so anxious to go away quickly that
they left everything standing as it was and hurried off. On
returning both the <persName>Retired Emperors</persName> proceeded to the <placeName>Ikedono</placeName> at
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, while the <persName>Reigning Emperor</persName> took up his abode at
the <placeName>Gojo Palace</placeName>. The <persName>Courtiers</persName>, as they had nowhere to lodge,
took refuge in the temples aud shrines of <placeName>Hachiman</placeName>, <placeName>Kamo</placeName>,
<placeName>Saga</placeName>, <placeName>Uzumasa</placeName>, and all the others that were scattered about over
<placeName>Nishiyama</placeName> and <placeName>Higashiyama</placeName>, and even the greatest of them did
not scorn to take up their quarters in the corridors of the temples
or the storehouses of the shrines.
</p>
<p>
Now as to the reason for changing the capital to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>,
it was because <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> was so near to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and the slightest
thing was sufficient to make the monks bring the sacred car of
<placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> or the sacred tree of <placeName>Kasuga</placeName> into the city and cause a
tumult, so no doubt the <persName>Nyudo</persName> thought that the site of the new
capital would not be so easy for them to threaten, since it was
some distance away with mountains and rivers between.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty-third day an expedition was begun against the
<persName>Genji</persName> of <placeName>Omi</placeName>, and <persName>Sahyoe-no-kami Tomomori</persName> and <persName>Satsuma-no-
kami Tadanori</persName> started for that province with an army of thirty
thousand horsemen, and after having defeated <persName>Yamamoto</persName>,
<persName>Kashiwagi</persName>, <persName>Nishigori</persName> and other rebel bands, they crossed over
to <placeName>Mino</placeName> and <placeName>Owari</placeName>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15" xml:id="v5_ch15">
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>THE BURNING OF NARA.</head>
<p>Now <placeName>Nara</placeName> was regarded as a rebel against the Throne
because it had sided with <placeName>Miidera</placeName> and (received <persName>Prince Taka-
<pb n="255" xml:id="p279-255"/>

kura</persName> when he led the revolt, and when the priests of the
<placeName>Kofukuji</placeName> heard that an attack on them was being considered,
they rose like a swarm of angry bees, and when the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>
sent them a message by <persName>Ukwan-no-Betto Tadanari</persName> to the effect
that he would report to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> anything that they had to
say, they tore the messenger from his palanquin, threw him
down, and cut off his hair, so that he fled back to the Capital
pale and terrified. Then <persName>Saemon-no-kami Chikamasa</persName> was sent
a second time, whereupon they treated him in the same way,
while two retainers of the University of the Kwangaku-in had
their queues cut off at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Beside this the priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName> made a great wooden head
which they struck and kicked about, calling it the head of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName>. Now the rapid spreading of rumour is a thing that
invites misfortune, and want of caution in speech is the way that
leads to destruction, and this <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName>, we speak it
with the deepest reverence, was the maternal grandfather of the
<persName>Reigning Emperor</persName>, so that these things that the priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName>
did seemed to everyone like the acts of devils. Now the <persName>Nyudo</persName>
had attached <persName>Seno-no-Taro Kaneyasu</persName> to the Kebiishi of the
province of <placeName>Yamato</placeName> with the intent to calm the turbulence of the
priests, and <persName>Kaneyasu</persName> rode off thither with five hundred
horsemen. <persName>Kiyomori</persName> charged him, however, on no account to display
any force, and not to use arms even if they offered violence, but
the monks, unaware of this, seized some sixty of his men, cut off
their heads and stuck them up all round the <placeName>Pool of Sarusawa</placeName>.
On hearing this the <persName>Nyudo</persName> declared in great anger: "Now I
will certainly attack the <placeName>South Capital</placeName>," and forthwith ordered
<persName>To-no-Chujo Shigehira</persName> and <persName>Chugu-no-suke Michimori</persName> to set out
thither with an army of about forty thousand horsemen. At
<placeName>Nara</placeName> about seven thousand monks, young and old, without
distinction, put on their armour and took up their position at
<placeName>Narasaka</placeName> and <placeName>Hannyaji</placeName>, digging ditches across the road and
making breast works and palisades. The <persName>Heike</persName>, dividing
their forces into two, raised their warcry and attacked both these
<pb n="256" xml:id="p280-256"/>

places. The monks fought on foot while the Imperial Army
fought on horseback, and as they kept on riding up continuously
to the attack, the ranks of <placeName>Nara</placeName> were thinned and they began to
give ground, so that by nightfall, after fighting from early
morning, both of their positions were broken through. Now
among the retiring priests was a warrior-monk named <persName>Saka-no-
shiro Yogaku</persName>, who for strength and valour was equal to all the
temples of <placeName>Nara</placeName> put together: he wore two suits of armour one
over the other, a black body-armour over another suit with
lacings of light-green silk, and two helmets likewise, one of five
plates over a steel cap, while he brandished a white-handled
halberd, curved like a reed, in one hand and a huge tachi with
black mounts in the other. Gathering some ten of his comrades
of the same temple round him, he held the enemy at the <placeName>Tengai</placeName>
gate for some time and slew very many, but as fast as they fell
others came on, so at last when his comrades had all fallen,
though his heart was still undaunted, being in danger of being
surrounded, he escaped by flight to the <placeName>south country</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Then the Commander <persName>To-no-Chujo Shigehira</persName>, standing in
front of the gate of <placeName>Hannaji</placeName>, as it had now become dark, ordered
fires to be lit, when a certain lower provincial official of <placeName>Harima</placeName>
named <persName>Jirodaiyu Tomokata</persName> split up his wooden shield into
torches and set fire to the houses near by. It was the hour of
the Dog (5 p.m.) of the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month
and the wind was blowing strongly, so that although only one
place was set on fire, owing to the wind veering about in all
directions, the flames spread hither and thither and most of the
temple buildings were soon in a blaze. By this time all the
warrior monks who scorned to surrender for fear of dishonour had
fallen fighting at <placeName>Narasaka</placeName> and <placeName>Hannyaji</placeName>, and those who remained
fled towards <placeName>Yoshino</placeName> and <placeName>Totsugawa</placeName>. Those who were too old
to flee, and the unattached laymen, children and girls, thinking
to save themselves, went up into the upper story of the <placeName>Dai-
butsu-den</placeName> or fled into the interior of <placeName>Yamashinadera</placeName> in their
panic. About a thousand of them crowded into the <placeName>Daibutsu-
<pb n="257" xml:id="p281-257"/>

den</placeName> and pulled up the ladders behind them so that the enemy
could not follow, but the flames reached them first, and such a
great crying arose as could not be surpassed even by the sinners
amid the flames of Tapana, Pratapana and Avitchi, the fiercest of
the Eight Hot Hells.
</p>
<p>
The <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName>, alas! the ancient tutelary temple of the
<persName>Fujiwara</persName> house, founded by Prince <persName>Fuhito</persName>, was burned; the
<placeName>Tokondo</placeName> with its famous statue of <persName>S'akya Muni</persName> the Founder of
the Buddhist Doctrine, the <placeName>Saikondo</placeName> with its <persName>Kwannon of the
Bubbling Springs</persName>, the <placeName>Emerald Gallery</placeName>, the <placeName>Vermilion Hall of
Two Stories</placeName>, the two Pagodas that lifted their shining spires to
heaven, all were consumed to ashes in a moment.
The <placeName>Todaiji</placeName>,
which was built by <persName>Shomu Tenno</persName> himself, who was considered
as one who on this earth had entered into the domains of the
third and fourth Buddha-fields, was destroyed also, and the
colossal statue of <persName>Vairochana Buddha</persName> of copper and gold, whose
domed head towered up into the clouds, from which gleamed the
sacred jewel of his lofty forehead, fused with the heat, so that its
fullmoon features fell to the pavement below, while its body melted
into a shapeless mass. The myriad beauties of his Buddha
Presence were hidden in the smoke like the autumn moon
among the clouds, and the jewelled ornaments of the Bodhisat
shone fitfully like the drifting stars on a stormy night. The
whole sky was filled with smoke, and the flames roared
upward continually. Those who stood looking on averted
their gaze, and even those who heard it related felt faint
with awe.
Of the Holy Sutras of the Hosso and Sanron
sects not one volume survived; surely never before had
there been such a destruction of Holy Writ, not only in our
country but even in <placeName>India</placeName> or <placeName>China</placeName>. Even the statue of <persName>Buddha</persName>
that <persName>Udayana Raja</persName> made of fine gold, and that which <persName>Vis'var-
karman</persName> carved from red sandal-wood, were scarcely life-size,
much less likely did it seem then that this, the greatest Buddha
in all the <placeName>Djambudvipa</placeName>, would thus fall to ruin. Now, mingled
with dust and smoke, it lies low, an abiding sorrow to all. How
<pb n="258" xml:id="p282-258"/>

must the <persName>Four Deva Kings</persName>, the <persName>Eight Dragon Sea-gods</persName>, and the
<persName>Judges and Custodians of the Underworld</persName> have been struck
with amazement, and what must have been the concern of
<persName>Kasuga Daimyojin</persName>, the Tutelary Deity of the <persName>Fujiwara</persName> house?
Even the dew of Mt. <placeName>Kasuga</placeName> changed its hue and the wind
howled mournfully on Mt. <placeName>Mikasa</placeName>. Of those that perished in
the flames there were seventeen hundred in the <placeName>Daibutsu-den</placeName>
and eight hundred in the <placeName>Yamashinadera</placeName>; in another temple
there were five hundred and in yet another three hundred ; in all
some three thousand five hundred souls. A thousand monks
fell in the fight, some of whose heads were stuck up on the gate
of the <placeName>Hannyaji</placeName>, while some were carried back to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>. The
<persName>Nyudo</persName> alone was greatly rejoiced at the news, for the <orgName>Empress</orgName>,
the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> all sorrowed exceedingly at
the destruction of so many temples, though willing that the
turbulent monks should be exterminated. The <persName>Courtiers</persName> had
decided in council that the heads of the monks should be carried
through the streets and exposed on the public gibbet, but
concerning this deplorable destruction of the <placeName>Todaiji</placeName> and <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName>
nothing was determined. The ruins lay as they were scattered
everywhere in the moats and ditches. Now in the Imperial
writing of <persName>Shomu Tenno</persName> is this sentence: "When my temple of
<placeName>Kofukuji</placeName> is prosperous the whole Empire shall be prosperous,
and when my temple falls to ruin the Empire will decline also."
And now it seems that we are indeed to behold the fall of the
Empire. Thus this ill-omened year came to an end and the
fourth year of Jisho began.

<head>DEATH OF THE RETIRED EMPEROR TAKAKURA.</head>
<p>On account of the rebellion in the eastern provinces and
the burning of the temples of the <placeName>South Capital</placeName>, the customary
ceremonies of the first day of the New Year were not performed
in this fifth year of Jisho, so that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> did not hold any
reception, there was no music or Bugaku, the envoys from
<placeName>Yoshino</placeName> did not come, and not one of the <persName>Courtiers</persName> of the <persName>Fuji-
wara</persName> family appeared. This was because of the burning of
their tutelary temple. On the second day no banquet was
given at the Court and no one either of the <persName>Courtiers</persName> or <persName>Ladies-
in-waiting</persName> was to be seen; the whole Palace was deserted and
forlorn. It was most grievous to see that both the Law of
<persName>Buddha</persName> and the Throne had quite lost their influence.
"There
are four generations of <persName>Emperors</persName> now living at the same time,"
complained the <persName>Ho-o</persName> bitterly," and since they are all deprived
of any hand in the administration, there is nothing else for them
but to pass their lives uselessly."
</p>
<p>
On the fifth day the high ecclesiastics of <placeName>Nara</placeName> were all
relieved of their official rank and prohibited from entering the
Palace, both their place and office being sequestrated. Now as
it was necessary that some of these priests should take part in
one of the Services held at this time of year, and all those of
<placeName>Nara</placeName> had been degraded, it was proposed that the priests
of <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> should act instead, but after the <persName>Courtiers</persName> had
discussed it they discovered a certain priest of the Sanron Sect
experienced in the required proceedure, who had escaped
and concealed himself in <placeName>Kwanshuji</placeName>, and him they summoned
to go through the bare form of the ceremony. Now there was
not a single priest to be found in <placeName>Nara</placeName>, for the very few that had
<pb n="260" xml:id="p284-260"/>

escaped being killed with arrow or sword or burnt to death or
suffocated in the smoke had fled to the mountains and woods.
Among these was the <persName>Betto of Kofukuji</persName>, <persName>Gerin-in-no-Sojo Yoen</persName>,
who was so overcome at seeing all the precious statues and
holy books go up in smoke that he fell ill and eventually died.
This <persName>Yoen</persName> was a person of very delicate taste, and once, on
hearing the cuckoo, he made this verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Charming always it is to hear the voice of the cuckoo,</l>
<l>Every time it is heard, always it seems like the first."</l>
</lg>
<note type="romaji" place="bottom">Hatsune. Kiku tabi ni mezurashikereba hototogisu
Itsumo hatsune no kokochi koso tsure.</note>
<p>
Therefore he was ever after called' <persName>Hatsune no Sojo</persName>' (first
note Sojo).
</p>
<p>
Now the trouble of the last few years, that is, the
confinement of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> in the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName> the year before last, the
execution of <persName>Prince Takakura</persName> the year after, and the troubled and
critical state of the Empire generally, not to speak of the
changing of the Capital, so wrought on the health of the <persName>Retired
Emperor Takakura</persName> that he sickened and become very ill, and
now, when he heard of the destruction of <placeName>Todaiji</placeName> and <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName>,
his condition grew serious, and at length on the fourteenth day
of the same month he passed away at the <placeName>Ikedono</placeName> of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>,
to the intense grief of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, after a reign of twelve years.
His virtuous rule raised up the ways of benevolence and justice
that had been abandoned, and continued the way of equity and
happiness that had been interrupted, and although in this world
of vicissitudes and impermanence death is a thing that cannot be
avoided, even by an <persName>Arhat</persName> who possesses the <term>Three Clear Con-
ceptions</term> and the <term>Six Supernatural Talents</term>, or by an <persName>Incarnate
Deity</persName> who can assume all forms, yet in his case it seemed indeed
contrary to reason. Yet that night he was borne to the
temple of <placeName>Seiganji</placeName> at the foot of <placeName>Higashiyama</placeName>, and was wafted
upwards like the smoke of evening or the mist of spring-time.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Choken Hoin</persName> was hastening down from <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> to attend
</p>
<p><pb n="261" xml:id="p285-261"/>

the funeral ceremony, but while still on the way he saw the
smoke ascending, and immediately bursting into tears he made
this stanza:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"If today we enquire of the journey our Sovereign travels,</l>
<l>Mournful will be the reply; whence he shall never return."</l>
</lg>
<p>
This verse too was composed about the Emperor's death
by one of his ladies.
</p>
<lg>
<l>Like to the moon that passes above the clouds from our vision;</l>
<l>What is our grief to see darkened the light of our life.</l>
</lg>
<p>
During the twenty one years of his life His Majesty had
always observed the Ten Precepts, and had been especially
compassionate; never had he transgressed the Five Virtues and his
courtesy was unfailing. A wise Monarch in this degenerate
age, the regret of his subjects was extreme, even as though the
sun and moon had ceased to give their light. Thus the people's
wish was not granted, and this ill-fortune came upon his subjects,
so that sadness brooded over the whole Empire.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2" xml:id="v6_ch2">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>AUTUMN LEAVES.</head>
<p>While <persName>Takakura Tenno</persName> was on the Throne everybody
declared that his consideration for others surpassed even that of
the <persName>Mikados</persName> of the periods Enki and Tenryaku, and though
generally speaking it was after he had attained to years of
discrimination that he obtained his reputation for wisdom and
benevolence, yet his disposition was kind and gentle from his
earliest childhood.
</p>
<p>
During the period Shoan, when His Majesty was only
about ten years old, being extremely fond of the tinted leaves
of autumn, he had a little hill-garden made in the north
enclosure of the Palace, and planted it with maple and 'haze' trees
<pb n="262" xml:id="p286-262"/>

that redden beautifully in that season, calling it 'The Hill of
Autumn Tints' and from morning till evening he never seemed
to tire of looking at it. But one night a late autumn gale blew
violently and scattered the leaves everywhere in confusion, so
the next morning, when the Palace servants went round early as
usual to clean the grounds, they swept up all the fallen leaves
and the broken branches as well, and as it was a bleak and
cheerless morning they made a fire with them in the court of
the <placeName>Nuidono</placeName>, and heated some sake to warm themselves. Soon
afterwards the <persName>Kurando</persName> in waiting, hastening to inspect the
garden before the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> should see it, and finding nothing
there, enquired the reason and the servants told him. "What?"
he exclaimed, "how could you dare to treat the garden that
the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> is so fond of in such a way? You deserve
to be imprisoned or banished at least, and I too may very likely
incur the Imperial displeasure." Just then the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, coming
out to see his favourite trees as soon as he had left his
bedchamber, was surprised to find they had all disappeared,
and the <persName>Kurando</persName> told him what had happened. To his surprise
His Majesty was not at all angry, but only laughed and quoted
a Chinese poem by <persName>Haku-raku-ten</persName> about warming sake in the
woods by burning maple-leaves. "I wonder" he said, "who
can have taught it them. Really they are quite esthetes."
</p>
<p>
Again in the period Angen, one night when the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
was sleeping in a strange part of the Palace according to the
advice of the diviners, being naturally wakeful, he could not
get to sleep. Perchance it may be that, as the poem says, the
voice of the Palace watchman makes a Monarch wakeful, or as
the night was very cold he may have been thinking of the
occasion when <persName>Saga Tenno</persName>, on just such a frosty night, feeling
compassion for the suffering of his people, stripped off his own
bed clothes and exposed himself to the cold, and regretting that
he himself could not emulate the virtue of such an Emperor.
Thus being more wakful than usual, he heard late at night the
sound of someone crying out some distance away, and im-
<pb n="263" xml:id="p287-263"/>

mediately summoned an attendant and ordered him to go and
find out what it was. When the Courtier on guard went out
and searched, he discovered a poor girl in one of the lanes near
carrying the lid of a clothes-chest and weeping bitterly. On his
enquiring the cause, she told him that she was carrying home
some clothes which her mistress, who was a lady-in-waiting at
the the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, could barely afford to have made,
when two or three ruffians suddenly robbed her of them, and
that her mistress could not continue to serve unless she had the
proper clothes, and she did not know anyone who could help
her, and so she was crying. On hearing this the Courtier
brought the girl back with him and reported the whole affair to
the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, who was moved to tears at the story. "Alas!
how cruel" he exclaimed," who could do such a thing? In
the days of the <persName>Emperor Gyo</persName> in <placeName>China</placeName> the people reflected the
goodness of their Ruler and were good too, but now in this age
the people have only me to imitate and so they are very wicked.
When wrong is done in the Empire, ought I not to be
ashamed?" Then he asked what kind of garment it was, and
on being told, he bade the <persName>Imperial Consort Kenreimon-in</persName> give
her one of same kind, whereupon they brought a dress far more
beautiful than the former one and gave it to the girl. Then the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>, fearful lest she might again be molested, as the hour
was so late, ordered several of the Imperial Guards to escort
her as far as the house of her mistress. It was not strange then
that everyone, even the poorest and meanest of his subjects,
should pray for the long life of this virtuous Sovereign.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3" xml:id="v6_ch3">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>AOI-NO-MAE.</head>
<p>Another story that has a certain pathetic interest is this.
There was a certain little maiden who served one of the
<persName>Empress's</persName> ladies-in-waiting, who was much beloved by the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>, and it was no ordinary passing fancy but a true
<pb n="264" xml:id="p288-264"/>

and deep affection, so that her mistress no longer allowed her
to wait on her, but rather treated her as her superior and paid
her great deference and attention. An ancient poem says;
"Do
not rejoice when a son is born, and do not despair when you
have a daughter, for a son does not always become a Prince,
while a daughter may become Imperial Consort and Empress."
What a happy future might be before this little maid. She
might become Nyogo and Imperial Consort, then Mother of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> and at last <persName>Retired Empress</persName>. Her name was <persName>Aoi-no-
mae</persName>, but the ladies of the Court already spoke of her
confidentially among themselves as <persName>Aoi-no-Nyogo</persName>.

<p>
But when the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> heard of this he ceased to summon
her to his presence: this was not because he had become tired
of her, but because he feared the censure of the world, and
being naturally of a brooding disposition he lost all taste for food,
and falling sick became unable to leave the Imperial Bed-
chamber. Then the <persName>Kwampaku Matsudono</persName>, hearing that His
Majesty was thus depressed, hastened to the Palace to comfort
him. "Why does Your Majesty thus fret about this affair? "
he said, "for there is nothing to worry about. Let the maid be
summoned again; her low rank need be no obstacle, for I will
make her my adopted daughter and then she need fear no
comparisons." "Ah no,” replied the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, "that cannot be ;
after I have retired from the Throne such a thing might be done,
but the actions of a Reigning Emperor must be above the
criticism of posterity." So, as his Master would not at all
entertain the idea, the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> could do no more, but with
tears in his eyes retired from the Palace. Afterwards the <persName>Em-
peror</persName> wrote this verse on a sheet of paper tinted in light green :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Plain indeed is my love, for though I try to conceal it,</l>
<l>All my friends enquire what I am brooding about.”</l>
</lg>
<p>
This was an old poem written by <persName>Taira Kanemori</persName>, but as it
expressed his feelings the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> gave it to <persName>Reizei-no-Shonagon
Takafusa</persName> to convey to <persName>Aoi-no-Mae</persName>, who, when she had received
it and read it, blushing deeply put it away in her bosom, and
<pb n="265" xml:id="p289-265"/>

then, overcome by the violence of her feelings, immediately left
the Court and returned to her home, where she took to her bed
and died after about a week. Very applicable to a case like this
are the lines of <persName>Haku-raku-ten</persName>; "The hand-maid will rue one
day of her lord's favour for a hundred years," and everyone
said that the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> feeling was just like that of the <persName>Emperor
Taiso</persName> of <placeName>To</placeName> who wished to introduce the daughter of <persName>Tei-jin-ki</persName>
into the <placeName>Genkwanden</placeName>, but when <persName>Gicho</persName> reproved him, and told
him that she was already betrothed to <persName>Rikushi</persName>, he gave up his
intention.

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>KOGO.</head>
<p>As the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was so much grieved by this unhappy love
episode the <roleName>Empress</roleName> sent one of her own ladies to him to console
him. Her name was <persName>Kogo</persName> and she was the daughter of <persName>Sakura-
machi-no-Chunagon Shigenori Kyo</persName>, and not only was she the
greatest beauty in the Palace but she was also without equal for
her skill in playing the Koto. She had been beloved by <persName>Reizei-no-Dainagon Takafusa Kyo</persName>, and while he was only Shosho he sent
her many poems and letters, but for some time they only
accumulated without producing any effect, until at last she was moved
to take pity on him and yielded. But now she was summoned to
the side of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> they could not but part, and for long
her sleeves were moistened with tears of regret. The <persName>Shosho</persName> too
was always going to the Palace to try if by any means he could
see her once again, and used to loiter about in the
neighbourhood of her apartment, but as she was now in the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName>
household she would not exchange a word with him, or show,
however indirectly, that she still had any tender feelings for him.
Then the <persName>Shosho</persName> wrote a stanza and threw it so that it fell within
the curtain of the room where she was. The lines ran as
follows:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Near though I am to my love she is far removed as the</l>
<l>Northland:</l>
<pb n="266" xml:id="p290-266"/>

<l>Were she in <placeName>Mutsu</placeName> indeed, how would it differ from this?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
Though in her heart <persName>Kogo</persName> would have liked to answer it, yet
for the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> sake and to avoid causing him any pain she
did not even touch it, but bade one of her maids pick it up and
throw it out into the courtyard. <persName>Takafusa</persName> could hardly contain
his anger and disappointment at this treatment, but,
remembering that if he were seen the results would be serious, he hastily
picked up the paper, and, putting it in his bosom, returned to his
house and gave vent to his feelings in these lines :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Cruel! she designs not even to take my poor verse in her fingers,</l>
<l>Yet however she feels, never my heart can forget."</l>
</lg>
<p>
And he prayed that he might die rather than continue to
live on in the world when he could no longer see her.
</p>
<p>
But when these things came to the ears of the
<persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName> he burst forth: "What a a condition
of things is this! The <roleName>Empress</roleName> is my daughter and the
wife of <persName>Reizei Shosho</persName> is my daughter also, and how does this
<persName>Kogo</persName> dare to take the husband of both ? Let her be put out of
the way forthwith! Then <persName>Kogo</persName>, caring nothing about her
own fate, but anxious lest the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> should in any way be
troubled, fled away one night from the Palace so that no one
knew whither she had gone. This grieved the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
exceedingly, and he would not leave his bed-chamber, but spent his
days moping and in tears. When the <persName>Nyudo</persName> heard of this he
remarked: "Ah, His Majesty is distressed about <persName>Kogo</persName> I see,
then something must be done," and he gave orders that none of
the Ladies-in-waiting were to be allowed to attend the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>,
and as he even frowned on other people who paid visits. no one
went to Court at all, since they did not care to risk offending
him, and all the Palace was gloomy and deserted. Now on the
tenth day of the eighth month there was a most beautitul moon
without a trace of clouds in the sky, and His Majesty was
gazing at it, but as his eyes were full of tears even the moon looked
<pb n="267" xml:id="p291-267"/>

misty, and as the hour grew late he called for one of his
attendants, but for some time no one answered, so deserted was the
Palace. But a certain officer of the Palace Guard named <persName>Nanjo-no-Daihitsu Nakakuni</persName>, who happened to be on duty that night,
though in a remote part of the Palace, heard his master's voice
through the silent halls and made reply. Then the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
bade him come near, for he had something to ask,
whereupon <persName>Nakakuni</persName>, wondering what it could be, entered the
Imperial Chamber, and His Majesty enquired of him if he knew
where <persName>Kogo</persName> had hidden herself. "How should I know such a
thing?" replied the retainer. “I have heard that she is living
in a cottage with a single folding door somewhere near <placeName>Saga</placeName>,"
said the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, "but I do not know the name of the person
with whom she is staying. Do you think you could find her ? "
“If I do not know the name of the master of the house, how
can I find her?” replied <persName>Nakakuni</persName> in perplexity, whereat the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> in despair wept bitterly.
</p>
<p>
After some further thought <persName>Nakakuni</persName> remembered <persName>Kogo's</persName>
skill on the Koto and said to himself: "Ah, on a moonlight
night like this she will surely be thinking of His Majesty here in
the lonely Palace, and no doubt she will play on the Koto; now
when she played in the Palace I used to be the one to accompany
her on the flute, so none knows her playing as well as I, and if I
go round about all the houses in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Saga</placeName>,
why should I not find out where she is?" Then" he said
at last,
though I do not know in whose house she is lodging,
I will go and search for her in that part, but if I find her and
have no letter, perhaps I shall not be believed, so let Your
Majesty write one that I may take it with me." Then the <persName>Em-
peror</persName> gave him the letter and ordered him to take a horse from
the Palace Stables, and he started off at a gallop, whipping up
his horse under the clear light of the moon and singing as he
rode the verse that begins: "The mountain village where the
wild stag cries," feeling, no doubt, the pathos of the autumn
scenery of <placeName>Saga</placeName>. So he rode on, stopping his horse to listen
<pb n="268" xml:id="p292-268"/>

whenever he came to a cottage with a single folding door, and
wondering if the lady he sought was within, but no sound of
a Koto broke the silence. Then, wondering whether she had
perhaps retired to some temple, he went to all the temples in that
part, but still could find no trace of her. Thinking it better not
to return at all than to return without any tidings, he wondered
if there was anywhere he could flee to, but as every place near
was the Imperial Domain, there was nowhere that he could go
to hide himself. Thus perplexed and knowing not what to do,
he recollected that the temple of <placeName>Horinji</placeName> was not far away, and
thinking that perhaps <persName>Kogo</persName> might have gone thither to gaze at
the moonlight, he turned his horse in that direction. Then in a
hamlet among the pines near <placeName>Kameyama</placeName> faintly he heard the
sound of a Koto; straining his ears he was uncertain whether it
was not the blasts from the mountain-tops, or the soughing of
the wind in the pine-trees. Urging on his horse he rode on
further and became aware that the sounds were indeed those of
a Koto, and that they proceeded from a cottage with a single
folding door, and stopping to listen awhile he perceived that
without doubt the player was <persName>Kogo</persName>, and that the piece she was
playing was one called '<term>Sōfüren</term>,' which expresses the longing
felt by a wife for her absent husband. <persName>Nakakuni</persName> was touched
at her tender feeling for His Majesty that prompted her to select
this piece from the many that she played, and drawing his flute
from his girdle joined in the tune for a few bars, and then knocked
softly at the door. The music immediately ceased, whereupon
<persName>Nakakuni</persName> called out : "It is <persName>Nakakuni</persName> who has come from the
Palace with a message from the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> ;" but though he
knocked several times no one answered from within. After some time
there was a sound as of someone coming to the gate, and as he
stood there in joyful anticipation, the lock was unfastened, and
the gate opened a very little and disclosed only the face of a
beautiful young girl. "Have you not mistaken the house?"
she asked, "for a Palace Messenger can have no errand
here," whereat <persName>Nakakuni</persName>, since he feared that if he made
<pb n="269" xml:id="p293-269"/>

answer the gate would be shut and locked again, pushed it
open by force and entered. Standing on the verandah of the
house he told his story: "Why has she come to live in a place
like this? The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> is grieving for her absence and his
melancholy may endanger his life, and that it may not be
thought that I speak falsely, see, I have brought you a letter
written by His Majesty's own hand; " and he took out the letter
and handed it to her. The girl took it to <persName>Kogo</persName>, who opened
and read it, and found that it was indeed His Majesty's writing.
In a short while she had written an answer and sent it to <persName>Naka-
kuni</persName> with a lady's suit of Court dress as a present. On receiving
the answer he said: "Although perhaps I ought not to ask for
more than this letter, yet as I was specially sent hither by my
Lord, and am not unknown to your mistress, how can I return
without a message from her own lips?" Then <persName>Kogo</persName>,
consenting to his wish, came forth and excused herself saying:
"As you know, in fear of the threatening and angry words of the
<persName>Nyudo</persName>, I fled away secretly one night from the Palace, and as I
have been staying in a place like this I have not played the Koto
at all, but as I am going away to-morrow into the recesses of
<placeName>Ohara</placeName>, and this night is my last, the mistress of this house
persuaded me to play, saying that it was late and there would be
none to hear, and so I yielded, for the remembrance of former
days stirred within me and my fingers yearned for my beloved
instrument," and as she spoke her tears flowed freely, while
<persName>Nakakuni</persName> too hid his face in his sleeve. After a while <persName>Nakakuni</persName>
calmed his emotion and said: Doubtless your intention in
going into the recesses of <placeName>Ohara</placeName> is to become a nun; this, I
think, is not a proper thing to do, for how will the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> feel
about it? Nay, I can by no means allow it?" and turning to
his attendant he added; "See that this girl does not leave this
place;" and leaving him there to guard the house, he sprung
upon his horse and rode back again, reaching the Palace just as
the dawn was beginning to break.
</p>
<p>
Tying up his horse and throwing the lady's dress over the
<pb n="270" xml:id="p294-270"/>

Palace doors, he went toward the <placeName>Shishinden</placeName>, thinking that the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> would surely be sleeping by this time, and wondering
who to send to him, but as it happened His Majesty was still
sitting as he had left him the night before in melancholy
abstraction, as the Chinese poet says:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Soaring up to the southward and wheeling round to the northward,</l>
<l>Vainly in autumn the goose seeks for the heat or the cold;</l>
<l>Flying forth to the eastward and sweeping round to the westward,</l>
<l>Ever its lonely eye stares at the moon of the dawn."</l>
</lg>
<p>
So <persName>Nakakuni</persName> came and gave him the letter of <persName>Kogo</persName> and
reported all he had done. The <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> joy was extreme, and
he ordered him to go again that night and bring her back with
him. <persName>Nakakuni</persName>, though he feared the wrath of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> if he
should hear of it, yet as it was the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> order, borrowed
an ox-car from somebody and went down that night to <placeName>Saga</placeName>,
and although <persName>Kogo</persName> at first refused to accompany him, at last he
prevailed on her and brought her back to the Palace. There
she lived secretly in a remote chamber, and used to visit His
Majesty every night, so that in the course of time a Princess was
born to her, and this is the Princess who is known as <persName>Bomon-no-Nyoin</persName>. Then the matter came to the ears of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and he
was very angry, exclaiming : "Then it was all a lie that I was
told that <persName>Kogo</persName> had been got rid of; but at all events she shall
be removed now," and somehow or other they decoyed her
from the Palace and forced her to shave her head and become a
nun. She was then only twenty-three years old, and though
she had wished to retire from the world before, how sad a fate
was it to be compelled to do so in this peremptory manner,
and to put on black robes and go and live in the wilds of <placeName>Saga</placeName>.
It was these painful events that aggravated the illness of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> so that he died. The <persName>Ho-o</persName> had nothing but troubles,
one coming fast after the other.
<pb n="271" xml:id="p295-271"/>

In the period Ei-man his eldest son <persName>Nijo Tenno</persName> died, and
then in the seventh month of the second year of Angen his
grandson <persName>Kujo Tenno</persName> passed away. In the sky the <term>Hiyoku</term>,
and on earth the two branches that grow together are
proverbial for connubial affection, neither must we forget the Lover
stars by the <placeName>River of Heaven</placeName>. Not less deep was the affection
that existed between the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and his consort <persName>Kenshun-mon-in</persName>,
and one evening in autumn she fell sick and passed away with
the dew of the next morning; and though months and years
had gone by since then, it seemed to him like a parting of
yesday and his tears were not dry even now. Then in the fifth month
of the fourth year of Jisho his second son <persName>Prince Takakura</persName> was
killed, and now that the <persName>Emperor Takakura</persName>, on whom only he
could rely for help in this world and prayers in the next, had
died before him, he had no one left to turn to in his affliction,
but could only shed lonely tears. "The greatest grief to
which no other can compare is that of a father left behind
by his son in his old age, and the greatest regret above all others
is that of a child deprived of his parent in his youth," wrote the
Prime Minister <persName>Tomotsuna</persName> when his son <persName>Sumiakira</persName> pre-deceased
him. So, when the Empire and the Imperial Family suffered
such a bereavement, not only the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, who had acquired great
merit by his study of the <term>Hokke Sutra</term> as well as by his
admirable knowledge of the mysteries of the <term>Shingon</term>, but al
those who dwelt in the Palace, veiled their brocaded robes.

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>THE SENDING ROUND OF LETTERS.</head>
<p>But this <persName>Lay priest Chancellor</persName>, seeing the <persName>Ho-o</persName> thus
overwhelmed by his troubles and wishing to comfort him, sent
him a daughter that he had had by a certain <persName>Naiji</persName> of the
shrine of <placeName>Itsukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Aki</placeName>, a beautiful girl of eighteen, that
he might console himself with her; and as all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> as well
as the other <persName>Courtiers</persName> brought her to the Palace in state it was
<pb n="272" xml:id="p296-272"/>

quite as festive as the procession of an <persName>Emperor's Consort</persName>; but
as this took place twenty seven days after the death of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> everyone thought it most unseemly.
</p>
<p>
Now there was in <placeName>Shinano</placeName> a certain <persName>Minamoto</persName> called <persName>Kiso
Jiro Yoshinaka</persName>. He was the second son of the late <persName>Tatewaki
Senjo Yoshikata</persName>, and when his father was killed at <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>
on the twelfth day of the eighth month of the second year of
Kyuju by <persName>Akugenda Yoshihira</persName>, he was but a child of twò
years old. His mother, in her grief, fled with him to the
province of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> to <persName>Kiso Chuzo Kaneto</persName>, and begged him to
take the child and bring him up. So <persName>Kaneto</persName> granted her
request and took him and reared him, and now he had grown up
to be a young man, distinguished among all for his beauty and
noble bearing as well as for his matchless boldness and mighty
strength. So powerful and skilled in the use of all weapons of
war was he that people ranked him with the great warriors of
old, with <persName>Tamura Maru</persName>, <persName>Fujiwara Toshihito</persName>, <persName>Taira Koreshige</persName>,
<persName>Taira Muneyori</persName>, <persName>Fujiwara Yasumasa</persName>, and his own ancestors
<persName>Minamoto Yorimitsu</persName> and <persName>Yoshiie</persName>. At the age of thirteen when
his <term>Genpuku</term> took place he went to the shrine of <placeName>Hachiman</placeName> and
spent the night there as the custom was, and offering his queue
of hair before the god he prayed: "As my ancestor in the
fourth generation, <persName>Yoshiie Ason</persName>, became the son of this Deity
and was called <persName>Hachimantaro Yoshiie</persName>, so may I also follow in
his footsteps;" and he took the name of <persName>Kiso Jiro Yoshinaka</persName>.
</p>
<p>
As he often used to go up to the Capital with his
fosterfather he observed the proud behaviour of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and
meditated over it. So it happened that one day he said to
<persName>Kaneto</persName>: "I hear that <persName>Hyoe-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> has gone up
from the <placeName>Tokaido</placeName> with eight of the eastern provinces to smite
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>; now let me haste and join him with the men of the
<placeName>Tosando</placeName> and <placeName>Hokurikudo</placeName>, and when they are destroyed we
two will be the greatest leaders in all the land of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>."
When he heard this <persName>Kaneto</persName> was overjoyed : "It was for this "
he said "that I have brought you up these twenty years, and
<pb n="273" xml:id="p297-273"/>

when I hear you speak thus I know you will be a worthy scion
of <persName>Hachimantaro</persName>." Thus <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> started to stir up a
rebellion, and sent round letters instigating his neighbours to rise,
and, as in the province of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> <persName>Nei-no-Koyata</persName> and <persName>Shigeno-no-Yukichika</persName> were persuaded to support him, all the rest of the
warriors of that province came in on his side. The samurai of
the district of <placeName>Tago</placeName> in <placeName>Kozuke</placeName> also, because of their
good will to his father <persName>Yoshikata</persName>, hastened to offer themselves.
Thus it seemed that the hour of the doom of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had
come, and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> were about to accomplish their
longcherished desire.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6" xml:id="v6_ch6">
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>THE COURIERS.</head>
<p>Now <placeName>Kiso</placeName> was in the extreme south of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> on the
boundary of <placeName>Mino</placeName> and so was very near to the Capital, and
great fear came upon the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, for they wondered what they
should do now that the North had rebelled as well as the East.
But <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was not perturbed: "Even if all the men
of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> do follow <persName>Kiso</persName>," said he, "in <placeName>Echigo</placeName> there are the
two brothers <persName>Jo-no-Taro Sukenaga</persName> and <persName>Shiro Sukeshige</persName>, the
descendants of <persName>Taira Koreshige</persName>, who can muster no small force
between them, and if I give the order they will soon fall on
<persName>Kiso</persName> and destroy him." Some of his family were satisfied at
this, but others still maintained that the situation was critical.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of the second month an investiture-of
officials was held and <persName>Jo-no-Taro Sukenaga</persName> was appointed
Echigo-no-kami. This was done with a view to his attacking
<persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>. On the seventh day all the families of
the Ministers and Courtiers assembled and wrote out and
offered the <term>Sonjo Darani</term> and the <term>Fudo Darani</term>,
mostpotent litanies to overcome evil, by which they trusted to
subdue the revolt. On the ninth day news was brought that
<persName>Musashi-no-Gon-no-kami Nyudo Yoshimoto</persName>, of the district of
<pb n="274" xml:id="p298-274"/>

<placeName>Ishikawa</placeName> in <placeName>Kawachi</placeName>, with his son <persName>Ishikawa-no-Hangwan-dai
Yoshikane</persName> had renounced their allegiance to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and
were going down to the east to join the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. The <persName>Heike</persName>
Generals <persName>Gendaiyu-no-Hangwan Suesada</persName> and <persName>Setsu-no-Hangwan
Morizumi</persName> immediately set out against them with a force of three
thousand horse, and caught them in their stronghold with only
about a hundred retainers, and in the fight which ensued, lasting
from early morning to late at night, <persName>Yoshimoto</persName> was killed and
his son wounded and captured. On the eleventh day the head
of <persName>Yoshimoto</persName> was paraded through the streets of the Capital.
The precedent for exposing the head of a rebel during a time of
National Mourning was taken; from the time when, after the
death of <persName>Horikawa Tenno</persName>, the head of the former <persName>Tsushima-no-
kami Minamoto Yoshichika</persName> was thus treated.
</p>
<p>
On the twelfth day a courier came from <persName>Usa-no-Daiguji
Kinmichi</persName> of <placeName>Kyushu</placeName> with the news that all that country, from
<persName>Ogata Saburo Koreyoshi</persName> to the men of <placeName>Usuki</placeName>, <placeName>Hetsuki</placeName> and
<placeName>Matsuura</placeName>, had revolted and thrown in their lot with the <orgName>Genji</orgName>.
These tidings caused the greatest surprise and consternation
among the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, for now that the West Country had forsaken
them as well as the South and North, they were at a loss how to
act, and smote their palms with rage and perplexity. On the
sixteenth day another courier arrived from <placeName>Iyo</placeName> in <placeName>Shikoku</placeName>,
telling how that, since during the last winter <persName>Kono-no-Shiro
Michikiyo</persName> of that province had renounced his allegiance and
made common cause with the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, <persName>Nuka-no-Nyudo Saijaku</persName>
of <placeName>Bingo</placeName>, a strong adherent of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, had crossed over to
<placeName>Iyo</placeName> and attacked him in his strong-hold at <placeName>Takanao</placeName> on the.
boundary of <placeName>Dogo</placeName> and <placeName>Dozen</placeName>. In the fight <persName>Kono Michikiyo</persName>
had been killed, and his son <persName>Kono-no-Shiro Michinobu</persName> had fled
over the sea to <persName>Neta-no-Jiro</persName> of <placeName>Aki</placeName>, who was his uncle on
the mother's side, and stayed there awaiting an opportunity to
kill <persName>Saijaku</persName> and thus avenge his father's death.
</p>
<p>
After putting down this outbreak in <placeName>Shikoku</placeName>, <persName>Saijaku</persName>
crossed over to <placeName>Tomo</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Bingo</placeName> on the fifteenth day of
<pb n="275" xml:id="p299-275"/>

the first month of the new year, where he called together a
nuniber of singing girls and strumpets, and proceeded to make merry
and carouse with them. Then <persName>Kono-no-Shiro Michinobu</persName> took
with him a hundred men-at-armis, and suddenly burst in on him
as he was drinking and revelling, and though <persName>Saijaku</persName> had some
three hundred retainers, they were so surprised at this
unexpected attack that they lost their heads and were quickly shot or
cut down. <persName>Saijaku</persName> was thus taken alive and <persName>Michinobu</persName>
brought him back to <placeName>Takanao</placeName> in <placeName>Iyo</placeName>, where his father had
been slain, and there put him to death. And some said that
his head was sawn off and others that he was crucified. After
this the men of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> submitted to <persName>Michinobu</persName> and followed
him. Then too <persName>Tanso</persName>, <persName>Betto of Kumano</persName> in the province of
<placeName>Kii</placeName>, forgot his great obligations to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and suddenly
changed his front and went over to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. Thus did the
South and East Sea districts follow the example of the East and
North Country, and men's ears were assailed continually with
reports of fresh defections, and as these hordes of savage rebels
swarmed out on all sides like angry bees, and the dominion of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> began to totter, all serious people, even those outside
the ruling family, lamented at the gloomy prospect.

<head>DEATH OF THE NYUDO.</head>
<p>On the twenty third day a Council of Courtiers was
suddenly called at the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, the <placeName>Sento Gosho</placeName>, and
the former <persName>Udaisho Munemori</persName> addressed them thus:
"The
expedition we made into the <placeName>East Country</placeName> did not effect
anything very much, so now I myself should like to take command
and lead an army to chastize these rebels in the <placeName>Fast</placeName> and
<placeName>North</placeName>." This bold speech was received with applause by all
the rest, and they praised <persName>Munemori</persName> for his decisive action; the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> too seemed quite delighted, and everyone who had the
least experience of martial exercises, even though he might be
<pb n="276" xml:id="p300-276"/>

a <persName>Courtier</persName> or <persName>Noble</persName>, declared himself ready to follow <persName>Mune-
mori</persName>, On the twenty seventh day they intended to set out,
but as <persName>Kiyomori</persName> had been taken ill during the night they did
not move. On the twenty eighth day it was reported that his
condition was grave, and all <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and the Capital was in
an uproar, every one running about and whispering together.
From the day that the <persName>Nyudo</persName> was taken ill he could not drink
even hot water, and the heat of his body was like a burning
fire, so that if any one came within eight or ten yards of him the
heat was unbearable. All he could do was to mutter 'Ata!
Ata!' (Hot! Hot!): it was a most extraordinary 'sickness.
To relieve him somewhat they brought water from the well of
<placeName>Senshuin</placeName> on <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> and filled a stone tank with it, into which
they lowered him, but the water began to bubble and boil and
immediately became like a hot bath. When water was poured
on him from a pipe, it flew off again hissing in clouds of steam
and spray, as though it had struck red-hot iron or stone, and
the water that did strike him burst into flames so that the
whole chamber was filled with whirling fires and thick black
smoke. It must have been just such a sight that <persName>Hogyo Sozu</persName>
saw formerly when he entreated <persName>Emma</persName>, the King of Hades, to
show him the place where his mother was; for <persName>Emma</persName>, moved
by his prayers, sent his jailers to guide him to the <placeName>Shonetsu
Hell</placeName>, and when he had passed through the iron gate he saw
the flames shooting up like meteors, thousands of miles high.
</p>
<p>
Moreover the wife of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, <persName>Hachijo-no-Nii-dono</persName>, had
a terrible dream. She dreamed that a flaming chariot entered.
the gate of her mansion without any driver, and in front and:
behind it stood two creatures, one with the head of an ox and
the other with that of a horse, while on the front of the chariot
appeared an iron tablet inscribed with the single character <term>MU</term>,
signifying Not. The <persName>Nii-dono</persName>, in her dream, asked whither it
had come, and the answer was: "Because the evil Karma of
the <persName>Priestly Chancellor</persName> of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> is so great, this chariot has
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><term>Mu</term>. First syllable of, mugen, without intermission.</note>
<p><pb n="277" xml:id="p301-277"/>

come to fetch him from the Palace of <persName>Emma-O</persName> the Dread King."
"Then," said she, "what is the meaning of that tablet?"
'Because of the crime of the burning of the great bronze image
of <persName>Vairochana</persName> a hundred and sixty feet high, it has been decreed
at the tribunal of <persName>Emma-O</persName> that he shall go down to the <placeName>Avichi
Hell</placeName>, the hottest of the hot hells where rebirth is unceasing, and
so it is that the character Not has been written: but the character
signifying 'Cease' has not yet been written." Then the <persName>Nii-dono</persName>
awoke, bathed in a cold sweat; and when she told what she had
seen, the hair of all that heard it stood up with affright. Then
they hastened to offer gold and silver and all manner of precious
things to the shrines and temples of the gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName>, and
fetched thither their horses and saddles and armour and swords
and bows and arrows, and prayed with might and main, but no
-sign was vouchsafed them; and the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and their wives
assembled around the bed of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> and mourned and
lamented bitterly.
</p>
<p>
On the second day of the second month, this year being
leap-year, the <persName>Nii-dono</persName> came to the bedside of the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, in
spite of the intensity of the heat, and said; "Though my visits
to enquire about you every day may seem few, yet perchance,
while still you are able, you may tell me of something that
you desire." Then <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, though his sufferings were
so great, summoned up his fast-failing strength and said in a
weak voice: "Since the time of Hogen and Heiji my unworthy
house subdued the enemies of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> many times and
thereby gained great rewards, for which we are most grateful,
and I, having been permitted to become the maternal relation of
the <persName>Heavenly Sovereign</persName> and to reach the office of <persName>Dajodaijin</persName>,
am about to hand down my glory to my descendants, wherefore
in this world I have nothing else left to desire. The only thing
I have to regret is that I cannot see the head of <persName>Hyoye-no-suke
Yoritomo</persName>. When I am dead do not perform any Buddhist
services or make offerings for me, or build temples or pagodas;
only make haste and slay <persName>Yoritomo</persName> and cut off his head and lay
<pb n="278" xml:id="p302-278"/>

it before my tomb. That will be the best offering you can make
me either in this world or the next." So deep indeed was his
guilt. Then they put water on a board and rolled him on it to
ease him, but it did no good, and on the fourth day of the same
month he at last expired in great anguish. When it was known
the commotion and galloping to and fro of horses and carriages
was such as to make the sky echo and the earth tremble. Even
if he had been the <persName>Heavenly Sovereign</persName>, the Lord of ten thousand
chariots, it could hardly have been greater.
</p>
<p>
He was sixty-four years old this year. He cannot be said
to have died of old age, for when the result of man's Karma
comes upon him the most potent Sutras have no efficacy, nor
can the power of the gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName> avail anything; yea, all
the deities of heaven cannot protect him, so what can ordinary
men do? Even if tens of thousands of loyal warriors, all willing
to lay down their lives for him, were ranged around both above
and below, they could not fight with the unseen and invulnerable
powers of the underworld.
And so alone and without a
companion he must go down to the <placeName>Yellow Springs of Death</placeName>, across
the <placeName>Sanzu-no-kawa</placeName>, the river of Hades, and ascend the <placeName>Mountain
of Shide</placeName> whence no traveller returns. And the evil Karma
that he has made will take shape as the jailers that come to nect
him.
</p>
<p>
And so, as it must be, on the seventh day his funeral pyre
was lighted at <placeName>Otaki</placeName>, and <persName>Enjitsu Hogen</persName> took his bones and
brought them down to the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, where they were
deposited at <placeName>Kyogashima</placeName>. Thus though he wielded such great
authority that his name was feared through the whole Empire,
his body rose up in smoke to the sky of <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, and his bones
mingled with the sand of the shore.

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>KYONOSHIMA.</head>
<p>After the funeral of <persName>Kiyomori</persName> a strange thing happened.
His Palace of <placeName>Nishi-Hachijo</placeName> with all its splendid adornment of
precious stones and fretted work of gold and silver suddenly
went up in flames the same night; and though it was no
uncommon thing for houses to catch fire, it was rumoured that it
was the work of incendiaries. Also on the south side of
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> there was heard the sound as of some twenty or
thirty men, if they were men, dancing and singing the refrain:
"Hurrah! the water! Hark to the sound of the waterfall!
mingled with bursts of uncanny laughter. As the <persName>Retired
Emperor</persName> had passed away in the first month of this year and
the Empire had been plunged into mourning, and now within
scarcely a month or so the <persName>Nyudo</persName> had died also, even the
common people without understanding were overcome with
apprehension and gloom. Some of the bold spirits among the
<persName>Heike</persName> retainers, declaring these strange occurrences to be the
work of <term>Tengu</term>, set out in a band of about a hundred to
investigate this weird laughter, and found that it proceeded
from the <placeName>Hojujiden</placeName>, the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. As the <persName>Ho-o</persName> had
not been in residence there for some three years, a certain
<persName>Motomune</persName>, former Governor of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, had been sent there to
look after it, and some of his friends had repaired thither that
night, bringing liquor with them to carouse on the sly, and
although they started their banquet with the intention of
making no noise, seeing the nature of the occasion, yet before
long they all became drunken, so that their discretion forsook
<pb n="2" xml:id="p16-2"/>

them, and they began to sing and dance without restraint.
When the <orgName>Heike</orgName> samurai perceived this they rushed in on them
and seized and bound the whole twenty or thirty of them,
inebriated as they were, and brought them into the courtyard
of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. Then the former <persName>Udaisho Munemori</persName> came
out on to the verandah, and they related the whole matter
in detail, but he only said: "There seems no need to execute
a lot of drunkards like this," and dismissed them.
</p>
<p>
It was the custom for all, high and low, to have the bell
rung after a death, and the proper prayers and offerings
made at stated hours, but after this Lay-priest died no one
made the least offering either to priests or <persName>Buddhas</persName>, but all
were occupied day and night with nothing but preparations for
war. The painful manner of his death too was repulsive,
but this also inclined many to think that he was not as
other men. When his family went to the Shrine of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName>
accompanied by all the other families of Court Nobles, people
used to say how much grander was the procession than that of
the Kwampaku when he went to worship at his family shrine of
<placeName>Kasuga</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Concerning the making of the island called <placeName>Kyonoshima</placeName> at
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>; it was a very successful undertaking, for even unto
this day all kinds of vessels are able to enter the harbour
without mishap. The work was begun in the early days of the
second month of the first year of the period Oho, but on the
second day of the eighth month a great tempest suddenly rose
and the mighty waves swept it all away. Then toward the end
of the third month of the third year <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu-no-Kyo</persName>
was entrusted with the work of rebuilding it, and a Council of
Courtiers was held to consider the question of following the
ancient custom of exposing someone in the sea as a sacrifice to
the sea-gods, but they decided that such a wicked thing should
not be done, and so texts from the Holy Sutras were cut on
the face of the stones instead, and this is why it is called
<placeName>Kyonoshima</placeName> (Sutra Island).

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIEST JISHIN.</head>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><persName>Jie Sojo</persName>. A famous priest who became Tendai Zasshu. Died in the third
year of Ei-kwan (985). Also called <persName>Ryogen</persName>.</note>
<p>It was said, as has been related, that <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was not an
ordinary man at all, and it was rumoured that he was an
incarnation of <persName>Jie Sojo</persName>. The reason for this was the following
story. In the temple of <placeName>Seichoji</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName> there
lived a certain saintly monk named <persName>Jishin Bo Sonei</persName>. He had
formerly been attached to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, where for many years he
had meditated on the <title>Hokke Sutra</title>, but at last his religious zeal
drove him to leave that mountain and come and live in this
temple, so that all believed on him and were converted.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty second day of the twelfth month of the
period Shoan, <persName>Sonei</persName> went as usual to the altar of Buddha to
perform the evening service, and was sitting supported by his
arm-rest reading the <title>Hokke Sutra</title>, when, it seemed neither in a
dream or reality, there entered two men clad in white Kariginu
and Eboshi and wearing leggings and straw sandals, carrying
an open letter. When <persName>Sonei</persName>, as in a dream, asked them from
whom they had brought it, they replied: "From the Court
of <persName>Emma-O</persName>," whereupon he received it from their hands and
opening it read as follows: "To the Priest <persName>Jishin Bo Sonei</persName>,
residing in the temple of <placeName>Seichoji</placeName>, in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, in
the Country of <placeName>Dai-Nihon</placeName> which is in the <placeName>Djambudvipa</placeName>. On
the twenty sixth day at the Palace of <persName>Emma Raja</persName> there will be
held a recitation of the ten myriad portions of the <title>Hokke Sutra</title>,
and ten myriad priests from' ten myriad countries will be
entertained. As you have been included in the number do you
proceed hither as appointed. The above given at his Court,
at the command of <persName>Emma-O</persName>. Twenty second day of the
twelfth month of the second year of Shoan."
</p>
<p>
As <persName>Sonei</persName> could by no means refuse the dread command,
<pb n="4" xml:id="p18-4"/>

he wrote an acknowledgement, after which he awoke, and when
he related the vision to <persName>Ko-ei</persName>, the chief priest of the temple, the
hair of all that heard it stood up with affright. Thinking that
his end was near he gave himself up to prayer, repeating the
<term>Nembutsu</term> continually, and trusting that <persName>Buddha</persName> would have
compassion on him and receive him into his <placeName>Paradise</placeName>. On the
twenty fifth day he went as usual to the altar of <persName>Buddha</persName> and
recited the <title>Sutras</title>, and at the hour of the Rat (12. p.m.),
feeling sleepy, he returned to his room and lay down to rest. At
the hour of the Ox, (2. a.m) the two men came again and
urged him to start with them, but when <persName>Sonei</persName> was preparing to
go, he found that he had no proper garments or begging-bowl.
While he was wondering what was to be done, for it would be
a dreadful thing to disobey the mandate of <persName>Emma-O</persName>, a priest's
robe suddenly wrapped itself round his body, while a
beggingbowl of gold descended from heaven into his hand; at the same
time two attendant priests, two acolytes and ten lower priests
appeared before his apartment with a chariot adorned with the
seven precious things. <persName>Sonei</persName> joyfully mounted the chariot,
which soared away through the sky toward the north west and
soon reached the Palace of <persName>Emma</persName>. Around it spread on all
sides an immense courtyard, and the vastness of its spaces
within was indescribable. The Palace buildings were all of
gold and jewels, and shone with a brightness scarcely to be
borne by mortal eyes. The service of that day had already
been finished and the priests had all departed, so <persName>Sonei</persName> stood
waiting in the middle gate on the south side of the Palace,
viewing the buildings from far off. While he stood thus, all the
officials and attendants of <persName>Emma's</persName> realm came to make their
obeisance to the Dread King in a procession of extraordinary
magnificence, and <persName>Sonei</persName>, wishing to enquire about his sins and
his future life, proceeded in the same direction. As he did so
the ten attendants formed into line and the two priests carried
boxes, while the acolytes held up an umbrella over him, and in
this way they approached the presence of <persName>Emma</persName>; whereupon
<pb n="5" xml:id="p19-5"/>

the King and all his officials and Courtiers rose up to greet
them, for the two priests now appeared in their real form as
<persName>Yakuo Bosatsu</persName> and <persName>Yusei Bosatsu</persName>, and the two acolytes as
<persName>Tamonten</persName> and <persName>Jikokuten</persName>, the ten attendants being
metamorphosed into ten female demons who ministered to him. "Why
have you come thus when all the other priests have
departed?" asked <persName>Emma</persName> From my childhood," replied
<persName>Sonei</persName>, "I have never neglected daily to recite the <title>Hokke
Sutra</title>, but even so I am not sure of my fate in the after life, so
i is of that that I wish to enquire. "Rebirth in <placeName>Paradise</placeName>,"
answered <persName>Emma</persName>, "is granted according to faith, but the
<title>Hokke Sutra</title> is the straight way for man to attain Buddhahood,
for which purpose all the <persName>Buddhas</persName> of the <placeName>Three Worlds</placeName>
appeared on this earth. The merit of earnest faith and
understanding of it is greater than that of practise of the <term>Five
Paramitas</term>, while the virtue of preaching it five times is more
potent than eighty years charity. According to your
abounding merit you will be reborn into the highest circle of the
<placeName>Tuchita heaven</placeName>." Then, turning to an attendant, the Dread
King said; "The deeds of this man's life are in the casket of
good works; go and fetch them, and show him what is
written." Then the ministering demon went to the store-house
on the south side and brought the casket, and when he opened
it and read what was written therein, every act and every
thought that he had done or meditated in his whole life was
revealed; not one was lacking. "One request only I have to
make," said <persName>Sonei</persName>, bursting into tears, show me, I beseech
thee, the way by which I may escape from the endless circle of
births and deaths, and attain to the highest state of Enlighten-
ment." So, as he ceased not from his tears, <persName>Emma</persName>, moved by
compassion, instructed him in these sacred words of doctrine:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Wife and child and kindred, rank and wealth,</l>
<l>Accompany no mortal after death,</l>
<l>But devils formed from the ill deeds he did,</l>
<l>Torment him that he scream for evermore."</l>
</lg>
<p>
<pb n="6" xml:id="p20-6"/>

<persName>Sonei</persName> was exceedingly rejoiced and said: "In the country
of <placeName>Dai-Nihon</placeName> in the <placeName>Djambudvipa</placeName>, at <placeName>Wadamisaki</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, the Lord High Chancellor of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
has built cells extending over a distance of ten cho square, and
invited many priests to come and recite the <title>Sutras</title> and pray
earnestly, even as it might be at the meeting of today."
On hearing this, <persName>Emma</persName> in great admiration and gladness
exclaimed: “That <persName>Nyudo</persName> is no ordinary person; he is the
reincarnation of <persName>Jie Sojo</persName>, and it was because he kept the law of
Tendai Buddhism that for a while he was born again in <placeName>Japan</placeName>.
Three times a day we pray for him here in these words which
you will remember to repeat to the <persName>Nyudo</persName>.
</p>
<lg>
<l>"<persName>Jie Dai-Sojo</persName> greatly we revere,</l>
<l>Protector of the Tendai Buddhist Law.</l>
<l>Revealed on earth as the Great Chancellor,</l>
<l>His evil Karma even will help mankind."</l>
</lg>
<p>
So, being entrusted with these holy words, <persName>Sonei</persName> went out
from the presence of the <persName>King of the Underworld</persName>, weeping
tears of joy, and when he came to the middle gate of the south
side, his ten priestly attendants again brought the chariot and
soared away with him toward the south-west, so that he seemed
to have returned in the twinkling of an eye, whereupon he
awoke as from a dream. Afterwards, going up to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, he
went to the mansion of the <persName>Nyudo</persName> at <placeName>Nishi-Hachijo</placeName> and told
him all that he had seen. <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was greatly rejoiced, and
after entertaining him royally, sent him away with many
presents, beside raising him to the rank of <term>Risshi</term>. And this is
how it came to pass that all knew that the <persName>Nyudo</persName> was the
reincarnation of <persName>Jie Sojo</persName>. <persName>Jikyo Shonin</persName> was also the
reincarnation of <persName>Kobo Daishi</persName>, while the <persName>Retired Emperor Shirakawa</persName>
was the reincarnation of <persName>Jikyo Shonin</persName>. This Emperor
accumulated many meritorious actions and piled up many virtuous
deeds, and in this degenerate age also <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, as the
reincarnation of <persName>Jie Sojo</persName>, both by his evil deeds and his virtuous
actions acquired great merit, and thus conferred much benefit
<pb n="7" xml:id="p21-7"/>

on himself and mankind. Not otherwise was it that <persName>S'akya
Muni</persName> and <persName>Devadatta</persName> both greatly helped the world of men.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10" xml:id="v6_ch10">
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>THE IMPERIAL CONSORT OF GION.</head>
<p>But the old men who remembered the former days said
that <persName>Kiyomori</persName> was not as other men because he was really the
son of the <persName>Emperor Shirakawa</persName>. And the reason was this. In
the period Eikyu there was a lady, who was much beloved by
the Emperor, who lived near <placeName>Gion</placeName> at the foot of <placeName>Higashiyama</placeName>,
so that she was known as <persName>Gion-no-Nyogo</persName>; and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
used to visit her there continually.
</p>
<p>
One evening, it was the twentieth day of the fifth month,
His Majesty went to see her privately, attended only by one or
two Courtiers and a few Palace Guards. As it was the season
of heavy rain the night was dark and gloomy, and no moon
shone through the clouds. Now there was a temple near the
house where the lady was living, and as they approached it
they saw something that shone strangely come forth from the
side of the buildings. Its head seemed to be covered with
needles of burnished silver that glittered as they stood erect,
while in one hand it carried what looked like a hammer, and in
the other a shining object. The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and Courtiers were
panic-stricken; "See," they cried, "it is without doubt a
demon! They always carry a hammer in their hand! What is
to be done? At this time <persName>Tadamori</persName>, the father of <persName>Kiyomori</persName>,
was there as one of the lower Palace Guards, and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
called him and said; "You are the boldest of all my
attendants; go shoot that thing to death or cut it down before
it falls upon us."
<persName>Tadamori</persName> immediately advanced towards
the creature in obedience to the Imperial Command, but when
he considered it closely it did not seem such a terrible object.
"If it is nothing but a fox or a badger I should look rather a
stupid fellow if I shot at it or cut it down," he thought, so he
<pb n="8" xml:id="p22-8"/>

determined to take it alive if possible. As he crept nearer he
noticed that the light flashed and then went out intermittently,
and after watching this two or three times he sprang upon it
and grappled with it. Immediately a voice cried out in alarm,
and he found that it was no monster but a man.
</p>
<p>
Then they all kindled lights and looked, and found that it
was a priest about sixty years old, whose business it was to
look after the temple, and he was going to light the lamps
before the Buddhas, so he carried in one hand a vessel of oil
and in the other an earthenware lamp, and as the rain was
falling heavily he had thrown a kind of cape made of wheat
straw over his head, and it was this that glittered in the light
and had the appearance as of steel needles.
</p>
<p>
Thus when they discovered this, they perceived how
foolish it would have been to have shot or drawn sword
on him, and the conduct of <persName>Tadamori</persName> was proved to have been
most reasonable and prudent. "How gentle can a samurai be
on occasion;" said His Majesty, and as a reward he bestowed
on him the lady of <placeName>Gion</placeName> whom he so greatly loved. Now the
lady was at this time pregnant, and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> said; "If it
be a girl that is born, I myself will take it, but if it be a boy,
then it shall be given to <persName>Tadamori</persName> and be educated as a
samurai." In due time the lady gave birth to a son, and
though nothing was said about it in public they treasured him
with the greatest care. <persName>Tadamori</persName> greatly wished to report the
matter to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, but could not find a suitable
opportunity. After a while, however, when His Majesty was on his
way to the Shrine of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, it chanced that the Imperial
Palanquin was set down at a place called <placeName>Itogasaka</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Kii</placeName> that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> might rest, when <persName>Tadamori</persName>
gathered some shoots of '<term>Nukago</term>' that was growing profusely
in the bamboo thicket, put them into his sleeve and showed
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><term>Nukago</term>. Or <term>Mukago</term>; a kind of <term>yama-imo</term> or <term>yam</term>. <term>Aceras angustifolia</term>.
(<persName>Brinkley</persName>) There is a word-play here on another meaning of <term>imo</term>, sister or lover.
Cf. the words of the verse <term>Imo ga ko wa hau hodo ni koso nari ni keri</term>.'</note>
<p><pb n="9" xml:id="p23-9"/>

them to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> with an obeisance, at the same time
reciting this line:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"See this plant that creeps and crawls like a child in the woodland;</l>
</lg>
<p>
Immediately His Majesty, understanding the reference,
added the second line of the couplet, thus:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Then let <persName>Tadamori</persName> cherish and nurture it so."</l>
</lg>
<p>
So he brought him up as his own child. The <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
happening to hear that the baby cried very much at night
made another stanza and sent it to <persName>Tadamori</persName>.
</p>
<lg>
<l>"If he cries at night you have only to get up and nurse him,</l>
<l>In the future age, pure and successful he'll shine."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Whereupon they gave him the name <persName>Kiyomori</persName> or Pure.
Success.
</p>
<p>
When he was twelve years old he came of age, and was
appointed Hyoye-no-suke, and at the age of eighteen he was
promoted to the third rank, so that people who did not know
these things said; "Indeed! he is treated like the son of a
great noble," whereat the <persName>Emperor Toba</persName>, who was aware of
his origin replied: "He is inferior to none of the noble
families."
</p>
<p>
In former ages too, <persName>Tenchi Tenno</persName> presented one of his
consorts who was in the same condition to the <persName>Taishokkwan
Kamatari</persName>, telling him that he would adopt the child if it were a
girl, but that if a boy were born the Minister should bring it
up; and a boy was born who eventually became <persName>Joei Kwasho</persName>
the founder of the temple of <placeName>Tabu-no-Mine</placeName>. Considering this
precedent in ancient days, so in these latter days also it was not
strange that <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, being really the son of the <persName>Emperor
Shirakawa</persName>, should plan such great political changes as the
change of capital.

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>THE BATTLE OF SUNOMATA.</head>
<p>On the twentieth day of the same month <persName>Gojo-no-Dainagon
Kunitsuna Kyo</persName> departed this life, He had been on particularly
intimate terms of friendship with the <persName>Nyudo</persName>, so that it was
strange that he should have been taken ill on the same day,
and have died in the same month. On the twenty second day
<persName>Munemori</persName> paid a visit to the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and informed him that his
Palace was to be moved back to the <placeName>Hojujiden</placeName>. This Palace
had been built on the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the
first year of Oho, and His Majesty had personally directed the
laying out of the gardens with landscapes of trees and hills and
ornamental water according to his taste, as well as having new
shrines constructed near it to the deities of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> and
<placeName>Kumano</placeName>. In consequence of the ill-treatment of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>,
however, he had not lived there for the last few years, and so
it had fallen into disrepair, so now they proposed to have it put
into order before he returned there to reside. But the <persName>Ho-o</persName>
was so pleased at the thought of going there again that he did
not wish to wait for this, and insisted on moving immediately. He
at once went to see the apartments of his late consort <persName>Kenshun-
mon-in</persName>, and found that in this short time the pine-tree by the
bank and the willow that grew by the edge of the lake had
both become quite big trees; and when he looked at the mallow
tree by the pond, and the willow at the palace eaves, that stood
opposite to them, the remembrance of old times overcame him
so that he was affected to tears.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of the third month all the priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName>
were pardoned and restored to their offices, and a proclamation
was made that they should be confirmed in the possession oí
their tributary temples and manors as before. On the third
day was held the ceremony of inauguration of the rebuilding of
the <placeName>Dai-Butsuden</placeName>, and the former <persName>Sashoben Yukitaka</persName> was
appointed to direct it. This <persName>Yukitaka</persName> had made a pilgrimage
</p>
<p><pb n="11" xml:id="p25-11"/>

<placeName>Yahata</placeName> the year before and spent the night praying in the
shrine, where he had a dream in which he saw the doors of the
inner sanctuary open and an angelic messenger with hair tightly
bound up come forth and announce: "I am the messenger of
<persName>Hachiman Dai-Bosatsu</persName>; when you go to direct the inauguration
of the rebuilding of the <placeName>Dai-Butsuden</placeName> take this with you;
and he handed him a Courtier's baton. Afterwards when he
awoke he found the baton by his pillow, whereat he was greatly
astonished, wondering what was likely to happen that he should
have to undertake such an office, but as it was a supernatural
dream he put the baton in his bosom and took it home with
him, where he put it away most carefully. Soon after it came
to pass that the temples of <placeName>Nara</placeName> were burnt through the
wickedness of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and <persName>Yukitaka</persName> had the good fortune
to be chosen from many officials of the same rank to preside at
the inauguration of their rebuilding: a most auspicious
connexion for him.
</p>
<p>
On the tenth day the governor of the province of <placeName>Mino</placeName>
rode hard to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> with the news that the <orgName>Genji</orgName> had pressed
their attack as for as the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName>, where they had
blocked the roads so that none could pass, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> chiefs
determined to set out against them. The Commander-in-chief
on this occasion was <persName>Sahyoye-no-kami Tomomori</persName>, and with
him were <persName>Sachujo Kiyotsune</persName>, <persName>Shosho Arimori</persName> and <persName>Tango-no-Jiju Tadafusa</persName>, while in command of the samurai were <persName>Etchu-no-Jirohyoye Moritsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorohyoye Tadamitsu</persName> and
<persName>Akushichihyoye Kagekiyo</persName>, and these marched against <placeName>Owari</placeName>
with a force of some thirty thousand horsemen
As it was
only about fifty days since <persName>Kiyomori</persName> died, everything was in a
sad state of confusion. On the side of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> <persName>Juro-no-Kurando Yukiie</persName> with <persName>Yoritomo's</persName> younger brother <persName>Gien</persName> and
about six thousand horsemen pitched camp by the <placeName>Owari</placeName> river,
so that both armies faced each other on opposite sides of the
stream. Then, during the night of the sixteenth day the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
force crossed over and made a sudden assault with the intention
<pb n="12" xml:id="p26-12"/>

of taking the <orgName>Heike</orgName> by surprise, but the latter, quite undis-.
mayed, allowed them to penetrate deeply with their small force,
and then closed in and surrounded them, and as they were all
dripping with water after fording the river this served to
distinguish friend from foe. The fight began at the hour of the
Tiger (4. a.m.) and continued till day broke, when <persName>Juro-no-Kurando Yukiie</persName>, finding that <persName>Gien</persName> had met his death among
the foe, and that most of his retainers too had fallen, after
fighting bravely gave way and fled back eastward of the river.
Then the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, crossing the river in their turn, took the
remnant of the enemy in the rear and shot them down from
behind, so that, though a few here and there stood on the
defensive and made some resistance, in a short time the whole
force was destroyed. All condemned this attack of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
as foolish, and contravening the well-known maxim, "Never
fight with water or swamp behind you." <persName>Yukiie</persName> fled to the
province of <placeName>Mikawa</placeName> where he destroyed the bridge over the
<placeName>Yahagigawa</placeName>, and threw up a breastwork of shields on the
further side in an effort to hold the enemy, but the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
pursued him vigorously and dislodged him. Thus keeping up
the pursuit, the men of <placeName>Mikawa</placeName> and <placeName>Totomi</placeName> would certainly
have come in on the side of the victors, when at this juncture
the Commander <persName>Sahyoye-no-kami Tomomori</persName> fell sick and
retired with his army to the Capital. As he had only driven
the enemy out of one position and had not been able to
complete the destruction of the remainder, he could not be said
to have done great things.
</p>
<p>
Now since <persName>Komatsu Shigemori</persName> had died the year before
last, and the <persName>Nyudo Kiyomori</persName> this year, it appeared to all that
the doom of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house was drawing on apace, and so
there were few who would support them except those whose
fortunes had been linked with theirs for many years, while in
the eastern provinces even the grass and trees inclined to the
will of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>.

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>THE HOARSE VOICE.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Jo-no-Taro Sukenaga</persName> of the province of <placeName>Echigo</placeName> had
been appointed Echigo-no-kami, and out of gratitude for the
Imperial Favour he set out with an army of thirty thousand
horse to the province of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> to attack <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>.
On the fifteenth day of the sixth month he was to start, but
about the middle of the night before, the sky suddenly clouded
over, and there was a mighty clap of thunder and a great
downpour of rain, and then, when the heavens had cleared, a
hoarse voice shouted in terrific accents from mid-air: "Here is
a supporter of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> who burned the copper-gilt image of
<persName>Vairochana Buddha</persName> a hundred and fifty feet high, that was in
the <placeName>Djambudvipa</placeName>; go ye and seize him!" At this fearful
portent the hair of <persName>Jo-no-Taro</persName> and his men stood on end with
terror, and some of the retainers exclaimed; "How can we go
on against this sign from Heaven?" But as it was not the
way of samurai to heed such things, they set forth, and had
only gone about the distance of twenty cho when a mass of
black clouds appeared, and hung over the head of <persName>Sukenaga</persName>
and covered him, and immediately his limbs were cramped and
his brain was palsied, so that he fell from his horse.
His men
took him up and carried him in a palanquin to his mansion,
where he lay prostrate for about three hours and then expired.
When a messenger was sent with the news to the Capital the
<persName>Heike</persName> were struck with consternation.
</p>
<p>
On the fourteenth day of the seventh month the name of
the era was changed to Yo-wa. On this day also an investiture
of officials was held, and <persName>Chikugo-no-kami Sadayoshi</persName> was
appointed Higo-no-kami, receiving jurisdiction over both the
provinces of <placeName>Chikuzen</placeName> and <placeName>Higo</placeName>, and being ordered to quell
the insurrection in <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, he set out thither wlth a force of
three thousand horse. A great amnesty was also proclaimed
on the same day, and all those who had been exiled in the third
<pb n="14" xml:id="p28-14"/>

year of Jisho were recalled to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>. The former <persName>Kwampaku
Matsu-dono</persName> came back from <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, the <persName>Dajo-daijin Myo-on-in</persName>
from <placeName>Owari</placeName>, while <persName>Azechi-no-Dainagon Sukekata-no-Kyo</persName>
hurried back from <placeName>Shinano</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty eighth day <persName>Myo-on-in Dono</persName> had an
audience with the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. When he was recalled in the era of
Chokwan he took his biwa and played in the Imperial verandah
the pieces called <term>Gao-on</term> and <term>Kenjo-raku</term>, and now when he
returned again in the period Yo-wa he played that called <term>Shufu-
aku</term> in the <placeName>Sento Palace</placeName>, for he had always that happy and
tactful delicacy of feeling that prompted him to do an elegant
thing at the proper time. On the same day <persName>Azechi-no-Dainagon Sukekata-no-Kyo</persName> also went to the Palace of the
<persName>Ho-o</persName>, and His Majesty asked him to sing, saying that, as he
had been living for some time in an uncongenial and remote
country place, he had no doubt forgotten all his popular ditties,
so perhaps he would sing an Imayo. Then the <persName>Dainagon</persName> sang
the Imayo verse beginning: "There's a river in <placeName>Shinano</placeName> called
<placeName>Kisojigawa</placeName>, 'tis said," and this apposite song 'gained him a
great reputation for wit, seeing that he must have seen and
heard of this river so often.

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>THE BATTLE OF YOKOTAGAWARA.</head>
<p>On the seventh day of the eighth month a recitation of the
<title>Nio Sutra</title> was held in the Hall of the <placeName>Dajokwan</placeName> in memory of
the subduing of <persName>Taira Masakado</persName>, and on the first day of the
ninth month a suit of armour and a helmet was presented to the
<placeName>Daijingu Shrine</placeName> at <placeName>Ise</placeName> in memory of the quelling of the
insurrection of <persName>Fujiwara Sumitomo</persName>. The Imperial Envoy to the
Shrine, <persName>Saishu-no-Jingi-no-Gondai-fuku Onakatomi Sadataka</persName>,
fell ill at <placeName>Koga</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Omi</placeName> soon after leaving
<placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, and on the third day he passed away in the <placeName>Detached
Palace</placeName> at <placeName>Ise</placeName>. Moreover they held a recitation of the <title>Sutras</title>
<pb n="15" xml:id="p29-15"/>

before the Five Great Buddhist Deities to pray for victory over
their enemies, and one of the priests called <persName>Dai-Ajari</persName>, who was
officiating before the image of <persName>Gosanze</persName>, became unconscious
and died before the altar. It was a manifest sign that neither
the gods nor <persName>Buddhas</persName> would accept their supplications.
</p>
<p>
Again, a service was held before the image of <persName>Daigen Myo-o</persName>,
and <persName>Jikken Ajari</persName> of the <placeName>Anjoji</placeName> came and brought many
volumes of the <title>Holy Sutras</title> and opened and read them, but all
he could prophesy was the downfall of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. When they
asked him the reason he replied: The enemies of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> must be subdued, and when we consider the present
condition of affairs, it appears that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> are the enemies of
the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, therefore they must be overthrown." On
account of this ominous prediction they proposed to put the
<persName>Ajari</persName> to death or banish him, but as everyone was so busy
with things both great and small, it happened that he escaped.
After the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had fallen and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> had taken their place,
this priest went down to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> and told his story there,
whereupon <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was pleased to raise him to the rank of
Sojo as a reward for his boldness.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty fourth day of the twelfth month the Consort
of the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName> became a nun and took the title of <persName>Kenrei-
mon-in</persName>, and as the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was quite an infant at the time,
this was the only name by which he ever knew her. And so
this year came to an end and the second year of Yo-wa began.
</p>
<p>
The Court Festivals of the New Year were held as usual. On
the twenty first day of the second month the planet Mars
invaded the territory of the Pleiades; and it is written in the
astronomical books that if this happens the barbarians will rise,
and also that a General will receive the Imperial Commission to
march beyond the frontier. On the tenth day of the third
month an investiture of officials was held, and most of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
received promotion. On the fifteenth day of the fourth month
the former <persName>Gon-sho-Sozu Genshin</persName> held a service at the shrine
of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName>, when the <title>Hokke Sutra</title> was recited ten thousand
<pb n="16" xml:id="p30-16"/>

times according to the rule, and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> attended it to acquire
merit.
</p>
<p>
Who it was that began it I know not, but a rumour went
forth that the <persName>Ho-o</persName> had bidden the monks of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> attack
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and in consequence of this bands of soldiers marched
on the Palace and camped about it on all sides. The <persName>Heike</persName>
hastily assembled at <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, and <persName>Hon-sammi-no-Chujo Shige-
hira</persName> with a force of three thousand horse set out for the shrine
of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName>. When it was reported at <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> that their
temples were in danger of being attacked, the monks went
down to <placeName>Higashi Sakamoto</placeName> and held a council to find out the
reason.
The <persName>Ho-o</persName> meanwhile was in a state of consternation
at these things, and the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> turned pale with
agitation, while most of the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Guards could not contain
themselves in their flurry. Both in the Capital and in the
temples the trepidation was extreme. Then <persName>Shigehira Kyo</persName>
met the <persName>Ho-o</persName> near <placeName>Anabu</placeName> and accompanied him back to
<placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, and it was found that the stories of His Majesty's
inciting the monks to attack the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> being
about to march against the temples, were both groundless
falsehoods, upon which there were not wanting those who put
them down to supernatural malevolence.
"I suppose I must
not go on any more pilgrimages at my pleasure in future ;
quoth the <persName>Ho-o</persName>.
</p>
<p>
On the twentieth day an Imperial Envoy was sent to the
twenty-two shrines round the Capital; this was on account of
the famine and pestilence. On the twenty-fourth day of the
fifth month the era was changed to Ju-ei, and on the same day
an investiture of officials was held, at which <persName>Jo-no-Shiro
Sukemochi</persName> of <placeName>Echigo</placeName> was made Echigo-no-kami. After the
death of his elder brother <persName>Sukenaga</persName> he rather wished to avoid
the ill-omened honour, but as it was the Imperial Order there
was nothing to be done. He then changed his name to
<persName>Nagamochi</persName>.
</p>
<p>
So on the second day of the ninth month <persName>Jo-no-Shiro</persName>
<pb n="17" xml:id="p31-17"/>

<persName>Nagamochi</persName> assembled the men of <placeName>Echigo</placeName>, <placeName>Dewa</placeName> and <placeName>Aizu</placeName>,
about forty thousand horsemen, and went forth to the province
of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> to attack <persName>Kiso</persName>. On the ninth day he pitched his
camp at <placeName>Yokotagawara</placeName> in that Province, and <persName>Kiso</persName>, who had
been lying in the fortress of <placeName>Yoda</placeName>, issued out with three
"thousand horse and rode to meet him. Now the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of
<placeName>Shinano</placeName>, by the stratagem of <persName>Inoue-no-Kuro Mitsumori</persName>, divided
two thousand of their men into seven parties, each bearing a
red flag, the colour of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and when the warriors of
<placeName>Echigo</placeName> saw these emerging over the rocks and winding out of
the defiles they set up a shout of joy, thinking that many were
for their side in this province also. But as the different bands
approached, at a given signal the whole seven drew together
into one, and, throwing away their red banners, suddenly
replaced them with white ones and advanced to the onset.
When the men of <placeName>Echigo</placeName> saw this manoeuvre panic seized
them and they cried out; "Ah! we have been deceived!
The enemy swarms everywhere! We shall be surrounded!
And thus thrown into confusion they were driven into the river
and stampeded into deep gorges, so that most of them perished,
and but few survived. <persName>Jo-no-Shiro</persName>, when his most redoubtable
champions <persName>Yama-no-Taro</persName> of <placeName>Echigo</placeName> and <persName>Jotanbo</persName> of <placeName>Aizu</placeName>, on
whom he especially relied, had been slain, and himself badly
wounded, escaped with his bare life and fled back to his pro-Two
vince by way of the river. When he reached <placeName>Echigo</placeName> he at
once sent messengers to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> to inform the <orgName>Heike</orgName> of his
mishap, but they carelessly paid no heed. On the sixteenth
day <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName> was again appointed Dai-nagon, and on
the third day of the tenth month he became Nai-daijin. On the
seventh day of the same month he proceeded to the Palace t
offer thanks attended by a brilliant train, including twelve
<persName>Court Nobles</persName> headed by <persName>Kwazan-in Chunagon</persName>, and sixteen of
lesser rank led by <persName>Kurando-no-To Chikamune</persName>. Among them
there were four of the rank of <term>Chunagon</term> and three of that of
<term>Sammi Chujo</term>. So, though the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of the north and west
<pb n="18" xml:id="p32-18"/>

countries were swarming forth everywhere like bees, and were
reported to be even now about to burst in upon the Capital,
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, heedless of the impending storm that was to break
upon them, continued to spend their days in luxury and
extravagance. Thus this year also came to an end and the second
year of Ju-ei began. The New Year Festival was as usual.
On the fifth day of the New Year the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> went on a Visit
of Ceremony to the Palaces of His Imperial Relations. There
was a precedent for this, for the <persName>Emperor Toba</persName> made a like
visit at the age of six years. On the twenty first day of the
second month <persName>Munemori-no-Kyo</persName> was raised to the Lower First
Rank, and on the same day he resigned the office of Naidaijin :
this he was said to have done on account of the revolt.
Then
the monks of <placeName>Nara</placeName> and <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> and the priests of <placeName>Kumano</placeName> and
<placeName>Kinbusen</placeName>, as well as the chief of the <placeName>Daijingu Shrine</placeName> at <placeName>Ise</placeName> and
all his officials rebelled against the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and transferred their
allegiance to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, and though an Imperial Decree was
issued to all the four quarters of the Empire, and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> also
published an Order to the whole country, yet as all concluded
that this was but a device of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, there were none who
paid any attention.

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>THE EXPEDITION TO THE NORTHERN PROVINCES.</head>
<p>At the beginning of the third month of the second year
of Ju-ei there arose some ill feeling between <persName>Kiso-no Kwanja
Yoshinaka</persName> and <persName>Hyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName>, so that <persName>Yoritomo</persName>
despatched a force of a hundred thousand horse to the province
of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> to attack <persName>Kiso</persName>. <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> was at this time at his
stronghold of <placeName>Yoda</placeName>, but when he heard the news he went forth
with some three thousand men and camped at <placeName>Kumasaka-yama</placeName>
on the borders of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> and <placeName>Echigo</placeName>. Then, as soon as
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> had come as far as <placeName>Zenkoji</placeName> in <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, he sent a
message to him by the hand of his foster-brother <persName>Imai-no-Shiro
Kanehira</persName>, saying:
'As you have now subdued the <placeName>Eight Eastern Provinces</placeName>
you can now attack the <orgName>Heike</orgName> from the <placeName>East Sea Road</placeName> and
drive them out of the Capital. I also, after occupying the
<placeName>Eastern and Northern Hill Provinces</placeName>, can fall on them from the
<placeName>Northern Highway</placeName>, so now, when we both ought to haste and
make an end of them as soon as possible, why do you give
them occasion to mock by allowing some estrangement to arise
between us? It is true that our uncle <persName>Juro Kurando Yoshiie</persName>,
who has no love for Your Excellency, has thought fit to come
here, but his presence is exceedingly troublesome to me; yet
what can I do? Though he is here I myself have no feeling of
animosity toward you at all." To which communication <persName>Yori-
tomo</persName> replied thus: "Though you speak thus now, I have
received information that there is a plot to raise a rebellion and
attack me, and that is not all I rely on." So when <persName>Kiso</persName> heard
that an army of many tens of thousands of horsemen under <persName>Doi</persName>
<pb n="20" xml:id="p34-20"/>

and <persName>Kajiwara</persName> was advancing against him, to show the sincerity
of his intentions, he sent his heir, <persName>Shimizu-no Kwanja Yoshi-
shige</persName>, a boy of eleven, escorted by <persName>Umeno</persName>, <persName>Mochizuke</persName>, <persName>Suwa</persName>,
<persName>Fujisawa</persName> and others, who were reckoned among the most
doughty of his warriors, as a hostage to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, acknowledging that his suspicions were
false, and that <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> was quite loyal to him, as he had no
grown up son of his own, adopted <persName>Shimizu-no-Kwanja</persName> as his
son, and taking him with him, went back again to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now when <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> had coerced the districts of the east
and north, he was ready to make an attack on <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>, and as
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had announced during the winter of the previous
year that they would probably move in the spring, the levies
from the <placeName>Sanin</placeName>, <placeName>Sanyo</placeName>, <placeName>Nankai</placeName> and <placeName>Saikai</placeName> districts came
pouring in like mist and clouds. As for the <placeName>Tosan</placeName> or <placeName>Eastern Hill</placeName>
district, the men of <placeName>Omi</placeName>, <placeName>Mino</placeName> and <placeName>Hida</placeName> came in, but on the
<placeName>Tokaido</placeName> none joined them from eastward of <placeName>Omi</placeName>. All the
western districts sent their men, but from the <placeName>Hokurikudo</placeName> not
one arrived from north of <placeName>Wakasa</placeName>. After a Council of Cour-
tiers had been held, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> leaders decided to proceed
against <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> first, and then to attack <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, and
with this purpose their army set out for the north. The Com-
manders in Chief were <persName>Komatsu no-Sammi Chujo Koremori</persName>
and <persName>Echizen-no-Sammi Michimori</persName>, while the Vice-Commanders
were <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName>, <persName>Kogo-gu no-suke Tsunemasa</persName>,
<persName>Awaji-no-kami Kiyofusa</persName> and <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Tomonori</persName>. Six
generals were appointed to lead the samurai, <persName>Etchu-no-Jirohyoye Moritsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-taiyu Hangwan Tadatsuna</persName>,
<persName>Hida-no-taiyu Hangwan Kagetaka</persName>, <persName>Kawachi-no-Hangwan Hide-
kuni</persName>, <persName>Takahashi-no Hangwan Nagatsuna</persName> and <persName>Musashi-no-Saburosaemon Arikuni</persName>, beside whom there were three
hundred and forty other valiant warriors apt to command.
The forces under them were about a hundred thousand
horsemen, and at the hour of the Dragon (8. a.m.) on the
seventeenth day of the fourth month they left <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> for the north

country. As their supplies were insufficient, as soon as they
had crossed the pass of <placeName>Ausaka</placeName> outside the Capital, they began
to seize and appropriate anything they wanted from the estates
and houses that lay by the way, not sparing even the
government property. As they went along by <placeName>Shiga</placeName>, <placeName>Karasaki</placeName>,
<placeName>Mikawajiri</placeName>, <placeName>Mano</placeName>, <placeName>Takashima</placeName>, <placeName>Shiozu</placeName> and <placeName>Kaizu</placeName>, the
inhabitants of these places could not endure it and fled to the
mountains.

<head>CHIKUBUSHIMA.</head>
<p>Now the Generals <persName>Koremori</persName> and <persName>Michimori</persName> pressed on
their way, but <persName>Tadanori</persName>, <persName>Tsunemasa</persName>, <persName>Kiyofusa</persName> and <persName>Tomonori</persName>
tarried a while at <placeName>Shiozu</placeName> and <placeName>Kaizu</placeName> in <placeName>Omi</placeName>. Of these <persName>Kogo-
gu-no suke Tsunemasa</persName> had excelled in poetry and music from
his youth up, and it happened that one morning, wishing to
calm his mind in the midst of these alarms and disorders, he
went out to the edge of the lake to enjoy the scenery. As he
looked out into the offing he saw an island in the distance, and
calling to <persName>Tohyoye-no-Jo Arinori</persName> who had accompanied him,
he asked what island it was. That is the famous island called
<placeName>Chikubushima</placeName>;" replied <persName>Arinori</persName>, whereupon <persName>Tsunemasa</persName>
expressed a wish to go out to it, so they got a small boat and
escorted by <persName>Arinori</persName> and <persName>Anemon-no-Jo Morinori</persName> with six
retainers, he crossed over to <placeName>Chikubushima</placeName>. It was the
eighteenth day of the fourth month, but still the song of the
'Uguisu' of the vale lingered among the green twigs and
recalled the favours of spring, and the ever charming early
notes of the hototogisu answered it, while the clusters of
wistaria hung heavy on the pines. The scene filled <persName>Tsunemasa</persName>
with ecstasy, and he quickly alighted from the boat and climbed
up on to the island, gazing at the beauty of the landscape with
a heart too full for words. Not fairer it seemed was that magic
island of <placeName>Horai</placeName>, whither <persName>Shiko</persName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName> sent many fair youths
<pb n="22" xml:id="p36-22"/>

and maidens, and <persName>Butei</persName> of <placeName>Kan</placeName> despatched a magician, if haply
they might find it and bring back from thence the water of
youth and immortality, but not finding it, and fearing to return
to <placeName>China</placeName>, age overtook them in their ships while they were still
vainly searching the boundless ocean. And in one of the
<title>Sutras</title> it is written: "In the <placeName>Djambudvipa</placeName> is a certain lake;
and in the midst of it, proceeding from the bottom of the world,
there is an isle, formed all of crystal, where fairy maidens
dwell." And this, they say, is the island
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Tsunemasa</persName>, respectfully approaching the <persName>Myojin</persName>, the
deity of the place, prayed thus; ". O thou goddess <persName>Benzaiten</persName>,
who wert known of old under the title of <persName>Nyorai</persName>, and dost
deign to manifest thyself here in a spiritual body as a saviour;
for though we may address thee by the names of <persName>Myo-on-ten</persName>
and <persName>Benzai-ten</persName>, yet in this place thou art united in one body to
save mankind; grant, we beseech thee, the petitions and desires.
that we offer before thee." And as he was still kneeling before
the shrine the dusk fell over the lake, and the waiting moon.
rose over the water so that it turned into silver, and the white
beams bathed the steps of the shrine with light. Then the
priest who lived there, knowing <persName>Tsunemasa's</persName> skill in music,
brought him a biwa, and he played and sang the melodies
called <term>Jogen</term> and <term>Sekijo</term>, so that the liquid notes rang clear
throught the silent shrine. So exquisite it was that the <persName>Myojin</persName>
could not restrain her emotion, but appeared over the shoulder
of <persName>Tsunemasa</persName> as he played, in the form of a white dragon.
<persName>Tsunemasa</persName>, overcome by reverential awe, laid aside his biwa
and composed the stanza;
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Lo! a manifest sign that my humble prayer will be answered,</l>
<l>Since from the depth of the waves, awful the goddess appears."</l>
</lg>
<p>
And so, not doubting that the enemies of the Throne
would soon be subdued and the insurgents put to flight, he
embarked in the boat and returned to the mainland in great joy.

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>THE BATTLE AT HIUCHI.</head>
<p>Now, though <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> himself remained in <placeName>Shinano</placeName>,
he built a stronghold at <placeName>Hiuchi</placeName> in <placeName>Echizen</placeName> and stationed there
<persName>Heizenji-no-Chori Saimei-i-gishi</persName>, <persName>Togashi-no-Nyudo Bussei</persName>,
<persName>Inazu-no-Shinsuke</persName>, <persName>Saitoda</persName>, <persName>Hayashi-no Rokuro Mitsuakira</persName>,
<persName>Ishiguro</persName>, <persName>Miyazaki</persName>, <persName>Tsuchida</persName>, <persName>Takebe</persName>, <persName>Nyuzen</persName>, and <persName>Sami</persName> with
some six thousand men. The situation was naturally strong,
surrounded by towering crags, and with mountain peaks on all
sides A mountain rose before it and another behind, while in
front of it flowed the <placeName>Nomigawa</placeName> and the <placeName>Shindogawa</placeName>. At the
confluence of these two rivers they piled up rocks and drove in
stakes and made a large dam, so that the water came right up
to the hills on the north and south and spread out like a lake.
As the Chinese poet says;" Shadows steep the southern hills;
wide and blue and vast are the waters; the waves melt into the
western sun; the waters redden and look like damask." The
bottom of this cool lake is of sand pure as gold or silver, and
by its brink there float most graceful ships. But the lake of
<placeName>Hiuchi</placeName> in our country was dammed up so that its waters were
dark and deceive the eye.
</p>
<p>
As they had no boats the <orgName>Heike</orgName> force could not easily
cross over it, and so they encamped on the mountain in front
and spent some days idly doing nothing. But <persName>Heizenji-no-Chori Saimei</persName>, who was within the fortress, was a partizan of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and he went round the foot of the mountain, and,
writing a letter, stuck it to the head of an arrow, which he shot
into their camp.
The soldiers found it and took it to their
Commander, who opened it and read thus: "The river was
not formerly as you see it now; it is a mountain stream that
has been dammed up so that it may look muddy and deceive
the eye. If you send men under cover of darkness and cut the
dams, the water will quickly run off, and then you can cross
over at once; thus you can take the place at a disadvantage.
<pb n="24" xml:id="p38-24"/>

Given by me, <persName>Heizenji-no-Chori Saimei-i gishi</persName>." The <persName>Heike</persName>
were overjoyed at this, and when night came they sent men
who cut the dykes, whereupon it turned out that the water was
indeed only a mountain stream and quickly drained away.
</p>
<p>
Without losing any time they at once crossed over, and
although the six thousand men of the garrison made a stout
resistance, it was of no avail. Thus <persName>Heizenji-no-Chori Saimei</persName>
showed his loyalty to the <orgName>Heike</orgName>; but <persName>Togashi-no-Nyudo Bussei</persName>,
<persName>Inazu-no-Shinsuke</persName>, <persName>Saitoda</persName> and <persName>Hayashi-no-Rokuro Mitsuaki</persName>,
seeing that nothing more could he done, retired to <placeName>Kaga</placeName> and
took up positions at <placeName>Shirayama</placeName> and <placeName>Kawachi</placeName>. The <persName>Heike</persName>,
however, immediately pursued them into the province of <placeName>Kaga</placeName>,
and burned the two strongholds of <placeName>Togashi</placeName> and <placeName>Hayashi</placeName>, then,
as there seemed no force anywhere to oppose them, they sent
messengers from the several provinces and stopping-places to
convey the news to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>. These tidings, when they reached
the Capital, greatly encouraged and rejoiced the <persName>Naidaijin</persName> and
all his house. On the eighth day of the fifth month the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
reached <placeName>Shinohara</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Kaga</placeName>, where they divided
their army into two parts. a main body and a smaller force.
The main body consisted of some seventy thousand men under
the command of <persName>Komatsu Sammi-no-Chujo Koremori</persName>, and
<persName>Echizen-no-Sammi Michimori</persName>, with <persName>Etchu-no-Jirohyoye Mori
tsugu</persName> as Commander of the Samurai, and they set out towards
<placeName>Tonamiyama</placeName>, at the boundary of <placeName>Kaga</placeName> and <placeName>Etchu</placeName>. The lesser
force consisted of about thirty thousand commanded by
<persName>Satsuma-no-hami Tadanori</persName>, <persName>Kogo-gu-no-suke Tsunemasa</persName>, <persName>Awa-
ji-no kami Kiyofusa</persName> and <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Tomonori</persName>, with
<persName>Musashi-no-Saburosaemon Arikuni</persName> in command of the Samurai.
They were to march on <placeName>Shiboyama</placeName>, which bounded the pro·
vinces of <placeName>Noto</placeName> and <placeName>Etchu</placeName>. At this time <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> was
at <placeName>Kofu</placeName> in <placeName>Echigo</placeName>, but when he heard of this he marched on
<placeName>Tonamiyama</placeName> with fifty thousand men. After a stra agem that

had succeeded before, he divided his force into seven parts, of
which one, consisting of ten thousand horsemen, marched
against <placeName>Shiboyama</placeName> under the command of his uncle <persName>Juro
Kurando Yukiie</persName>, while two others, under <persName>Higuchi-no-Jiro
Kanemitsu</persName> and <persName>Ochiai-no-Goro Kaneyuki</persName>, of about seven
thousand each, were sent out to <placeName>Kitakurosaka</placeName>. Three other
companies of seven thousand horse, under <persName>Nishina</persName>, <persName>Takahashi</persName>
and <persName>Yamada-no-Jiro</persName> rode towards <placeName>Minami Kurosak</placeName> a while
about ten thousand were concealed in ambush round the slopes
of <placeName>Tonamiyama</placeName> at <placeName>Matsunaga-no-Yanagihara</placeName> and <placeName>Gumi-no-Kibayashi</placeName>. <persName>Imai-no-Shiro Kanehira</persName> with six thousand horse
crossed over the <placeName>Washinose</placeName> and took up his position at <placeName>Hino-
Miyabayashi</placeName>. <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> himself crossed over the <placeName>Oyabe</placeName>
and marched to <placeName>Hannyu</placeName> a little to the north of <placeName>Tonamiyama</placeName>.

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>THE PRAYER OF KISO YOSHINAKA.</head>
<p>"As the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have such a large army they will try to
fight a decisive battle," said <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, “and a decisive victory
or defeat depends on the number of men; but if a large force is
menaced by a larger one it will feel in danger of being
surrounded. So, if we deceive them by carrying thirty white flags
and showing them on the top of <placeName>Kurosaka</placeName>, as soon as the
<persName>Heike</persName> see them they will think we have a larger force than we
really have, and so, fearing to be surrounded if they move
forward, as their present position is high and rocky, they will
consider it the safest plan to stop there for a while and rest their
horses on <placeName>Tonamiyama</placeName>. Then I will manage to keep them
there till dusk comes on, and under cover of darkness I will
drive their whole army over into <placeName>Kurikara</placeName> valley below." So
they set up the thirty flags on the top of the hill of <placeName>Kutosaka</placeName>,
and the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, as they expected, imagining themselves to be
confronted by superior force, and fearing they would be out-
<pb n="26" xml:id="p40-26"/>

flanked, cried out: "Here is plenty of grass and water for the
horses, let us dismount and let them rest a while." And the
place where they rested was <placeName>Saru-no-baba</placeName> among the mountains
of <placeName>Tonami</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> was in <placeName>Hannyu</placeName>, and as he earnestly
scanned the country on all sides, he saw, far off amidst the
green trees of <placeName>Natsuyama</placeName>, what appeared to be a red
shrinefence with the bevelled cross-beams of the shrine above, and a
<term>torii</term> standing before it, and, on asking his guide what shrine it
was, and what deity was worshipped there, the guide replied
that it was the shrine of <persName>Hachiman</persName>, and that that place belonged
to the god. On hearing this <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> was glad beyond
measure and calling <persName>Taiyu-bo Kakumei</persName>, who was a capable
writer, said to him "By great good fortune I now find myself
before the august shrine of <persName>Hachiman</persName>, even as I am about to
go into battle: do you not think it well, both for the sake of
future generations, and as a prayer for my present need, that I
offer up a petition before him?" <persName>Kakumei</persName>, replying that it
would be most suitable, alighted from his horse to write it.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Kakumei</persName> was this day wearing a hitatare of ‘kachi' and
armour with black lacing; his sword was of black lacquer, his
twenty four arrows were feathered with black feathers taken
from the underside of a birds' wing, and he carried a bow
bound with rattan and lacquered. Taking off his helmet and
slinging it to a thong on his shoulder, he produced a small
ink-stone and a paper-case from the bottom of his quiver, sat
down respectfully before <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, and began to write the
petition. This <persName>Kakumei</persName> had been born of a family of Con-
fucian scholars, and was formerly known as <persName>Ku: ando Michihiro</persName>,
when he had been an official of the <placeName>Kwangakuin</placeName>, or College of
Literature, but later he became a monk under the name of
<persName>Saijobo Shinkyu</persName> and dwelt at <placeName>Nara</placeName>. The year before, when
<persName>Takakura-no-Miya</persName> had entered the <placeName>Onjoji</placeName> at <placeName>Miidera</placeName> and
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName> had sent a letter to <placeName>Nara</placeName>, it was this <persName>Shinkyu</persName> who
composed the answer; whatever the priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName> may have
<pb n="27" xml:id="p41-27"/>

thought of it, I know not, but it contained the words: "Now
<persName>Kiyomori</persName> is of the very dregs of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and but the
offscourings of the warrior caste." And <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, when he
heard of it, was exceedingly enraged and burst forth: "How
does a wretched fellow like this <persName>Shinkyu</persName> dare to speak of me,
<persName>Jokai</persName>, in such an insulting manner? Go and seize him quickly
and put him to death. But <persName>Shinkyu</persName> got wind of it and fled in
haste from <placeName>Nara</placeName> and went to the <placeName>north country</placeName>, where he
became scribe to <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> and changed his name to
<persName>Taiyu-bo Kakumei</persName>. And the words of the petition ran thus :
</p>
<p>
"Kimyo chorai! Obedient to thy commands and with
the deepest reverence, O <persName>Hachiman Dai-Bosatsu</persName>! O Lord
who guardeth our Sun-descended Realm. Mighty Ancestor of
our Heaven-shining Imperial Line, reveal thyself in thy Three
Buddha Persons to protect the Throne and help the people,
bursting open the mighty gates in thy three divine personalities.
For many years now has this <persName>Taira</persName> Minister held dominion
over the whole Empire and oppressed the people, acting
impiously toward the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName> and opposing the Throne.
I, <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, born of a warrior line, do unworthily follow my
ancestors' calling, and can no longer bear to think over these
evils, so, trusting my fate to heaven, I do now offer my body
to my country, raising up a loyal army to subdue the rebels.
Nevertheless, though the two hosts of the <orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName> now
stand face to face for battle, while the valour of our soldiers is
as yet unconfirmed, and the heart of thy servant is still touched
with dread, even as we unfurl our banners before the foe, at
once we prostrate ourselves before the altar of thy Three-fold
Divine Beneficence. If thy gracious favour be purely
manifested to us, without doubt the rebels will be put to the sword;
and thus do we eagerly anticipate thy help with tears of joy.
Furthermore, especially since my great-grandfather the former
<persName>Mutsu-no-kami Yoshiie Ason</persName> dedicated himself to thee by
adoption and took the name of <persName>Hachimantaro</persName>, his family have
ever faithfully served thee, and I <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, his humble scion,
<pb n="28" xml:id="p42-28"/>

have for many years bowed my head before thee. If I mention
his great merit, it is as a child who measures the great ocean
with a shell, or as a mantis that lifts up its claws against a
warchariot. Yet, as it is not for my own glory or that of my
house, but for the sake of my Sovereign and of my Country, I
would commend it. Very urgent is my desire, but the purpose
of the gods is dark: verily on thee do I rely that thou wilt
make me to rejoice. Humbly prostrating myself before thee,
I pray that thou wilt put forth thy power both in the light and
in the darkness, and that thou wilt reveal the might of thy
divinity to overthrow our enemies and give us the victory. If
thou deignest to hearken to my supplication and grantest us
S            thy mighty protection, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, that we
may see an auspicious and manifest omen. The eleventh day
of the fifth month of the second year of Juei. Reverently
offered by me <persName>Minamoto Yoshinaka</persName>."
</p>
<p>
Then he himself and thirteen horsemen of his train took
each two large turnip-head arrows from their quivers, and these
together with the petition they deposited before the sanctuary
of the god. Neither was this prayer of such rare earnestness
without an answer from the merciful <persName>Bosatsu</persName>, for he deigned to
look upon it! rom his dwelling afar, and immediately from the
midst of a cloud three wild doves came flying, fluttering and
circling round the white banners of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. So, in old time,
when <persName>Jingo Kogo</persName> went forth to battle with <placeName>Shinra</placeName>, and for a
while the foreign foe prevailed against her armies, the <orgName>Empress</orgName>
lifted up her voice in prayer to heaven, when suddenly three
sacred doves came forth from a cloud and fluttered over the
shields of her men, after which they again attacked and the
enemy were defeated. So it was too when his own ancestor
<persName>Yoriyoshi Ason</persName>, fighting against the outlaws <persName>Sadato</persName> and
<persName>Muneto</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, found the enemy too strong for him, for he
cast fire in the face of the rebels, crying out that it was of no
earthly kindling, but divine fire from heaven. Then there arose
a wind and blew straight in the direction of the foe, so that
<pb n="29" xml:id="p43-29"/>

their stronghold of <placeName>Kuriyagawa</placeName> was burned, whereupon their
armies were routed and <persName>Sadato</persName> and <persName>Muneto</persName> were overthrown.
</p>
<p>
Now, on this occasion <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>, remembering these
former precedents, alighted from his horse, and taking off his
helmet, washed his hands and rinsed his mouth, after which he
made obeisance to the holy doves, his heart full of faith in the
god.

<head>KURIKARA.</head>
<p>Now the two armies of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and <persName>Heike</persName> faced each
other in battle array, the distance between them being scarcely
three cho, but for a while neither side advanced. Then, after a
while fifteen picked horsemen came forth from the host of the
<persName>Genji</persName>, and taking up a position between the two forces, each
man loosed a turnip-headed arrow at the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.. At this fifteen
picked men of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> also advanced and shot their arrows
at the <orgName>Genji</orgName> in turn: then the <orgName>Genji</orgName> sent forth thirty more
horsemen, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> replied with a like number. Fifty
again rode forth from the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and shot their arrows, and
another fifty of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> appeared to meet them. When both
had sent forth a hundred men, and the two bands engaged each
other between the two armies to try a decisive contest, the
<persName>Genji</persName> sent no more men to join them and purposely avoided a
decision. While they were thus engaged in holding them in
check until the sun should set and the night approach, so that
they could drive their whole army into the valley of <placeName>Kurikara</placeName>
beneath, the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, never dreaming of such a piece of strategy,
continued to fight on until nightfall. Then the flanking force,
consisting of some ten thousand men, who had gone round by
the way of the Fudo shrine of <placeName>Kurikara</placeName>, suddenly beat
vigorously on their quivers and shouted their warcry. The
<persName>Heike</persName>, turning to look behind them at the sound, immediately
<pb n="30" xml:id="p44-30"/>

perceived the white flags of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> like a cloud in their rear,
and, as they had thought themselves safe against any flanking
attack owing to the precipitous cliffs on all sides of the position,
the sight threw them into a panic and they knew not how to
act. At this moment <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> himself, with his force
of ten thousand men, shouted his warcry, and immediately the
other bands who were concealed on the slopes of <placeName>Tonami</placeName>, at
<placeName>Yanagihara</placeName> and <placeName>Kinbayashi</placeName>, about ten thousand in all, together
with the six thousand under <persName>Imai Shiro</persName> who lay hid at
<placeName>Miyabayashi</placeName>, also shouted in unison, so that with the roar of
their forty thou and voices it seemed as if the mountain and the
river would be shaken from their seats. Then, as it grew
darker, the <orgName>Genji</orgName> rushed to the attack on both front and rear,
and though many adjured their fellows to come back and not
to disgrace themselves by flight, when once panic seizes a great
army it is not easy to stop it, so the <orgName>Heike</orgName> stampeded in a
pellmell flight into the valley of <placeName>Kurikara</placeName>. As those behind could
not see those in front, they thought there must be a road at
the the bottom of the valley, and so the whole army went
down one after another, son after father, brother after brother
and retainer after lord, horses and men falling on top of one
another and piling up in heaps upon heaps. Thus did some
seventy thousand horsemen of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> perish, buried in this
one deep valley: the mountain streams ran with their blood
and the mound of corpses was like a small hill; and in this
valley, it is said, there can be seen the marks of arrows and
swords even to this day. <persName>Kazusa-na-taiyu Hangwan Tadatsuna</persName>,
<persName>Hida-no taiyu Hangwan Kagetaka</persName> and <persName>Kawachi-no-Hangwan
Hidekuni</persName>, who were in command of the samurai, perished with
their men at the bottom of this valley, while <persName>Seo-no-Taro
Kaneyasu</persName> of <placeName>B tchu</placeName>, a warrior of great renown, deserted by
fortune on this occasion, was taken alive by <persName>Kuramitsu-no-Jiro

"Let that most worthless priest be put to death immediately;
whereupon they fell on him and beheaded him. The Com-
manders-in Chief, <persName>Koremori</persName> and <persName>Michimori</persName>, strange to relate,
escaped with their lives and fled to the province of <placeName>Kaga</placeName>, but
out of the whole army of seventy thousand men, barely two
thousand horsemen survived.
</p>
<p>
On the twelfth day of the same month <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> received
a present of two splendid horses from <persName>Fujiwara Hidehira</persName> of
<placeName>Mutsu</placeName>: one was cream-coloured and the other was grey with
black spots. These he caparisoned with richly decorated
saddles and dedicated to the shrine of <placeName>Shirayama</placeName> as sacred
steeds. <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> now felt no anxiety about his position, but
was in some doubt how his uncle <persName>Juro Kurando Yukiie</persName> had
fared in the battle at <placeName>Shiho</placeName>, so, choosing twenty thousand
picked horsemen from his army of forty thousand, he rode off
thither. On the way they came to the inlet of <placeName>Himi</placeName> which
must be crossed, but as the tide was high at the time, they did
not know whether the water was shallow enough to ford, so
<persName>Yoshinaka</persName> took ten saddled horses and drove them into the
waves, and as they reached the further bank without more than
wetting the saddles, they all rode in after them and crossed
without difficulty. When they got to the other side, as they
had expected, they found that <persName>Yukiie</persName> had retired after being
hard pressed by the enemy, and was resting his men and
horses. Immediately the fresh twenty thousand men of the
<persName>Genji</persName> rode forward and dashed into the thirty thousand of the
<persName>Heike</persName> with such a shock as caused fire to fly rth as the two
opposing hosts crashed together in the melee. <persName>Mikawa-no-
kami Tomonori</persName>, the Commander of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> was killed: he
was the youngest son of the <persName>Lay priest Chancellor</persName>. Beside him
many other warriors fell, and the rest sought safety in flight
and retired to the province of <placeName>Kaga</placeName>. <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> then crossed
the mountain of <placeName>Shiho</placeName> with ten thousand men, and pitched his
camp before the barrow of <placeName>Shino</placeName> at <placeName>Odanaka</placeName> in the province
of <placeName>Noto</placeName>.

<head>THE BATTLE AT SHINOHARA.</head>
<p>After these victories <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> presented lands to
all the shrines in that district; to <placeName>Yahata</placeName> at <placeName>Tada</placeName> he presented
the manor of <placeName>Choya</placeName>, to the shrine of <placeName>Sugabu</placeName> the manor of
<placeName>Nomi</placeName>, to the shrine of <placeName>Kebi</placeName> the manor of <placeName>Hanbara</placeName>, and to that
of <placeName>Shirayama</placeName> the two manors of <placeName>Yokoe</placeName> and <placeName>Miyamaru</placeName>, while
to the temple of <placeName>Heizenji</placeName> he gave the seven parishes of
<placeName>Fujishima</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now those samurai who had fought against <persName>Hyoye-no-
suke Yoritomo</persName> at <placeName>Ishibashiyama</placeName> in the eighth month of the
fourth year of Jishō had all fled to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> and joined the
<persName>Heike</persName>, chief among whom were <persName>Nagai-no-Saitō Bettō Sanemori</persName>,
<persName>Ukisu-no-Saburō Kagechika</persName>, <persName>Matano-no-Gorō Kagehisa</persName>, <persName>Itō-no-Kurō Sukeuji</persName> and <persName>Mashimo-no-Shirō Shigenao</persName>. As they
wished to rest for a while before fighting again, they were
amusing themselves by going round to each other's quarters in
turn every day and having a drinking-bout. When it was the
turn of <persName>Saitō Bettō Sanemori</persName> to be host, and the others had
assemblea at his house, he remarked: "Judging by the way
things are happening just now, it appears that the <orgName>Genji</orgName> are the
stronger party and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> will get the worst of it; what do
you think about going to join <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>? The rest
seemed to have no particular objection, so the next day, when
it was their turn to meet at the house of <persName>Ukisu ne-Saburō
Kagechika</persName>, <persName>Sanemori</persName> began again : Well, what do you say
about carrying out my suggestion of yesterday?" Then
<persName>Matano Gorō Kagehisa</persName> spoke out and said: "We are all
warriors of reputation, and well known in the <placeName>Eastern Pro-
vinces</placeName>; it is a disgraceful thing for samurai to change from one
side to the other according to the way fortune inclines; as for
you others I do not know what you intend to do, but for
myself I have made up my mind to die on the side of the
<persName>Heike</persName>." Then <persName>Saitō Bettō</persName> laughed scornfully and replied:
<pb n="33" xml:id="p47-33"/>

"What I said yesterday was only to try you all; I also have
determined to go and die in the <placeName>North Country</placeName>, and I have
already declared my intention to <persName>Munemori</persName>, and to others as
well." On hearing this the remainder all stated their resolution
to do likewise, and, pitiful to relate, faithful to their promise,
all these twenty samurai afterwards fell in battle in the <placeName>Northern
Provinces</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had retreated to <placeName>Shinohara</placeName> in the province
of <placeName>Kaga</placeName> to gain time to rest their men and horses, but <persName>Kiso
Yoshinaka</persName> pursued after them with fifty thousand horsemen,
and on the twentieth day of the fifth month he again confronted
them. <persName>Imai Shirō Kanehira</persName> immediately rode forward with
five hundred men, and against him from the <orgName>Heike</orgName> ranks came
<persName>Hatakeyama Shōji Shigeyoshi</persName>, <persName>Oyamada-no-Bettō Arishige</persName> and
<persName>Utsunomiya-no-Saemon Tomotsuna</persName> with three hundred. These
knights were often in <placeName>Kyōto</placeName> on guard duty, and as they were
veteran warriors <persName>Munemori</persName> had sent them to the <placeName>North
Provinces</placeName> to assist in the campaign with their advice. So
<persName>Hatakeyama</persName> and <persName>Imai</persName> detached first five, and then ten of their
samurai to begin the contest and see who would prove the
better, after which the two forces attacked each other in
mingled combat. It was at high noon on the twenty first day
that they joined battle, and both sides fought fiercely and
stubbornly, while the sun shone hot over their heads and there
was no breeze even to move a blade of grass, so that the sweat
poured down over their bodies as if they had been plunged in
water. At last, when most of his retainers had fallen, <persName>Hatake-
yama</persName> was compelled to retire, though on <persName>Imai's</persName> side also very
many men were slain Then <persName>Takahashi-no-Hangwan Nagatsuna</persName>
with five hundred men came forth from the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and
<persName>Higuchi-no-Jirō Kanemitsu</persName> and <persName>Ochiai no-Gorō Kaneyuki</persName> with
three hundred rode out from <persName>Kiso's</persName> force to meet them, and
for some time both parties fought on the defensive; <persName>Takahashi's</persName>
men, however, being samurai from various provinces, did not
stand the onset, but broke and fled, each for himself, heedless
<pb n="34" xml:id="p48-34"/>

of the orders of their leader. <persName>Takahashi</persName> himself, though a
most valiant fighter, was forced to retreat for lack of support,
and rode away alone to the southward. Then <persName>Nyüzen-no-Kotaro Yukishige</persName> of <placeName>Etchū</placeName>, burning to overcome so stout an
adversary, urged on his horse with whip and stirrup and
overtook him. Coming up beside him he closed and grappled
with him, but <persName>Takahashi</persName> gripped him hard, and pinned him
against the front of his saddle so that he could not move,
crying at the some time:
"Who are you, sir! Declare your
name and titles!" "I am <persName>Nyūzen-no-Kotarō Yukishige</persName> of
the Province of <placeName>Etchu</placeName>, and my age is eighteen!" replied his
assailant. On hearing this the tears ran down <persName>Takahashi's</persName> face
as he exclaimed: "Ah, how pitiful! If my lad, who fell last
year, had lived till now, he would be just eighteen; I ought to
twist your neck and cut off your head, but as it is I will let you
go": and he released him.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Takahashi</persName> got off his horse to recover his breath
and wait to see if any of his retainers would come up, and
<persName>Nyüzen</persName> also dismounted, but, still thinking what a feat it would
be to kill such a famous leader, even though he had just spared
his life, he cast about to see how he could take him unawares.
<persName>Takahashi</persName>, never dreaming of such treachery, was talking to
him quite without reserve, when <persName>Nyüzen</persName>, who was famed for
the rapidity of his movements, catching him off his guard,
suddenly drew his sword and aimed a lightning thrust under
his helmet. Just then, as he staggered back from the blow,
three of <persName>Nyuzen's</persName> retainers came up, and <persName>Takahashi</persName>, stout
warrior though he was, was borne down by superior numbers
and slain.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Musashi-no-Saburōemon Arikuni</persName> of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> bore
down on his foes with three hundred horse, and <persName>Nishina</persName>, <persName>Takan-
ashi</persName> and <persName>Yamada-no-Jirō</persName> opposed him with five hundred, and
for a while both parties fought warily, but by-and-by <persName>Arikuni</persName>,
having penetrated very deeply into the ranks of the foe, had
his horse shot under him, and then, while he was fighting on
<pb n="35" xml:id="p49-35"/>

foot, his helmet was struck from his head, so that he looked
like a youth fighting with his long hair streaming in all
directions. By this time all his arrows were exhausted, so he
drew his sword and laid about him mightily until, pierced by
seven or eight shafts, he met his death still on his feet and glaring
fiercely at his enemies. After their leader had thus fallen his
retainers gave up the fight and fled.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7" xml:id="v7_ch7">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>THE DEATH of SANEMORI.</head>
<p>Now among the retreating <persName>Heike</persName> retainers was <persName>Nagai-no-Saitō Bettō Sinemori</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, and he had a certain intention
in his mind. He was clad in a red brocaded hitatare over
armour with green lacing, and on his head was a helmet
surmounted by lofty horns. He wore a gold mounted sword
and a quiver of twenty four arrows with black and white
feathers, and his bow was of black lacquer bound with red
rattan.
He rode a grey horse with black spots and his saddle
was richly ornamented with gold.
Though his companions
kept on retiring, he alone continued
to turn back and engage
the enemy to protect their rear. Then one of <persName>Kiso's</persName> men
named <persName>Tezuka-no-Tarō</persName> rode forward and shouted to him;
"How splendid! Though all your side are in flight, you
only, one single knight, dare to face us alone in such gallant
fashion; I pray you declare your name." Who then are you
that ask? replied <persName>Sanemori</persName>. "I am <persName>Tezuka-no Taro
Kanesashi-no-Mitsumori</persName> of <placeName>Shinano</placeName>," answered the other.
"Then", replied <persName>Sanemori</persName>, "you will suit me well; and I too
shall not disgrace your arms, though, for a certain reason I
cannot declare my name. Come on <persName>Tezuka</persName>! A grapple !"
But as he rushed upon him, one of <persName>Tezuka's</persName> retainers, fearful
that his master might be slain, thrust himself in between and
received the onslaught. "Ho! who are you that wishes for
the honour of being sped by the greatest warrior in <placeName>Nippon</placeName> ?"
<pb n="36" xml:id="p50-36"/>

cried <persName>Sanemori</persName>, as he caught him in his arms and pressed him
tight against the front of his saddle so that he could not move,
the while he twisted his neck round and cut off his head.
<persName>Tezuka</persName> himself, seeing his retainer thus fall, slipped round to
the left side of his opponent, and lifting the skirts of his
armour, stabbed him twice and then pulled him from his horse,
weakened as he was from the wounds. Thus, spite of his
great strength and valour, fell <persName>Saitō Sanemori</persName>, for he was
wearied with his long struggle, besides being well advanced in
years.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Tezuka</persName>, giving the head to one of his men who ran
up, came into the presence of <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> and bowed low.
"I have brought your lordship," said he, "the head of a
strange fellow whom I have fought with and slain. He might
be a great leader, but he had no following; he might be a
simple samurai, but he wears a hitatare of brocade. When I
bade him declare his rank, he demanded mine but would not
give his own. His speech is that of one of the warriors of the
<placeName>Kwantō</placeName>." "Ah," exclaimed <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, "this must be <persName>Saitō
Bettō</persName>. Indeed? I remember seeing him once when I went
over to <placeName>Kōzuke</placeName>; I was only a small boy then but I think his
hair was nearly white, so he must be over seventy now, and
ought to be quite white-haired; but this hair and beard is
black. Ho, there! summon <persName>Higuchi-no-Jirō Kanemitsu</persName>; he
is about the same age as <persName>Sanemori</persName> and knew him well."
<persName>Higuchi</persName>, answering the summons, entered, and after a single
glance at the head, burst into tears: "Alas!" he exclaimed,
"it is indeed <persName>Saitō Bettō</persName>." "Then," said <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, "how
is it that his hair is still black, for he must be more than
seventy?" <persName>Higuchi</persName>, repressing his tears, replied: "Ah,
that the pitifulness of his fate should have moved me to these
weak tears; still, we warriors are apt to be touched by the
recollection of even these trifling things. I remember when we
were talking together, as we were often went to do, that he
said to me; "I am over sixty now, but if I go to fight again I
<pb n="37" xml:id="p51-37"/>

shall dye my hair black and become young once more, for I
will not be pitied as a decrepit old knight, or look foolish if I
strive for place among the youthful blades." Verily his hair
is only dyed, and if you have it washed my words may be
proved." So <persName>Kiso</persName> ordered the head to be washed forthwith,
and the hair turned white even as <persName>Higuchi</persName> had said.
</p>
<p>
With regard to <persName>Sanemori's</persName> wearing a hitatare of brocade
the reason was this. When he went to take leave of the <persName>Daijin
Munemori</persName> he said to him: "There is one request that I wish
to make, and it concerns me alone. Last year, when I went
down with our men to the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, I was startled by
the noise of the water-fowl and fled in panic from <placeName>Kambara</placeName> in
<placeName>Suruga</placeName> without so much as shooting one arrow, and that was a
disgrace to my old age. Now I am going on the campaign in
the North and there I intend to die. It was in that land that I
was born, in <placeName>Echizen</placeName>, and it is only of late years that I have
lived in <placeName>Nagai</placeName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, the domain that your bounty has
bestowed upon me. According to the proverb; Wear
brocade when you return to your birth place," I beg your
lordship, if it is not too much to ask, to allow me the favour
of wearing a hitatare of brocade." <persName>Munemori</persName>, touched by the
gallantry of his address, gave him permission forthwith. As in
<placeName>China</placeName> <persName>Shu-bai-shin</persName> flaunted his brocaded sleeves at <placeName>Kwai-kei-
san</placeName>, so <persName>Saitō Bettō Sanemori</persName> would make a name in the <placeName>North
Country</placeName>. Imperishable, though vain, is the reputation he
made, while his corpse mingles with the dust of the <placeName>Northland</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Thus of the ten thousand men of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> who set out from
the Capital on the seventeenth day of the fourth month, ready
to confront any foe, barely twenty thousand returned at the
end of the fifth. 'If you fish out all the rivers, you will get a
lot a fish, but next year there will be none; if you burn the
cover to hunt you will catch a lot of beasts, but next year
there will be none ; it would have been wiser to have taken
thought for the future and kept some behind," was the opinion
of most people.

<head>GENBO.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Kazusa-no-kami Tadakiyo</persName> and <persName>Hida-no-kami Kageie</persName>
had both become recluses the year before last, when the <persName>Nyūdō</persName>
departed this life, and when they heard that all their sons had
been killed in the <placeName>Northern Provinces</placeName>, their grief was so sore
that at length it terminated their lives and they died. And
beside them the multitude of parents who mourned the loss of
their children, and wives who bewailed their slain husbands,
was without number. In the Capital every door was shut, and
night and day could be heard the sound of the ringing of bells
and the chanting of the <term>Nembutsu</term>, and weeping and
lamentations. And in all the provinces round about, both near and
far, it was no different.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of the sixth month <persName>Saishu-Jingi-no-Gon-no-Taiyū Ōnakatomi Chikatoshi</persName> was summoned to the lower
gate of the Palace and informed that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> would
proceed in state to the <placeName>Great Shrines</placeName>, of <placeName>Ise</placeName> to pray that the
rebellion might be pacified. This was the Shrine of the <persName>Sun-
Goddess</persName> who descended in ancient times from the <placeName>Plains of
High Heaven</placeName>, and in the third month of the twenty fifth year
of the reign of the <persName>Mikado Suijin Tennō</persName> removed from <placeName>Kasanui</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Yamato</placeName>, and deigned to be worshipped by
the banks of the <placeName>Isusugawa</placeName> in the district of <placeName>Watarai</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Ise</placeName>, "making stout the shrine-pillars to the
nethermost rock-bottom"; incomparable and preeminent among the
three thousand seven hundred and fifty greater and lesser
shrines of the sixty provinces of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>. But from this time
until the reign of <persName>Shōmu Tennō</persName>, the <persName>Mikado</persName> of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, no
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> had gone there to worship. Then in the tenth month
of the fifteenth year of Tempyō, when <persName>Sakonye-no-Shōshō
Dazai-no Shōni Fujiwara Hirotsugu</persName>, son of <persName>Sangi Shikibu-no-Kyō Umagai</persName> and grandson of the <persName>Sadaijin Fuhito</persName>, raised an
army of many myriads of men in the district of <placeName>Matsuura</placeName> in
<pb n="39" xml:id="p53-39"/>

the province of <placeName>Hizen</placeName>, and menaced the peace of the Empire,
the <persName>Mikado</persName> proceeded in state to <placeName>Ise</placeName> for the first time to pray
for his downfall. Now this <persName>Hirotsugu</persName> possessed a horse of
wondrous swiftness, that could complete the journey from
<placeName>Matsuura</placeName> in <placeName>Hizen</placeName> to the Capital in one single day; and it is
said that, when his army was defeated and fled, he mounted
this horse and rode into the sea, and that afterwards his wraith
appeared in that province and did many terrible things. And
there was a certain <persName>Genbo Sōjō</persName> who was priest of the temple of
<placeName>Kwannonji</placeName> in the <placeName>Dazaifu</placeName> in the district of <placeName>Mikasa</placeName> of the
province of <placeName>Chikuzen</placeName>, and it happened that on the eighteenth
day of the sixth month of the eighteenth year of the era of
Tempyō, as he was sitting on his high seat and striking the
bell in the service, that the sky suddenly clouded over and
there was a heavy thunderstorm, and a bolt struck him and
took off his head, carrying it away into the clouds. And this
was because he had invoked a course on <persName>Hirotsugu</persName> when they
marched to overthrow him. This <persName>Sōjō</persName> went to <placeName>China</placeName> with
the <persName>Dajin of Kibi</persName> and brought back with him the <title>Sutras</title> of the
<term>Hossō Sect</term>, and the men of <placeName>China</placeName> laughed at the name <persName>Genbo</persName>,
saying that it sounded like the word for 'Destruction, and
indeed, when he came back to his own country it was
prophesied that some misfortune would happen to him. After-
wards, on the eighteenth day of the sixth month of the
nineteenth year of Tempyō, a skull, inscribed with the name
<persName>Genbo</persName>, fell into the courtyard of the <placeName>Kōfukuji</placeName>, while at the
same time there was a sound as of the loud laughter of some
two or three hundred men from the sky. It was no doubt
because <placeName>Kōfukuji</placeName> was a temple of the <term>Hosso Sect</term>. Then his
disciples took the skull and made a mound over it, and it is
known as the <placeName>Skull Mound</placeName> and can be seen there to this day.
On the place where the spirit of <persName>Hirotsugu</persName> is worshipped is the
Shrine called '<placeName>Kagami-no-miya</placeName>' at <placeName>Matsuura</placeName> in <placeName>Hizen</placeName>. And in
the time of <persName>Saga Tennō</persName>, when the retired <persName>Emperor Heijō</persName>, at
the instigation of his consort, tried to seize the Throne and
<pb n="40" xml:id="p54-40"/>

trouble the Empire, the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> sent the third princess to
<placeName>Kamo</placeName> as <term>Sai-in</term> or Imperial Priestess to offer supplication.
And this was the first appointment of a <term>Sai-in</term>. Again, in thè
reign of <persName>Shujaku Tennō</persName>, a special festival was held in honour
of <persName>Hachiman</persName> to pray for the subjection of the rebel <persName>Sumitomo</persName>.
So now, on account of these precedents, many prayers were
offered by the Imperial House.

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>KISO SENDS A LETTER TO HIEIZAN.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> was at <placeName>Kōfu</placeName> in <placeName>Echizen</placeName>, and he
summoned all his relations and retainers and held a consulation
saying: "If I march on <placeName>Kyōto</placeName> by way of <placeName>Ōmi</placeName>, those priests
of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> are sure to try to stop me. It will not perchance be
difficult to break through them, but because the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have
paid no respect to the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName>, but have destroyed
temples and killed priests and done all manner of evil things, if
I, who am going up to the Capital to protect it, have to begin
by fighting with these priests, my conduct will appear not a
whit different from theirs, but merely another dance to the
same tune. This is no easy matter; what is to be done?"
Then <persName>Taiyu-bō Kakumei</persName>, who had written the former letter,
stood forth and said: "There are some two thousand priests
on <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and it is certain that they will not be of the same
opinion; some will be on the side of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and others will
favour the <orgName>Genji</orgName> : if you send a letter to them you will see, for
their answer will show their disagreement." "That is well
said," replied <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>; "write them a letter forthwith." So
<persName>Kakumei</persName> indited a letter to the priests, and the words of it
were as follows:
</p>
<p>
"I, <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, have well considered the evil deeds of the
<persName>Heike</persName> house. Ever since the time of Hogen and Heiji they have
forgotten their duty as subjects and have set up and pulled down
<persName>Emperors</persName> as they please, while high and low could do nothing,
</p>
<p><pb n="41" xml:id="p55-41"/>

and priest and layman were treated with contempt. They have
seized provinces at their will, and without right or reason have
imprisoned men of standing and authority; putting to death
prince, minister, vassal or subject, though their guilt or
innocence was yet unproven. They have taken away their
goods and given them to their retainers; they have confiscated
their manors and improperly curtailed their descendant's
possessions. Moreover in the eleventh month of the third year
of Jishō they removed the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> to the <placeName>Seinan Detached Palace</placeName>,
and exiled the <persName>Kwampaku</persName> to a lonely and far-off coast. The
roads have eyes, though all the people kept silent. Again in
the fourth year of the same era they laid seige to the Palace of
the second son of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, so that the very dust of the Palace
Courts was astonished at such an outrage; and when, in
order to escape such undeserved injury, he fled in secret
to <placeName>Onjoji</placeName>, I, who had received intimation beforehand, was
exceeding eager to ride at once to his rescue, but the
highroads were full of the enemy everywhere, and I was
unable to arrive in time.
</p>
<p>
As the <orgName>Genji</orgName> who were near at hand did not go, how
much less could those who were far off. Then, as <placeName>Onjōji</placeName> could
not protect him, he sought to gain the <placeName>South Capital</placeName>, and in
the fight that ensued on the bridge at <placeName>Uji</placeName>, <persName>Sammi Nyūdō
Yorimasa</persName> and his sons, counting their lives as nought in their
loyalty, after one last glorious battle, unable to prevail against
numberless foes, left their bones to bleach on the moss of the
shore. Their names were washed away like the waves of the
river, but their Lord's commands were engraved on their
hearts, and with sorrow at their loss his life was extinguished.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of the <placeName>North</placeName> and <placeName>East Country</placeName> have
assembled together to overthrow the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and in the autumn
of last year, when I took sword in hand and raised my banner
with that purpose, on the day that I went forth from <placeName>Shinano</placeName>,
<persName>Jō-no-Shirō Nagamochi</persName> opposed me with many tens of
thousands of horsemen, and a battle was fought at <placeName>Yokotagawa</placeName>.
<pb n="42" xml:id="p56-42"/>

There with but three thousand men behind me I routed and
destroyed that mighty host, and the fame of my victory spread
everywhere in the land. At this the <orgName>Heike</orgName> sent a great army
of a hundred thousand horsemen into the <placeName>North Country</placeName>, and
in <placeName>Echizen</placeName> and <placeName>Kaga</placeName>, at <placeName>Tonami</placeName>, <placeName>Kurosaka</placeName>, <placeName>Shiozaka</placeName> and
<placeName>Shinohara</placeName> many battles were fought. "Wrapping up my
plans in a curtain I won my victories in a stone's throw" as it
is said. Whenever I struck the foe gave way, and whenever I
attacked he was always defeated. As the blasts of autumn
level the reeds, and as the winter hoar-frosts wither the grasses,
so they gave way before my onset. Such victories were not
gained by my power, but were due to the aid of the gods and
<persName>Buddhas</persName>. Now that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> armies have been thus defeated,
I intend to advance upon the Capital, and in order to enter into
its streets I must pass beneath the foot of your Holy Mountain;
but as yet I am in doubt which side you favour, whether you
incline to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> or will help the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. If you are in
league with that evil faction then surely I must do battle with
your temples, and in that case the destruction of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> will.
follow without delay. Ah, the pity of it! Because the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
have caused great grief to the heart of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, and have
made the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName> of no account, I have raised up a
loyal army to subdue their evil ways, and now how painful will
it be if I must fight an unlooked for battle with the three
thousand priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>. If, from respect to <persName>Yakushi
Nyorai</persName> and to the god of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> I should hesitate to advance,
I shall be culpable as a negligent subject of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and a
disgrace to the warrior caste. Thus in this state of uncertainty
I await your esteemed communication, O most reverend
brethren of the <persName>Tendai</persName> sect; and I beseech you, for the sake
of the gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName>, of the Throne and of the Country,
that you make cause with the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and punish these rebels,
that we may all rejoice in the beneficent rule of our Sovereign,
and the abundance of his gracious favour.

<p>
I thus address you in all respect. The tenth day of the

<head>THE REPLY OF HIEIZAN.</head>
<p>When the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> read this letter, as <persName>Kakumei</persName>
had said, some were in favour of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and some of the
<persName>Genji</persName>. All of them expressed different opinions. Then the
senior priests held a council and argued thus:
"These
temples have ever devotedly prayed for the long life and
prosperity of our Heaven-descended Sovereign, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> are
the maternal relations of our present Ruler, so that it is our
duty to pay them especial respect. Nevertheless, as they have
grown lawless beyond measure, the people have rebelled against
them, so that they have sent armies to put down the rebels,
but these have been destroyed by the insurgents. Of late the
<persName>Genji</persName> have been many times victorious and their prospects are
ever growing brighter; why then should we alone espouse the
waning fortunes of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and resist the rising tide of the
<persName>Genji</persName> ? Let us therefore turn away from our connexion with
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and ally our forces with the <orgName>Genji</orgName>." Thus the three
thousand priests decided, and they wrote their answer and sent
it. When he received it, <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> again summoned his family
and his retainers, and bade <persName>Kakumei</persName> read the letter.
It ran
thus:
</p>
<p>
"Your letter of the tenth day of the sixth month, being
received by us on the sixteenth day, we respectfully perused,
and for many days were possessed by great perplexity, which
has in one hour been resolved. The evil deeds of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
have for many years caused trouble to the Imperial House:
as the proverb says, "Actions remain in people's mouths;
they cannot be lost." Our mountain of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, whose shrines
stand on the north east of the Imperial Capital, is especially
bound to pray for the peace and quietness of the Empire, but
<pb n="44" xml:id="p58-44"/>

since the Throne has been menaced by this calamity, the whole
Realm has been disquieted. It has been as though the
protecting power of the <persName>Nyorai</persName> had ceased to encircle us, and the
might of the tutelary deities had been taken away. You, born
of a family of generations of warriors, have been providentially
chosen at this crisis. By brilliant tactics you have raised up a
trusty and loyal army, and in the face of a thousand dangers
have won a glorious victory. Moreover, as this is but the
second year of your conquering career, ere long your fame
will be known through all the land. Very greatly do we
rejoice at these tidings. With all our hearts do we admire your
valour and martial exploits on behalf of our country and people,
and we hear with gladness that your petitions to the high gods
have not been in vain, for that they tarried not in coming to
the aid of the Empire. And especially do we rejoice that the
Buddhist doctrine of these and all other temples, and the bright
deities of our shrines both small and great, shall again return
to their former prosperity, and once more be revered as in
former days. Moreover may the <persName>Twelve Warrior Gods</persName>, who
attend on our Lord <persName>Yakushi Nyorai</persName>, go with your brave armies
to smite the rebels, while we, the three thousand priests of
these temples, leaving for a while our sacred studies, will lend
our aid to punish the malefactors. May the pure blasts of the
<persName>Tendai</persName> doctrine sweep away the wicked from this peaceful
Realm, and the might of the Three Mystic Doctrines of our Holy
Law pour down as rain moistens a thirsty land.
Given by us
in council: second day of the seventh month of the second
year of Ju-ei.

<head>COMBINED PETITION OF THE HEIKE.</head>
<p>Now the <orgName>Heike</orgName> Lords never even dreamed of such a thing
as this. <placeName>Kōfukuji</placeName> of <placeName>Nara</placeName> and <placeName>Onjōji</placeName> of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> no doubt
harboured resentment against them, so that, if they addressed
<pb n="45" xml:id="p59-45"/>

them it was unlikely that they would respond, but with <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>
they had had no quarrel, neither had its priests ever up to the
present been disloyal to them. So ten of the <persName>Courtiers</persName> of that
family bethought themselves to write a petition and send it to
the mountain, to solicit the help of the priests and invoke the
divine aid of their gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName>. And these were the
words of it:
</p>
<p>
‘Regarding <placeName>Enryakuji</placeName> as our family temple and the god
of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> as our tutelary deity, reverently worshipping the
Buddhist Law of the <persName>Tendai</persName> Sect. we, members of our one
family, do here respectfully offer a petition. And the
reason is this. Ever since in the reign of <persName>Kwammu Tennō</persName>
<persName>Dengyō Daishi</persName> went to <placeName>China</placeName> and again returned to this land,
and in this temple preached the original Law of <persName>Tendai</persName> and
expounded the <title>Sutras</title> of the <term>Mahayana</term>, it has flourished
greatly as a sacred dwelling-place of religion and a source of
peace and protection to our Empire. Now <persName>Minamoto-no-Yoritomo</persName>, who was in exile in <placeName>Izu</placeName>, showing no repentance of
his fault, on the contrary has set at nought the laws of the
country and hatched evil plots, with which <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, <persName>Yukiie</persName>
and many other of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> are associated, and has seized
many provinces both near and far, appropriating all their
property and collecting their revenues. Therefore, relying on.
the meritorious deeds of our ancestors and the skill and prowess
of our soldiers, and bearing moreover the Imperial Commands,
we have taken in hand the punishment of these rebels and the
subduing of the traitors. Up to this time, however, the
farflung hosts of the Imperial Army have not prevailed, but
victory has, in some sort, rested with the impetuous and
thronging forces of the rebels. Without the aid of the gods
and <persName>Buddhas</persName> how can we overcome the traitors? Moreover,
when we speak of the ancestors of our house, it was they who
first founded your venerable fanes, and from age to age have
their descendants added their tribute of worship and adoration,
Now and henceforth will all our house rejoice in the joy of
<pb n="44" xml:id="p60-46"/>

your temples, while the enemies of your shrines shall be
counted as our own. Thus will we do and thus will we
instruct our descendants, that the memory of it may never
perish. The house of <persName>Fujiwara</persName> hold the god of <placeName>Kasuga</placeName> as
their tutelary deity and <placeName>Kōfukuji</placeName> as their family temple,
revering the Mahayana doctrine of the <term>Hossō Sect</term>; and so also are
the fortunes of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house bound up with the shrine of
<placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> and the temple of <placeName>Enryakuji</placeName>, and the perfect teachings
of its Holy Law. It has been our legacy from old time to
consider the glory of our house, but now it is for the sake of
our Sovereign that we pray for the punishment of the rebels.
We beseech ye, O deities of the <placeName>Seven Great Shrines</placeName>, and
ye gods of the far-ranging shrines of the whole mountain,
and thy twelve sacred promises, O <persName>Yakushi Nyorai</persName>; pour
upon us the beneficent light of thy kindly truth, and come
to meet us with thy gracious aid. That the hands of
these evil plotters may be bound at the gate of our
camp, and that we may bring their heads in triumph to
the Capital. This is the united petition of our whole
house. <persName>Ju-sammi Echizen-no-kami Taira-no-Ason Michimori</persName>,

<p>
When the <persName>Zasshū</persName> of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> received this latter he was
deeply grieved, and did not show it to the other priests at once,
but retired and spent three days in prayer before the <placeName>Jūzenji
<pb n="47" xml:id="p61-47"/>

Gongen</placeName>, after which he showed it to them. On his opening
the petition, this verse, which he had not noticed before, fell
out of it:
</p>
<lg type="romaji">
<l>Tairaka ni hana saku yado mo toshi fureba,</l>
<l>Nishi ye katamuku tsuki tɔ koso mire.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Peaceful the years we have passed in this spot where the flowers ever blossom,</l>
<l>"Now is the moon, like our fate, waning to sink in the west."</l>
</lg>
<p>
The Chief Priest of <placeName>Hiyoshi</placeName> was also very sad, and bade the three
thousand monks lend their aid, but, as for long the deeds
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been contrary to the will of the gods as
well as unpopular among the people, prayers were of no
avail and no one would pay any heed. The priests were
indeed sorry that things had come to such a pass, but, as they
had already sent the letter promising help to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, as to
their lightly changing their mind, there were none ready to
consent to it.

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>DEPARTURE OF THE EMPEROR FROM THE CAPITAL.</head>
<p>On the fourteenth day of the seventh month <persName>Higo-no-kami
Sadayoshi</persName> with three thousand men under <persName>Kikuchi</persName>, <persName>Harada</persName>
and <persName>Matsuura</persName>, returned to <placeName>Kyōto</placeName> after having put down the
rebellion in <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName>. But though the revolt in <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> had
been quelled, that in the <placeName>North</placeName> and <placeName>East Country</placeName> was by no
means subdued. On the twenty second day at midnight a very
great tumult arose at <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. Horses were saddled, girths
were tightened, and people were running in all directions
carrying goods to hide them, while cries of: "The enemy are
upon us! They are entering the city!" arose on every side.
When the dawn broke the reason was found to be as follows.
There was a certain warrior of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of <placeName>Mino</placeName> named
<persName>Sado-no-Emon-no-jō Shigesada</persName>, who in the war of Hogen had
<pb n="48" xml:id="p62-48"/>

captured <persName>Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo</persName> when he fled after the
fight at the Palace of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, and had as a
reward been raised from his office of Hyōye-no-jō to that of
Uemon-no-jō. As the result of this he was disliked by the rest
of his family, and lately had been making advances to the
<persName>Heike</persName>, and now he came riding to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> with the news
that <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> was advancing on the Capital at the head
of fifty thousand horsemen, and <persName>Tate-no-Rokurō Chikatada</persName>, one
of his captains, with <persName>Taiyu-bó Kakumei</persName>, the ready writer, had
ridden hotfoot to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, where the three thousand monks had
made common cause with them, and that the whole force was
now pressing on the Capital itself. When they heard this the
<persName>Heike</persName> were thrown into state of great confusion and sent
out bodies of men in all directions. A force of three
thousand horsemen under the command of <persName>Shin-Chūnagon
Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> and <persName>Hon-sammi-no-Chūjō Shigehira-no-Kyō</persName>
at once rode out to take up a position at <placeName>Yamashina</placeName>, while
<persName>Echizen-no-sammi Michimori</persName> and <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> went
to hold the bridge at <placeName>Uji</placeName> with two thousand, and <persName>Sama-no-kami
Yukimori</persName> and <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName> guarded the highroad
at <placeName>Yodo</placeName> with about a thousand. Meanwhile it was rumoured
that <persName>Jūrō Kurando Yukiie</persName> with several thousand men had
crossed the bridge at <placeName>Uji</placeName> and entered the city; that <persName>Yada-no-Hangwan Yoshikiyo</persName>, son of <persName>Mutsu-no-Shin-Hangwan Yoshi-
yasu</persName> had crossed over <placeName>Oyeyama</placeName>; and that the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of tle
provinces of <placeName>Settsu</placeName> and <placeName>Kawachi</placeName> had also risen in revolt and
were marching on the Capital from that direction. Then the
<persName>Heike</persName>, abandoning all hope of saving the city, recalled the
forces that they had sent out and all crowded together in one
place, quite at a loss to know what do no next.
</p>
<p>
As the Chinese saying goes;
"The Imperial Capital is a
place ever busy with fame and gain; after cockcrow it has no

rest." If this is so when it is quietly governed, what must it
be when all is confusion. Doubtless they would have liked
to flee to the innermost recesses of Mount <placeName>Yoshino</placeName>, but their
enemies were in possession of all the highroads and all the
provinces were hostile, so that they could only find refuge by
the sea.
</p>
<p>
As we read in the golden words of the <title>Hokke Sutra</title> ;
"In the <placeName>Three Worlds</placeName> there is no rest; it is even as a house
that had taken fire." Not otherwise was the state of the
Capital at his time. On the twenty-fourth day at dusk the
former <persName>Naidaijin Munemori-no-Kyō</persName> went to the <placeName>Ikedono</placeName> at
<placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> where <persName>Kenrei-mon-i.n</persName> was staying and said: "<persName>Kiso
Yoshinaka</persName> is coming up to attack the Capital with fifty
thousand horsemen, and has already arrived at <placeName>Higashi-
Sakamoto</placeName> in <placeName>Omi</placeName>, where the monks of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> have joined
him; we must stay here at all events, but as it would be most
unfortunate if either yourself or your august mother the
<persName>Nii-dono</persName> came to any harm, we think it best that you, with the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, should for a while retire to the
<placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>." "As affairs now are," replied the
<orgName>Empress</orgName>, "that will be perhaps the best plan"; and as she
spoke her feelings overcame her and she sobbed unrestrainedly
into the sleeve of her Imperial Robe. The <persName>Naidaijin</persName> also
moistened the sleeve of his Naoshi with his tears.
</p>
<p>
Now when the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> heard privately of this design of the
<persName>Heike</persName> to take him away to the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, he departed
secretly from his Place at midnight, attended only by <persName>Uma-no-
kami Suketoki</persName>, the son of <persName>Azechi-no Dainagon Suketaka-no-Kyō</persName>, and made an Imperial Progress by himself to some place
the whereabouts of which remained augustly unknown. And
no one was aware of it.
</p>
<p>
But among the <orgName>Heike</orgName> samurai was a certain shrewd
fellow named <persName>Kitsunai Saemon-no-jō Sueyasu</persName>, who was
accustomed to serve at the <persName>Hō-o's</persName> Palace, and on this night
also he was on guard there, and although he was at some
distance from the private apartments, he became aware, from
<pb n="50" xml:id="p64-50"/>

the sound of subdued weeping of the <persName>Ladies-in-waiting</persName>, and
other signs of agitation, that some extraordinary and distressing
event had occurred. On his enquiring what it was, they
told him that the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> had disappeared suddenly, and
must have taken his august departure somewhere or other,
whereupon he went off in great haste to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and
reported the matter to <persName>Munemori-no-Kyō</persName>. The Minister at
first thought he must be mistaken, but on himself going.
to the Palace he learnt that the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was indeed not to
be found. The Ladies in attendance on His Majesty, the
<persName>Nii-dono</persName>, <persName>Tango-dono</persName> and others, were all aghast and helpless
with consternation, and there was not a single one of them who
knew whether he had gone, so <persName>Munemori</persName> could do nothing but
return weeping to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
When it was known that the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was no longer in the
city the excitement was extraordinary, and the flurry and
confusion of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> was such that it seemed that it could
have hardly been greater if the enemy had actually been
entering the houses of the Capital. As they had thus made
preparations to send the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> to the <placeName>Western
Provinces</placeName> and then found that their plan was already upset,
they felt like one who takes refuge under a tree that does not
keep off the rain. However they determined to carry out their
design in the case of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> at least, so at the hour of the
Hare (6 a.m.) the Imperial Palanquin was made ready, His
Majesty being at this time a child of six years old, and knowing
nothing of what was taking place. His Imperial Mother
<persName>Kenrei-mon-in</persName> rode also in the same Palanquin. <persName>Hei-Dainagon
Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName> had given orders that all the Treasures of the
Imperial House should be taken with them, the Sacred Jewel,
the Sword, the Mirror, the Imperial Seal and Key, the <term>Tablet
for marking the hours</term>, and the Imperial Biwa and Koto, but
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><term>Tablet for marking the hours</term>. Used for announcing to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> the
time of day, which was calculated by a water-clock.</note>
<p><pb n="51" xml:id="p65-51"/>

such was the flurry and excitement that many of them were left
behind. His Majesty's own sword was also forgotten in the
hurry. <persName>Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName> and his two sons <persName>Kura-no-kami
Nobumoto</persName> and <persName>Sanuki-no-Chujo Tokisane</persName> accompanied the
procession in full court robes, while the Imperial Guard of the
<persName>Konoe-tsukasa</persName> and the <persName>Mitsuna-no-suke</persName> escorted them in
armour, carrying their bows and quivers. So they proceeded
along the <placeName>Shichijō</placeName> to the west and the <placeName>Shujaku</placeName> to the south.
</p>
<p>
Thus the dawn began to break on the twenty-fifth day of
the seventh month; the light of the stars faded out, and the
clouds spread shelving over the eastern hills as the cocks
crowed clamourously. Of such a departure from the Capital
as this they had never even dreamed, though, when they
thought of it, the rash and hasty change of the capital the year
before seemed like a precedent. The <persName>Sesshō</persName> also followed the
Imperial train, and when they came to <placeName>Shichijo Omiya</placeName> a
beautiful youth with bound-up hair was seen to speed along in
front of the Imperial Car. On the left sleeve of his dress were
the characters 'Haru-no-hi' or 'Spring day'; and as these
two characters are also read '<placeName>Kasuga</placeName>', it seemed to them that
<persName>Kasuga Daimyōjin</persName>, the Divine Guardian of the <term>Hossō Sect</term>,
had come to protect the descendant of <persName>Fujiwara Kamatari</persName> the
great founder of his shrine. As they were giving thanks for
this supernatural aid, it seemed that the divine youth spoke the
following verse:
</p>
<lg type="romaji">
<l>"Ika ni sen Fuji no Uraha no kare yuku wo,</l>
<l>Tada haru no hi ni makasetara nan."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Though we cannot prevent the leaves of the Fuji from fading,</l>
<l>Let them fade at my will, in the bright sunshine of spring."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Then the <persName>Sesshō Motomichi</persName> called <persName>Shin-dozaemon-no-jō Taka-
nao</persName> who was in attendance on him, and said in a low tone:
"This may be called an Imperial Progress, but when we
consider the state of affairs it is no Imperial Progress but a
<pb n="52" xml:id="p66-52"/>

pitiful Imperial Parting, and what hope is there for the future?"
At this <persName>Takanao</persName> made a sign to the ox-drivers, and they,
understanding, whipped up their animals so that their car
dashed along the <placeName>Omiya</placeName> highroad at a great speed, and at
length they entered the temple of <placeName>Chisoku-in</placeName> at the foot of the
northern hills.

<head>FLIGHT OF KOREMORI FROM THE CAPITAL.</head>
<p><persName>Etchū Jirō-hyōye</persName>, seizing his sword, tried to stop the
<persName>Sesshō</persName> from running away in this manner, but he was held
back by the others and so was able to dɔ nothing. Among
them <persName>Komatsu-no-sammi Chūjō Koremori</persName> had long, made up
his mind that something of this sort was likely to come to pass,
but now that it had actually happened he was none the less
grieved. His wife was the daughter of the late <persName>Naka-no-Mikado Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyō</persName>, and as her father
and mother had both died, as has been already related, she was
an orphan. She was a lady of peerless beauty; her com
plexion was like a peach-blossom wet with dew, her large dark
eyes were soft and blandishing, and her long black hair swayed
about her like willow shoots in the wind. She had two
children, a son of ten years old named <persName>Rokudai</persName> and a little
daughter of eight, and they all clung about <persName>Koremori</persName> and
begged with tears to be allowed to accompany him. "But "
explained he, "I must go down with the rest of the men to the
<placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, and the foe are besetting the roads so it is
not likely we shall get through without danger. If I am killed,
however, there is no need for you to become a nun; it would
be better to look out for another husband and so bring up the
two children. In this world kind hearted people are not
lacking." But though he tried to comfort her thus, she would
not heed, and when the <persName>Chujo</persName> was just about to start she clung
to his sleeve crying out; "Alas! I have now no father or
<pb n="53" xml:id="p67-53"/>

mother in this city, and although you give me permission to
marry again after you have left me, it does not seem kind but
hateful. From connexion in the former life it is that people
are kind or that they receive compassion. You often said that
we would never part, but that we should both melt into the
dew of the same moor, or sink to the bottom of the same
water. Ah! it was not true, it was but the babbling of a
lover in the night-time. If I am left behind here what am I to
do? Can you bear to desert me when you know how I shall
suffer? And who is to look after these little children?
Though we may vex you, I pray you, do not leave us thus."
"In truth" replied the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, in accents of mingled affection
and impatience, "ever since you were thirteen and I fifteen we
have looked forward to being together until death should
separate us, until the same fire or water should enfold our
bodies; but now, since we have fallen on these evil days, I
must put on my armour and go forth to battle, and how could
I bear that you should accompany me to face the unknown
perils and hardships of a doubtful campaign? But, though
there is no place for you with me now, I will send and fetch
you as soon as we gain the security of some favourable coast."
Speaking thus decisively he went out into the verandah by the
middle gate and put on his armour, and calling for his horse
was just about to mount and ride away, when his little son and
daughter ran out and caught hold of the sleeves and skirts of
his armour, crying: "Father! where are you going? Please
take us too! Let us go with you!" As they thus wept and
clung round him, he could not for the moment tear himself
away, and while he was meditating over the hampering ties of
this world, his five younger brothers, <persName>Sammi-no-Chūjō Sukemori</persName>,
<persName>Sa-Chūjō Kiyotsune</persName>, <persName>Shōshō Arimori</persName>, <persName>Tango-no Jijū Tadafusa</persName>,
and <persName>Bitchu-no-kami Moromori</persName>, rode into the courtyard, reined
in their horses, and called out loudly: "The Imperial Train
has gone on a long way; why are you so long in coming"?
Then the <persName>Chūjō</persName> tore himself away and sprang on to his horse
<pb n="54" xml:id="p68-54"/>

to follow them, but again they called to him, so he drew his
horse to the edge of the verandah and with the tip of his bow
pushed up the bamboo curtain that hung before it, disclosing
his children to his brothers outside. 'You see how these little
ones twine round me; it is this that has delayed me until
now"; and as he spoke his feelings overcame him and the
tears ran down his face, so that those in the courtyard were
moved to weep in sympathy till the sleeves of their armour
were we's with tears
</p>
<p>
Now there were two samurai in the train of the <persName>Chūjō</persName>
named <persName>Saitō Go</persName> and <persName>Saitō Roku</persName>, two brothers, the elder of
whom was nineteen years old and the younger seventeen, and
they took hold of the bit of the horse on each side and said:
"Wherever you may go we will follow you"; "Ah", replied
the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, "I remember when your father <persName>Nagai-no-Saitō
Bettō Sanemori</persName> went to the <placeName>North Country</placeName> you wanted to go
with him, but he prevented you and went to his death there
alone. It seems as if he knew beforehand that you would be
needed here. Now I have to leave <persName>Rokudai</persName> behind, and I
have no one but you two with whom to entrust him. So,
though it may seem unreasonable, I must bid you stay behind."
The two brothers, therefore, repressing their tears of dis
appointment, could do nothing but comply with the orders of
their lord. As <persName>Koremori</persName> rode away his lady cried out:
"Never till now did I think that his heart would be so hard";
and she covered her face and fell prone on the ground. The
children and the ladies of the household, r.aching out beyond
the curtain, lifted up their voices and wept aloud, and the sound
echoed in the ears of the <persName>Chūjō</persName> until it was drowned by the
roar of the wind and waves of the <placeName>Western Sea</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
When the <orgName>Heike</orgName> fled from the Capital they set fire to all
their mansions, and <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>, <placeName>Ikedono</placeName>, <placeName>Komatsudono</placeName>, <placeName>Hachijō</placeName>,
<placeName>Nishi-Hachijō</placeName> and others, in all twenty mansions, beside some
forty or fifty thousand houses of their retainers in the city and
in <placeName>Shirakawa</placeName>, went up in flames.

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>THE IMPERIAL HAUNTS.</head>
<p>Thus the places that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> used to frequent were
reduced to ashes, and nought but the foundation stones was left
of his residences; the Imperial Car was his only refuge. Of
the gardens of the <persName>Princesses</persName> but the site remains, and on the
place of their elegant chambers the dew falls like tears and the
blasts whine mournfully. The splendid apartments where the
ladies tired themselves behind the long curtains, the
huntinglodges and fishing-pavilions, the residence of the <persName>Sesshō</persName>, the
mansions of the <persName>Courtiers</persName>, the labour of many years made vain
in an hour, what now remains of them but charred logs?
How much more the lodgings of their retainers and the houses
of the common people? In all the area that the fire devoured
was a score of cho and more. Not otherwise, when the power
of <placeName>Go</placeName> was overthrown, the terraces of <placeName>Kōso</placeName> were suddenly
abandoned to the thistles and dew, and when the might of <placeName>Shin</placeName>
was at last laid low, the smoke of the palace of <placeName>Kanyō</placeName>
obscured the land. Though the slopes of the pass of <placeName>Kwan-
koku</placeName> were made strong, the northern barbarians broke through,
and though they relied on the deep waters of the <placeName>Yellow river</placeName>
the eastern marauders took possession of it. What then are
we to think of it? Thus driven out of their elegant Capital
and forced to seek refuge in an unknown shore; it is as if the
<persName>Dragon God</persName>, who yesterday, rode in triumph on the clouds,
commanding the rain, should to-day lie like a fish out of water
beside the storehouses. So can all see that adversity and
prosperity take the same road, and rise and fall are as a turn of
the hand; and who is there who does not grieve? Though in
the former days of Hogen they flourished like the flowers in
spring time, in this era of Ju-ei they have fallen like the leaves
of autumn.

<p>
At this time <persName>Hatakeyama Shōji Shigeyoshi</persName>, <persName>Oyamada
Bettō Arishige</persName> and <persName>Utsunomiya Saemon Tomotsuna</persName>, who had

been in the service of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> from Jishō to Ju-ei, were lying
under sentence of death in the Capital, but <persName>Shin Chūnagon
Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> gave his opinion as follows: "It will
hardly make any difference to the fate of our house if the heads
of a hundred or a thousand men are cut off, so why cause
bereavement to the wives and children of these men who are
waiting for them at home? It may be against reason to say
so, but if our fortunes should again revive, they may come up
to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> and enter our service again to show us some gratitude
for our clemency." "Then let it be as you say "; said the
<persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>, and he set them free. Overjoyed at their
unexpected release, they raised their heads and put their hands
together, crying: "Let us share the fortunes of your house
to the end"; but <persName>Munemori</persName> replied: "Your hearts are in the
<placeName>East Country</placeName> with your families; why should you go with us
to the West, empty-handed as we are? Return, then, to your
homes." And they went out, finding it hard to restrain their
tears when they thought of those whom they had served for
twenty years.

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>DEPARTURE OF TADANORI FROM KYOTO.</head>
<p><persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName>, who had already left the Capital,
wishing to see <persName>Gojō-no-sammi Shunsei-no-Kyō</persName> once again, rode
back again to the city with a small train of five retainers and a
page, all, like himself, in full armour. When he came to the
gate of the mansion, however, he found it shut fast, and even
when he called his name, it was not opened, though there was a
sound of people running about within crying out that one of
the fugitives had returned. Then <persName>Satsuma-no-kami</persName> hastily
dismounted from his horse and himself cried out with a loud
voice: "It is I, <persName>Tadanori</persName>, who have come; I have something
to say to <persName>Sammi-dono</persName>; if you will not open the gate; at least
beg him to come forth here that I may speak with him."
"If
<pb n="57" xml:id="p71-57"/>

it is indeed <persName>Tadanori</persName>," relied <persName>Shunsei-no-Kyō</persName>, “you need have
no fear, but admit him." Then they opened the gate and
he entered, and the meeting between the two was most moving
and pathetic. "Ever since I became your pupil in the art of
poetry years ago," said <persName>Tadanori</persName>, “I have never forgotten you,
but for the last few years the disorder of the Capital and the
risings in the provinces have prevented me from coming to see
you. Now the final scene in the fall of our house hurries on
apace, and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> has already departed from the Capital.
But there is one thing that I very greatly desire. Some time
ago I heard that an Anthology of Poems was to be made by the
Imperial Command, and I wished to ask if you would
condescend to submit one of my poor verses for consideration,
that my name may be remembered in time to come; and I felt
great regret when the Collection was postponed owing to the
unsettled state of the country. If, however, at some time in
the future, when peace is restored to the Empire, this
Anthology should be made, I would beg your favour for one
of the stanzas in this scroll, that my spirit may rejoice under
the shade of the long grass, and from that far-off world may
come and aid you." And with these words he drew out from
beneath the sleeve of his armour a scroll containing a hundred
verses that he considered to be the best he had so far composed
and handed them to <persName>Shunsei-no-Kyō</persName>. "Truly does this
memento show that you have not forgotten me,” replied <persName>Shunsei</persName>
as he opened and perused it, "and I find it hard to keep back
my tears when I think of the manner of your coming. Verily
the sadness of it is unutterable and your affection to me most
deep." "Whether my bones will bleach on the hills or my
name be echoed by the billows of the <placeName>Western Sea</placeName>, I care not,"
answered <persName>Tadanori</persName>, "for I feel no regret for this fleeting
world; and so, as it must be, farewell;" and he sprang upɔn
his horse, and, replacing his helmet on his head, rode away to
the westward. <persName>Sammi-dono</persName> stood looking after him a long
while until he was out of sight, and as he looked the words of
<pb n="58" xml:id="p72-58"/>

the following Chinese verse were borne back to his ears in the
voice, as it seemed, of <persName>Tadanori</persName> :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Far is the road I must travel; so do I gallop into the evening mists of <placeName>Ganzan</placeName>.”</l>
</lg>
<p>
Overcome by his melancholy thoughts, <persName>Shunsei</persName> controlled his
feelings with difficulty as he slowly returned to his mansion.
</p>
<p>
In after days, when the Empire was once more at peace,
an Imperial Order was issued to make an Anthology called the
<title>Senzai-shū</title>, and <persName>Shunsei</persName> remembered the request of <persName>Tadanori</persName>
and his conversation, but though there were many verses.
worthy of immortality in the scroll that he had written, as at
that time he and all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been declared to be rebels
against the Throne, all that he could do for the memory of his
unhappy disciple was to include one of them under the title of
"A flower of my native land," by "An unknown author.”
The stanza runs thus:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though desolation has stricken the City of rippling wavelets,</l>
<l>Still does the cherry tree put forth its blossoms of yore."</l>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>DEPARTURE OF TSUNEMASA FROM KYOTO.</head>
<p><persName>Kōgō-gu-no-suke Tsunemasa</persName>, the eldest son of <persName>Shuri-no-
taiyū Tsunemori</persName>, had, as a child, served as page to the <persName>Imperial
Abbot</persName> of the temple of <placeName>Omuro Ninnaji</placeName>, and still felt so deeply
attached to him that he determined to pay him a farewell visit,
even in spite of their great haste; so he took five or six
retainers with him, and, riding off thither at great speed,
hurriedly alighted from his horse and knocked at the gate.
"Our Sovereign has already departed from the Capital," he
said, "and the doom of our house is at hand, but all I regret
in this fleeting world is that I must part from my lord.
Since I first entered this Palace cloister at the age of eight
until my Gempuku at the age of thirteen, except for a slight.
<pb n="59" xml:id="p73-59"/>

interval of sickness, never did I leave my lord's side; but
to-day, alas, I must go forth to the wild waves of the <placeName>Western
Sea</placeName>, not knowing when, if ever, I shall return. So I have
come, wishing to see his face more, though I feel ashamed to
enter his presence in this rough soldier's garb." When he
heard this, the <persName>Imperial Abbot</persName>, moved with compassion, replied:
"Bid him, enter as he is, without changing his dress."
<persName>Tsunemasa</persName> was that day attired in a hitatare of purple brocade
and body armour laced with green silk. A gold-mounted
sword hung at his side and a quiver of twenty four arrows with
black and white feathers at his back, and under his arm he
carried his bow of black lacquer with red binding. Taking off
his helmet and hanging it from his shoulder, he reverently
entered the little garden before the apartment of the <persName>Abbot</persName>.
His Reverence immediately appeared and bade them raise the
curtain before the verandah, on which he invited <persName>Tsunemasa</persName> to
be seated. When <persName>Tsunemasa</persName> had seated himself he beckoned
to <persName>Tōhyōye-no-jō Arimori</persName> who attended on him, and he brought
a bag of red brocade containing his master's Biwa, which
<persName>Tsunemasa</persName> laid before the <persName>Abbot</persName>. "I have brought back this
famous Biwa '<persName>Seizan</persName>,' which Your Reverence presented to me
last year, with deep regret, for it is not proper that I should'
take such a thing, one of the most precious treasures of our
land, into the rude wilds of the country. May I then deposit
it with Your Reverence, that if a happier day should perchance
dawn again for our family, and we should return to the Capital,
I may receive it from your hand once more?" At this the
<persName>Abbot</persName> was much moved and replied with the following stanza :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"So will I keep it unopened, this much regretted memento,</l>
<l>Just as though the bag held the affection you feel."</l>
</lg>
<p>
<persName>Tsunemasa</persName>, borrowing his master's inkstone, then wrote the
following:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though the water may cease to flow from this spout in your garden,</l>
<l>Never will cease my desire here to remain by your side.'</l>
</lg>
<p>
<pb n="60" xml:id="p74-60"/>

When he had said farewell and retired from the presence
of the <persName>Imperial Abbot</persName>, all those who were living in the
monastery, acolytes, monks, and priests of all ranks, flocked
round him, clinging to his sleeves and bedewing them with
their tears, so sad were they at parting with him. Among
them was a certain young priest named <persName>Dainagon-no-Hoshi
Gyökei</persName>, a son of <persName>Hamuro-no-Dainagon Mitsuyori-no-Kyō</persName>, who
had been much attached to him ever since his boyhood; and
he was so loath to part with him that he went to see him off as
far as the banks of the <placeName>Katsuragawa</placeName>, where he bade him
farewell, and returned to the monastery. As he parted with
him, weeping he composed the following verse :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Ah, how sad is this life, both the gnarled old tree and the cherry,</l>
<l>All must fade and pass; never a flower is left."</l>
</lg>
<p>
To which <persName>Tsunemasa</persName> made reply:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"In this passing world, each night that we lie down to slumber</l>
<l>Is as a traveller goes farther and farther away."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Then his samurai, who had been waiting in groups here
and there, unfurled their red banners and formed into a
company of about a hundred horsemen in all, and as he took
his place at their head they all whipped up their horses and
galloped on after the Imperial Procession.

<head>CONCERNING 'SEIZAN.'</head>
<p>It was when he was seventeen years old that <persName>Tsunemasa</persName>
was presented with the Biwa '<persName>Seizan</persName>,' and about the same time
he was sent as Imperial Envoy to the shrine of <persName>Hachiman</persName> at
<placeName>Usa</placeName>. When he arrived there he played certain secret pieces of
great beauty on it before the abode of the deity, and all the
</p>
<p><pb n="61" xml:id="p75-61"/>

assembled priests were so touched that the sleeves of their
ritual garments were wet with their tears. Even those without
any discrimination, who had never had any opportunity of
hearing good music, were delighted, thinking it sounded like
showers of rain. And the story of this Biwa is that, when in
the time of <persName>Nimmyō Tennō</persName>, in the third month of the third
year of the period of <term>Ka-shō</term>, <persName>Kamon-no-kami Sadatoshi</persName> went
to <placeName>China</placeName>, he learned three styles of playing from <persName>Renshō-bu</persName>,
a very renowned master of the Biwa, and before he
came back to <placeName>Japan</placeName> he was presented with three B'was
called '<persName>Genshō</persName>,' '<persName>Shishi-maru</persName>,' and '<persName>Seizan</persName>.' But while he
was returning over the sea, the <persName>Dragon god</persName> of the waters
was moved by envy to raise a great storm, so they cast
'<persName>Shishi-maru</persName>' into the waves to appease him, and brought
back only two to this country, which were presented to the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>.
</p>
<p>
Many years after, in the period <term>O-wa</term>, the <persName>Emperor
Murakami Tennō</persName> was sitting in the <placeName>Seiryō den</placeName> one autumn at
midnight, when the moon was shining brightly and a cool
breeze was blowing, and was playing on the Biwa called
'<persName>Genshō</persName>', when suddenly a shadowy form appeared before him
and began to sing in a loud and sonorous voice. On the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> asking him who he was and whence he had come, he
answered thus. "I am <persName>Renshō-bu</persName>, that master of the Biwa
who in <placeName>China</placeName> taught the three secret styles of playing to
<persName>Fujiwara Sadatoshi</persName>; but in my teaching there was one tune
that I concealed and did not transmit to him, and for this fault
I have been cast into the place of devils. Having this night
heard the wondrous beauty of your playing, I have come to
ask Your Majesty if I may transmit the one remaining tune to
you, and thus be permitted to enter the perfect enlighten ment
of <persName>Buddha</persName>." Then, taking '<persName>Seizan</persName>' which was standing before
His Majesty also, he tuned the strings and taught the melody
to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>. And this is that which is called '<term>Jogen</term>" and
'<term>Sekijo</term>.'
</p>
<p><pb n="62" xml:id="p76-62"/>

After this apparition the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and his Ministers feared
to play on this Biwa, and it was presented to the Imperial
Temple of <placeName>Ninnaji</placeName>, and <persName>Tsunemasa</persName> received it because he was
so much beloved by the <persName>Imperial Abbot</persName>. The front of it was
made of a rare wood called Shito, and on it was a picture of
the moon of dawn coming forth from among the green foliage
of summer mountains, hence its name '<persName>Seizan</persName>' (Green
Mountain). It was a most precious treasure not at all inferior
to <persName>Gensho</persName>.'

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>THE HEIKE ABANDON KYOTO.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Ike-no-Dainagon Yorimori-no-Kyō</persName> set fire to the
<placeName>Ikedono</placeName> Palace and set out from the city, but when he came to
the south <placeName>Toba</placeName> gate with his following of some three hundred
horsemen, they tore the red badges off their armour and
returned to the city on the pretext that they had forgotten
something. When <persName>Etchū-no-Jirō-hyōye Moritsugu</persName> perceived
this, he galloped off to <persName>Munemori</persName> with his bow in his hand and
said: "See there! A party of samurai, following the
example of <persName>Yorimori</persName>, has returned to the city, and their designs
look suspicious. I would respect the person of <persName>Yorimori</persName>, but
let me draw bow against these fellows."
"Under present
conditions," replied <persName>Munemori</persName>, "I think it would perhaps be as
well to pay no heed to such a pack of runagate knaves; but
have you seen or heard aught of the men of <persName>Komatsu-dono</persName>?"
"So far" answered <persName>Yorimori</persName>," none of them has yet come
up." "It is no good omen if people begin to desert us when
we have but left the Capital a single day;" reflected <persName>Munemori</persName>.
"I said it would be better to stay in the Capital, when every
other place is so uncertain;" said <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName>, casting a resentful glance at <persName>Munemori</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Now the reason why <persName>Yorimori</persName> stayed behind in <placeName>Kyoto</placeName>
was because <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had sent him many letters, swearing by
<pb n="63" xml:id="p77-63"/>

<persName>Hachiman</persName> that he would always regard him with the same
feeling as he had his late mother <persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName>, and had
given special orders to his army not to attack the samurai of
<placeName>Ikedono</placeName>; and so, though all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family were fleeing in
despair from the Capital, he alone remained behind, trusting
to the good-will of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>. As <persName>Saisho-dono</persName>, the wife of this
<persName>Yorimori</persName>, was the foster-mother of the <persName>Princess Hachijō-no-Nyoin</persName>, who had taken refuge in the <placeName>Tokiwa</placeName> mansion of the
temple of <placeName>Ninnaji</placeName> on account of the uproar in the Capital,
<persName>Yorimori</persName> also fled there for safety; for though he trusted to
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> to help him, the <persName>Nyoin</persName> was not entirely assured,
saying that in a world like the present no one knew what might
happen; for even if <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was friendly the attitude of the
other <persName>Genji</persName> was uncertain, and as they had thus rashly separated
from the rest of their family they were in a perilous position,
neither in the waves nor on shore.
</p>
<p>
So when the <persName>Courtiers of Komatsu-dono</persName>, the six sons of
<persName>Shigemori</persName> and their retainers, about a thousand men in all,
came up with the Imperial Procession by <placeName>Matsuda-kawara</placeName> at
<placeName>Yodo</placeName>, the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> was greatly rejoiced, and enquired
of them why they were so long in coming. "It is because I
was so long delayed by the affectionate pleadings of my little
ones," replied <persName>Koremori</persName>. "Then why did you not bring
<persName>Rokudai</persName> with you ? You are a hard-hearted father to be able
to leave him behind"; said <persName>Munemori</persName>. 'But when our
future is all uncertain like this" said <persName>Koremori</persName>, while the
tears ran down his face at such an unfeeling question.

<persName>Chūnagon-no-Risshi Chūkai</persName>, <persName>Kyċjū-bō-no-Ajari Yuen</persName>, while of
the Bushi, of Lords of manors, Kebiishi, Efu, and those in
various offices in the government, there were a hundred and
sixty. The total number amounted to some seven thousand
men, this being all that was left after the wars of the last few
years in the various provinces of the North and East. <persName>Hei
Dainagon Tokitada-no-kyō</persName>, stopping the Imperial Car at
<placeName>Yamasaki Sekito-no-in</placeName>, prostrated himself in the direction of
<placeName>Otokoyama</placeName> and prayed thus: "<persName>Namu Kimyō-chōrai Hachiman
Dai-Bosatsu</persName>, we beseech thee that thou wilt grant that Our
Lord the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and all our family may again return to the
Capital; "a most pathetic prayer indeed! And now, as they
looked back toward the city, nothing was to be seen but the
clouds of smoke from the burning buildings rising into the sky
like mist; in truth a melancholy sight. <persName>Hei Chūnagon Norimori</persName>
and <persName>Shuri-no-taiyu Tsunemori</persName> each composed a stanza on this
occasion, which run thus:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Ah! this fleeting life! Our Sovereign far from his Palace, sees it go up in smoke, rising aloft to the sky."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"When we look sadly back at the blackened plains of our homeland.</l>
<l>'tis as if we rode over an ocean of smoke."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Indeed we can imagine the sadness they felt when at the
same time they saw their homes reduced to ashes and smoke
and contemplated the long road they must travel. <persName>Higo-no-kami Sadayoshi</persName>, 
<pb n="65" xml:id="p79-65"/>

hearing that some of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> were at
<placeName>Kawajiri</placeName>, rode off with five hundred men to drive them away,
but, finding that the report was false, he was returning again to
the city when he fell in with the Imperial Procession near
<placeName>Udono</placeName>. Hastily alighting from his horse he sought the
presence of <persName>Munemori</persName>. After the customary obeisance he burst
forth : "What wretched plan is this? Whither are you
intending to go? If you are proceeding to the <placeName>Western
Provinces</placeName>, everyone will reproach you for taking to flight, and
it will be a disgrace to our family. It would be far better to
remain and await events in the Capital." "Perhaps you are
not yet aware," replied <persName>Munemori</persName>, "that <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>
is now advancing on the Capital with fifty thousand men, and
that the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> have occupied <placeName>Higashi Sakamoto</placeName>,
and that moreover the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> has disappeared during the night:
we were all ready to fight to the end in the Capital, but,
wishing to avoid all risk of danger to the <persName>Imperial Mother</persName> and
the <persName>Nii-dono</persName>, we thought it well to escort them into retirement
for a while in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> until the danger is
past." "In that case," answered <persName>Sadayoshi</persName>, "I will ask your
leave to return to the city and see what can be done;" and,
ordering his force of five hundred men to join the retainers of
<persName>Koremori</persName>, he rode back to <placeName>Kyoto</placeName> with only a small band of
thirty horsemen. Somehow or other the rumour spread that
<persName>Sadayoshi</persName> was returning to take vengeance on the <orgName>Heike</orgName> who
had stayed behind in the city, and when <persName>Ike-no-Dainagon
Yorimori</persName> heard it, he was greatly terrified for his own safety.
</p>
<p>
So <persName>Sadayoshi</persName> went and encamped on the burnt ruins of
<placeName>Nishi Hachijō</placeName>, and spent the night there, but not one of the
<persName>Heike</persName> Courtiers returned to bear him company. As solitude
and desolation reigned everywhere and the future seemed
ominous, he went to the grave of his master <persName>Shigemori</persName> and
dug out the bones that they might not be trodden under foot
by the horse-hoofs of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. Taking his place before the
bones as if they had been a living person, in a voice choked
<pb n="66" xml:id="p80-66"/>

with tears he addressed them thus: "Alas! how pitiable!
Behold the fate of your august house! Though it has been
said from of old time that the living must surely die, and that
at the height of pleasure comes pain, yet hard it is to behold
this doom with our own eyes. How happy that my lord,
knowing before what was about to take place, prayed to the
gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName> to shorten his life; and would that I,
<persName>Sadayoshi</persName>, had then accompanied him to the other world; for
now I have vainly lived thus long only that this affliction might
come upon me. I beseech you that, when I come to die, you,
my master, will come to meet me and guide me to the same
Buddha-land."
Thus weeping he communed with his master in
the far-off land, and then, sending the bones to <placeName>Kōya-san</placeName>, he
threw the earth of the tomb into the river <placeName>Kamo</placeName>, after which
he took his way in the opposite direction toward the <placeName>Eastern
Provinces</placeName>, thinking he could rely on <persName>Utsunomiya</persName> to assist him
in return for the kindness shown him by the <orgName>Heike</orgName> in former
years. Now all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> lords of high rank from <persName>Munemori</persName>
downwards, with the exception of <persName>Koremori</persName>, had taken their
wives and children with them, but as this was not possible with
those of lower rank, they had had to leave them behind in the
city, not knowing when they would see them again.. When-
ever people leave their family, even when the day and the hour
of their return are fixed exactly, the parting is always sad;
how much more on an occasion like this, when they took leave
of each other for perhaps the last time, were the sleeves of both
those who went and those who stayed moistened with their
tears. So old and young were fain to set forth, looking
backwards always with longing eyes, for how could they
forget the intimate ties of their ancestors or the benefits
themselves had enjoyed in later days? Some made the
journey by sea, braving the dangers of the troubled waves,
while others went by land; some on horseback and some
rowing in boats, each man leaving his home in the way he
thought best.

<head>THE HEIKE AT FUKUHARA.</head>
<p>When the <orgName>Heike</orgName> arrived at their former capital of <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, <persName>Munemori</persName> called together the most trusty retainers, old
and young, to the number of several hundred, and addressed
them thus: "Since the results of the good deeds of our house
are now exhausted and those of its evil actions predominate, we
have thus been abandoned by the gods and compelled to flee
the Capital, to wander like homeless vagrants, deserted even by
the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>. On whom then can we rely? Even when people
take shelter under the same tree, it is from some connexion in
a former life. and when they stoop to drink from the same
stream their Karma-relation is not slight, so you are not mere
casual dependants, but hereditary retainers of our house; some
bound by the ties of close relationship, some by gratitude for
the bounty of many generations. Let each of you consider
how many were the benefits he received in the days gone by, in
the time of the prosperity of our house, and will you not now
repay this favour? Moreover, seeing that we are escorting the
Sovereign possessing the Ten Virtues, and carrying with him
the Three Sacred Treasures, must we not stand by His Majesty
to the last, to the most inaccessible mountain or the remotest
plain?". Then his hearers, controlling their emotion, replied
with one voice: "When birds and animals know how to
repay kindness, how should we rational men forget it?' It is
the part of the warrior to be ashamed of double-dealing, and it
is but by the favour of the <orgName>Taira</orgName> house that for the last twenty
years we have supported our families. Therefore will we
follow our August Lord the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> even beyond the confines
of this Realm of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>, yea, even to <placeName>Kikai</placeName>, <placeName>Kōrai</placeName>, or <placeName>Keitan</placeName>,
to the farthest boundaries of sky and sea." At these words
<persName>Munemori</persName> and all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> felt some confidence return to them.
</p>
<p>
That night the exiles spent at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>. The sky was
clear and calm, and the bow-shaped new moon of autumn
<pb n="68" xml:id="p82-68"/>

shone brightly. As they lay on their grassy couches, in doubt
whether they should ever again behold this scene, their pillows
were damp with both dew and tears. When they looked
round upon the many buildings of the new capital that the
<persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName> had erected, the pavilion on the hill for
flower-viewing in springtime, the mansion by the sea for the
moon-viewing of autumn, the mansion of the bubbling spring,
the pavilion of the pine-tree shade, the resort for horse-racing,
the lofty palace of two stories, the snow-viewing palace, the
houses of the various retainers, the newly built Imperial Palace
which had been designed by <persName>Gōjō-Dainagon Kunitsuna-no-Kyō</persName>
with its glistening tiles and mosaic pavements, in the short
space of three years the roads were all thickly mossed and the
gates closed by the autumn grasses, while on the tiles the pines
were sprouting and ivy clustered thickly on the walls. Over
the mossy terraces only the pine-breeze blew ; the curtains were
gone and the bed-chambers lay open to view, but only the
moon beams cared to enter. The next day, after setting fire
to the Palace of <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, they escorted His Majesty to his
ship and all set sail. Though not as painful as when they left
the Capital behind, this parting also wrung their hearts with
grief. The smoky torches that were kindled by the fisherman ;
the calling of the deer at dawn at <placeName>Onoe</placeName>; the sound of the
waves beating on the shore; the shadows of the moon on their
long sleeves; the shrilling crickets among the grasses; every
sound and sight that fell on their eye and ear was melancholy,
and there was nothing that did not deepen their sorrow.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday they stood at the eastern frontier with ten myriads.
of horsemen; to-day they weigh anchor on the <placeName>western sea</placeName>
with but seven thousand followers. Calmly the clouds float
over the waves, and the blue sky slowly darkens; the evening
mist drifts over the lonely islets and the moon comes up over
the waters, and so the ships plough their way over the
boundless ocean toward their far-distant haven.
As the days pass
the Capital recedes farther and farther from
their vision and
<pb n="69" xml:id="p83-69"/>

has become as it were beyond the clouds. Even thoughts of
their far-off home did but cause fresh tears, the one thing that
seemed to have no end. When they saw a flock of white
seabirds swooping over the waves, they remembered the question
of <persName>Arihara-no-Narihira</persName> that he asked at the <placeName>Sumida</placeName> river, and
the beloved name <term>Miyako-dori</term>, or Bird of <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, held a
melancholy interest for them. It was on the twenty-fifth day
of the seventh month of the second year of Ju-ei that the
<persName>Heike</persName> fled from the Capital.

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>On the twenty fourth day of the seventh month of the
second year of Ju-ei at midnight, the <persName>Hōō</persName>, accompanied only
by <persName>Uma-no-kami Suketoki</persName>, the son of <persName>Azechi-no-Dainagon
Sukekata-no-Kyō</persName>, fled secretly from the Palace and escaped to
<placeName>Kurama</placeName>; but as the priests of the temple thought it was rather
too near to the Capital to be safe, he again removed, and, after
braving the hard and dangerous path over the mountains by
<placeName>Shino-no-mine</placeName> and <placeName>Yakuō-saka</placeName>, he arrived at the small temple
of <placeName>Jakujō-bō</placeName> at <placeName>Gedatsu-dani</placeName> at <placeName>Yokogawa</placeName>. When the priests
of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> heard of this, they pressed him to proceed to the
<placeName>Hall of the Eastern Pagoda</placeName> of <placeName>Enryakuji</placeName>, so His Majesty took
up his abode at <placeName>Minami-dani Enyū-bō</placeName>, which was forthwith
designated the <placeName>Imperial Palace</placeName>, and strictly guarded by their
monks and samurai. Thus the <persName>Hō-o</persName> fled from his Palace and
went to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> left the Palace of the
<placeName>Phoenix Gate</placeName> for the <placeName>Western Ocean</placeName>, while the <persName>Sesshō</persName> took
refuge in the recesses of <placeName>Yoshino</placeName>, and the Imperial Ladies
concealed themselves at <placeName>Hachiman</placeName>, <placeName>Kamo</placeName>, <placeName>Saga</placeName>, and <placeName>Uzumasa</placeName>,
and other remote places in the hills to the east and west of the
city. As the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had fled and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> had not yet entered,
the Capital was thus without a Lord, a thing that had never
been known from the beginning of time. In the book of the
Prophecies of <persName>Shōtoku Taishi</persName>, wonderful to relate, these things.
are written.
</p>
<p>
As soon as it was known that the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was holding his
Court on <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, all the former Courtiers and officials came
flocking round him: the former <persName>Kwampaku Motofusa</persName>, the
<persName>Sesshō Motomichi</persName>, the <persName>Dajo-daijin Moronaga</persName>, the <persName>Sadaijin</persName> and
</p>
<p><pb n="71" xml:id="p85-71"/>

<persName>Udaijin</persName> and <persName>Naidaijin</persName>, the <persName>Dainagon</persName> and <persName>Saishō</persName>, all the
<persName>Courtiers</persName> of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Ranks; everyone
who was anyone, and who desired place, office, or promotion,
presented himself; none were wanting. So great was the
number of those who crowded to the <placeName>Enyu-bō</placeName> that neither in
the upper or lower chambers, nor within or without the gate
was any vacant space at all to be found. Great was the
prosperity of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> through the presence of this Imperial
Abbot.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty eighth day of the same month the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>
deigned to return to the Capital. He was escorted by <persName>Kiso
Yoshinaka</persName> with fifty thousand horsemen, and <persName>Yamamoto-no-Kwanja Yoshitaka</persName> of the <persName>On Genji</persName> rode at the head of the
procession bearing the white banner of the <persName>Minamoto</persName>. It was
indeed a strange sight for the people of <placeName>Miyako</placeName> to see again the
white banner in their streets, where for more than twenty years
it had not waved. <persName>Jurō Kurando Yukiie</persName> with many thousand
horsemen crossed the <placeName>Uji</placeName> bridge and entered the Capital, while
<persName>Yada-no-Hangwan-dai Yosihikiyo</persName>, son of <persName>Mutsu-no-Shin Han-
gwan Yoshiyasu</persName>, entered it from <placeName>Oyeyama</placeName>. Besides these the
<persName>Genji</persName> of <placeName>Settsu</placeName> and <placeName>Kawachi</placeName> came in also from that
direction, so that the Capital was filled to overflowing with the
<persName>Genji</persName> warriors.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Kade-no-koji Chūnagon Tsunefusa-on-Ky5</persName> and
<persName>Kebiishi-no-Bettō Saemon-no-kami Saneie</persName> called <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>
and <persName>Yukiie</persName> to the verandah of the <persName>Hō-ō's</persName> Palace. <persName>Kiso</persName> was
wearing a suit of armour laced with Chinese brocade over a
hitatare of red silk, and a sword exquisitely ornamented with
gold and silver. His quiver held twenty four arrows with
black and white spotted feathers, and he carried a bow
of black lacquer with red binding, and he took off his helmet
and hung it from his shoulder-cord as he knelt down and
made low obeisance. <persName>Jurō Kurando Yukiie</persName> wore a hitatare of
dark blue brocade and his armour was laced with black, while
his sword was decorated in lacquer of the same colour. He
<pb n="72" xml:id="p86-72"/>

carried a quiver of twenty four arrows with white feathers
having a black bar across them, and his bow was lacquered
black over the binding. He too doffed his helmet and hung
it from his shoulder as he made his obeisance. Having been
bidden to subdue the former <persName>Naidaijin Munemori</persName> and all the
<persName>Heike</persName> family, they both again made obeisance and retired.
</p>
<p>
As they both intimated to the Court that they had no place to
lodge, <persName>Kiso</persName> was given the <placeName>Nishi-no-doin</placeName> in <placeName>Rokujo</placeName>, the
residence of <persName>Daizen-no-taiyu Naritada</persName>, while the <placeName>Southern Hall</placeName>
of the <placeName>Hojijiden</placeName> called the <placeName>Kaya Palace</placeName> was appointed for
<persName>Yukiie</persName>. The <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was exceedingly grieved that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
should have been thus rapt away by his maternal relations the
<persName>Taira</persName> Nobles, and that he should be tossed about on the waves
of the <placeName>Western sea</placeName>, and therefore sent his Imperial Command
to the West that they should immediately send him back with
the Three Sacred Treasures safe to the Capital. But the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
paid no heed.
</p>
<p>
Now there were three Princes, sons of the late <persName>Emperor
Takakura</persName>, beside the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, but as the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had also taken
the middle one with them in order to make him Crown Prince,
there were only two remaining in the Capital. So on the fifth
day of the eighth month the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> proceeded to the Palace
where they were being brought up. On his calling to him the
third Prince, aged five, the child began to cry in a fretful manner
so that the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> bade them take him away again, but when the
fourth son, who was then four years old, was brought into the
Imperial Presence, he immediately got upon the knees of the
<persName>Hō-ō</persName> and nestled up to him affectionately. The eyes of the
<persName>Hō-ō</persName> became filled with tears as he said: See how he comes
affectionately to an old monk like me that he does not know!
He is my grandson indeed; he is just like the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
when he was a child; I have never had such a charming
remembrance of him till now." Then <persName>Jōdōji-no-Nii-dono</persName>, who was
then known as <persName>Tango-dono</persName>, being in attendance on His Majesty
asked: "Is it then decided that this Prince shall be appointed
<pb n="73" xml:id="p87-73"/>

to succeed to the Throne?" To which the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> replied that
it should certainly be so. The oracles were then consulted
privately and the response was given that if the Fourth Prince
should succeed to the Throne his descendants would rule
<placeName>Nippon</placeName> for a hundred generations. The mother of this Prince
was the daughter of <persName>Shichijiō Shūri-no-taiyū Nobutaka-no-Kyō</persName>,
who was one of the Ladies-in-waiting of the <orgName>Empress</orgName>, and had
been much favoured by the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, so that she had borne
him many children. This <persName>Nobutaka-no-Kyō</persName> had many
daughters and greatly wished that one of them might become
an Imperial Consort, and having heard that if anyone kept a
thousand white fowls he would certainly have a daughter who
would become Imperial Consort, he provided himself with a
thousand white birds forthwith, and perhaps this was the reason
that his daughter bore so many Princes. <persName>Nobutaka</persName> was
extremely pleased in his heart, but as he feared the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and
was anxious about the <roleName>Empress</roleName> he did nothing about them, but
<persName>Hachijō no-Nii-dono</persName>, the wife of <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, reassured him,
saying that there was nothing to fear, and that she would herself
see to their bringing-up and would make one of them Crown
Prince. So she provided many milk-nurses for them and had
them under her care. So it happened that this Fourth Prince
was adopted by the elder brother of the <persName>Niidono</persName>, <persName>Hōshōji-no-Shugyo Nōen Hōin</persName>, and this <persName>Hōin</persName> went down with the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
to the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, leaving his wife and the child in
the Capital.
</p>
<p>
Soon afterwards, however, he sent a messenger, from
thence asking her to bring the little Prince to him,
and his wife, much rejoiced, started out with him and had
gone as far as <placeName>West Shichijō</placeName>, when her elder brother,
<persName>Kii-no-kami Norimitsu</persName>, stopped her, saying that it was
a foolish thing to do, for now fortune was likely to favour the
little Prince; and it was on the next day the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> came to see
him. On this account <persName>Norimitsu</persName> expected that he would be
appointed to some office, but time went on and his wishes were
<pb n="74" xml:id="p88-74"/>

not realized, so at last in his disappointment he wrote these two
v rses and sent them to the Court:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Does not the cuckoo sing at least one note of remembrance, of the midnight glade where he was nurtured of old?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Pity the poor tomtit, for lonely if free in the mountains, much he envies the day when he was still in his cage."</l>
</lg>
<p>
The <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, who had not till then thought of the
condition of <persName>Norimitsu</persName>, was touched by his case and promoted him
to the Upper Third Rank.

<p>On the tenth day <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> was appointed Sama-on-

<placeName>Echizen</placeName>, beside having the title of <persName>Asahi Shōgun</persName>, or <persName>Rising

was given that of <placeName>Iyo</placeName> instead, and <persName>Yukiie</persName> also, being
dissatisfied with <placeName>Bingo</placeName>, received <placeName>Bizen</placeName> in its place. Moreover
some ten more of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> were appointed captains of the

two sons, <persName>Kura-no-kami Nobumoto</persName> and <persName>Sanuki-no-Chūjō

were being frequently sent to these three officials to

to the Capital.

On the seventeenth day the <orgName>Heike</orgName> reached <placeName>Dazaifu</placeName> in the
district of <placeName>Mikasa</placeName> of the province of <placeName>Chikuzen</placeName>. <persName>Kikuchi-no-Jiro Takanao</persName>, who had gone down with them from the Capital,
now, under the pretext of going on in front to open the barrier
at <placeName>Otsuyama</placeName>, crossed over the province of <placeName>Higo</placeName> and retired into
his own stronghold, from which he did not come forth in spite
of repeated injunctions. Beside this, of all the men of the two
islands of <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> who were bidden to join the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, not one
appeared with the exception of <persName>Okura Tanenao</persName> of <placeName>Iwado</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
On the eighteenth day the <orgName>Heike</orgName> arrived at <placeName>Anrakuji</placeName>, where
the <persName>Courtiers</persName> spent the whole night in composing poems and
Renga. On this occasion <persName>Hon-sammi Chūjō Shigehira</persName> made
a verse that brought tears to the eyes of all :
</p>
<lg>
<l>One of the gods once knew the longing we feel for Miyako,</l>
<l>Parted like us from the land where for so long he had dwelt."</l>
</lg>

exiled to <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> and died there.</note>
<p>
On the twentieth day, by an Imperial Edict of the <persName>Hōō</persName>,
the Fourth Prince was proclaimed Emperor in the <placeName>Kan-in
Palace</placeName>. The <persName>Sessho</persName> remained as before, for <persName>Motomichi</persName>
continued in office, and the Chiefs of Departments and <persName>Kurando</persName>
also returned to their posts. The milk-nurse of the Third
Prince shed tears of regret, but it was of no avail.

"In heaven there are not two suns, and in a country there
are not two sovereigns;" is an ancient saying, but now,
through the evil deeds of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, there were two Emperors
one in the Capital and one in the country. In ancient times
<persName>Montoku Tennō</persName>, who died in twenty third day of the eighth
month of the second year of Ten-an, had many sons who
wished to succeed to the Throne, and who offered up prayers
in secret to that effect. The eldest, <persName>Prince Koretaka</persName>, who was

also called <persName>Prince Kinohara</persName>, was an exceedingly wise prince,
learned in all matters of importance to one who would govern
a country, and therefore seemed to all worthy of succeeding to
the Throne, but the second, <persName>Prince Korehito</persName>, was the son of
the <persName>Lady Some-dono</persName>, the daughter of the <persName>Kwampaku Fujiwara
Yoshifusa</persName>, and so had the support of the whole of the <persName>Fujiwara</persName>
family. It was thus a very difficult question to decide.
On
the one side was a wise and learned Crown Prince; on the
other a Minister most potent in all the affairs of state. Both
were much to be pitied, and everybody was greatly perplexed.
</p>
<p>
The priest who prayed for <persName>Prince Koretaka</persName> was <persName>Kaki-no-moto
Ki-Sōjō Shinzei</persName>, the greatest man in the temple of <placeName>Tōji</placeName>, and a
disciple of <persName>Kōbō Daishi</persName>, while on the side of <persName>Prince Korehito</persName>
was <persName>Eiryō Kwashō</persName> of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, the chaplain of the <persName>Kwampaku
Yoshifusa</persName>, a priest by no means inferior to him in any way.
Everyone said it would be difficult to settle the matter, and
when the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> died and a Council of Courtiers was held to
say who should succeed him, as all the Ministers maintained
each his own opinion and refused to listen to anyone else, the
deliberation became a mere wordy warfare, and at last it was
decided to settle it according to the result of a horse-race and a
wrestling match; the Throne to go to the side that was
successful. So on the second day of the ninth month both the
Princes proceeded in state to the race-course of <placeName>Ukon-no-baba</placeName>,
and all the <persName>Courtiers</persName> gathered there apparelled in their gayest
costumes, making a scene of unimaginable brilliance and
splendour. In two long lines on either side of the course the
supporters of each Prince were drawn up, with beating hearts
and hands clasped tightly together, anxiously awaiting the
result of this most unparalleled contest." Nor must the priests
and their prayers be passed over. <persName>Shinsei Sōjō</persName> set up his altar
at <placeName>Tōji</placeName>, while <persName>Eiryō Kwashō</persName> set up his at the temple of
<placeName>Shingon-in</placeName> within the Palace, and thinking that if it was
reported that he had died, <persName>Shinsei</persName> would relax his zeal
somewhat, <persName>Eiryō</persName> put it about that he was dead, while he
<pb n="77" xml:id="p91-77"/>

applied himself to his orisons with redoubled vigour. Then
the horse races began, and out of ten races the first four
were won by the elder <persName>Prince Koretaka</persName>, but the next six fell
to the party of <persName>Prince Korehito</persName>. After this the wrestling match
was held, and a certain <persName>Natora Uemon-no-kami</persName>, a doughty
champion who possessed the strength of sixty men, stood
forth on behalf of <persName>Prince Koretaka</persName>. On the side of the
younger Prince appeared <persName>Yoshio Shōshō</persName>, a small and delicate
looking man, who looked as if the other might throw him with
one hand. He was chosen, however, because the Prince had
had a supernatural dream in which he was bidden to select him.
</p>
<p>
So <persName>Natora</persName> and <persName>Yoshio</persName> faced each other, and after feinting a
little retired. Then they engaged again and <persName>Natora</persName>, gripping
<persName>Yoshio</persName>, lifted him off his feet and flung him a distance
of twenty feet away. But he came down on his feet and did
not fall to the ground. Then <persName>Yoshio</persName> in his turn sprang at
<persName>Natora</persName> and tried to throw him, but owing to the great size of
his opponent he was in danger of being borne down from
above, and seemed about to be overcome. On seeing this, a
crowd of the retainers of <persName>Some-dono</persName>, the mother of the second
Prince, rushed to the Palace in a throng thick as the teeth of a
comb, and cried out : "Our side is like to lose; what shall we
do?" Then <persName>Eiryo Kwasho</persName>, who was repeating mystic
prayers and incantations of mighty efficacy, frenzied at their
failure, seized his <term>Tokko</term>, and, dashing his head open with it,
took some of his brains, pounded them and mixed them with
milk, and putting them in the sacred '<term>Goma</term>' fire, raised a
thick black smoke, wrestling so mightily in prayer that at last
<persName>Yoshio</persName> won the contest. Thus did the second <persName>Prince Korehito</persName>
succeed to the Throne, to be known thenceforth as <persName>Seiwa</persName>
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><term>Tokko</term>. The Vadjra or mace of Indra. Emblem of the power to destroy

<p><pb n="78" xml:id="p92-78"/>

<persName>Tenno</persName>, and afterwards also as <persName>Mizu-o-no-Tenno</persName>.
And so
thereafter the priests of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> would often say; "When
<persName>Eiryō</persName> dashed out his brains the second son was made Emperor,
and when <persName>Son-i</persName> wielded the sword of wisdom the curse of
<persName>Tenjin</persName> was overcome." Thus we may understand the power
of the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName>, but beside that everyone considered
that it was according to the will of <persName>Tensho-daijin</persName>.

<head>THE EMPEROR PROCEEDS TO USA.</head>
<p>When the <orgName>Heike</orgName> in <placeName>Tsukushi</placeName> heard of this, they all
exclaimed: "Ah, if we had only brought the third and fourth
Princes with us also!" "Even if we had done so," said <persName>Hei
Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName>, "there is the son of <persName>Prince
Takakura</persName> whom his guardian <persName>Sanuki-no-kami Shigehide</persName> made
a monk and brought to the <placeName>North Country</placeName>; for <persName>Kiso
Koshinaka</persName> has had his vows revoked and brought him with him
to the Capital with the intention of placing him on the Throne.”
But the others objected, saying: "How is it possible for a
Prince whose vows have been revoked to succeed to the
Throne ?" 'Of a surety it is possible," replied <persName>Tokitada</persName>,
"for in other countries there are precedents for it, and in this
country also, when <persName>Temmu Tennō</persName> was Crown Prince, he was
attacked by <persName>Prince Ōtomo</persName> and cut off his hair and retired to
Mount <placeName>Yoshino</placeName>; but after <persName>Prince Ōtomo</persName> had been overthrown
he came back again and ascended the Throne. <persName>Kōken Tennō</persName>
also was moved by the Buddha-mind to lay aside his dignity
and become a recluse, changing his name to <persName>Hokini</persName>, but
afterwards he resumed the Throne as <persName>Shōtoku Tennō</persName>.
Therefore there is no reason why <persName>Kiso</persName> should not make this
Prince Emperor in spite of his revoked vows."
</p>
<p>
On the third day of the ninth month an envoy was sent to
<placeName>Ise</placeName> from the Court. He was the <persName>Sangi Naganori</persName>. There
have been three examples of <persName>Retired Emperors</persName> sending envoys
<pb n="79" xml:id="p93-79"/>

to <placeName>Ise</placeName>, namely the <persName>Emperors Shujaku</persName>, <persName>Shirakawa</persName> and <persName>Toba</persName>;
but in their case it was done before they became recluses; so
that this is the first example of sending one after retirement.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Heike</persName> thought to establish a capital in <placeName>Tsukushi</placeName>, and
a Council of Courtiers was held, but they could not decide the
matter.
The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was then residing at the house
of <persName>Okura-no-Tanenao</persName> of <placeName>Iwado</placeName>, while the others lodged
among the fields and farms: though they did not wear
garments of hemp, as the poet says, yet they certainly lived
in a rustic way.
As the Palace was thus in the wilds, it
was but a Log-Palace, but even so there was something
about it that was most dignified. So the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> again
proceeded to the shrine of <placeName>Usa</placeName>. Here the apartments
of the <persName>Dai guji</persName> served as the Imperial Lodging, while the
<persName>Courtiers</persName> lived in the main building of the shrine, and the
officials of the fifth and sixth ranks in the side galleries. Around
them in the courtyard were encamped the samurai of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName>
and <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> in serried ranks of mail-clad warriors. The
ancient vermilion of the shrine-fence seemed to
renew its
youthful brilliance at the unwonted honour. After sleeping
seven nights in the shrine the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> had a dream.
The doors of the Inner Shrine opened and in a mighty voice
these words boomed forth:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Are not these painful misfortunes a sign of the anger of heaven?</l>
<l>Why then do you thus earnestly pray to the gods?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
<persName>Munemori</persName>, confounded and cast into the depths of gloom
and anxiety, murmured to himself the words of the ancient
verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>Thinking of this my heart, in tune with the voice of the insects,</l>
<l>Feebler and feebler grows; autumn is waning indeed.</l>
</lg>
<p>
So they returned to <placeName>Dazaifu</placeName>. It was now about the tenth
day of the ninth month. The evening blasts howled over the
Hagi leaves, and as they slept in their day garments their
<pb n="80" xml:id="p94-80"/>

sleeves were wet with tears, so hard to endure was this rough
journey in the dreary days of fading autumn. The moon of
the thirteenth day of the ninth month was the famous moon of
autumn, but as they thought of their present state, and
remembered the moon as it shone on the Court in their <placeName>Ancient
Capital</placeName> in the days of their grandeur, their eyes grew blurred
so that they could only behold it through a mist. On this
occasion <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName>, <persName>Shuri-no-taiyu Tsunemori</persName>,
and <persName>Kōgō-gū-no-suke Tsunemasa</persName> made these three stanzas:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Those with whom last year we viewed the moon at <placeName>Miyako</placeName></l>
<l>On this self-same night, fondly are thinking of us,"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"This is the moon that last year we gazed at together, beloved</l>
<l>Recollections of you hover about me to-night."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Here the dew never dries on these sad fields of our exile.</l>
<l>On what undreamed of shore come we to gaze on the moon."</l>

<p>The province of <placeName>Bungo</placeName> was the fief of <persName>Gyōbu-kyō Sammi

informing him that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been forsaken by the powers

<placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> should neither receive them, nor have any dealings
with them, and the province of <placeName>Bungo</placeName> should cast off its

<note type="gloss" place="bottom">There is a variant of the story of this Japanese Cupid and Psyche in

from whom it is said the family of <persName>Ogata</persName> derived their descent. <placeName>Takachiho</placeName>

made known to <persName>Ogata Saburō Koreyoshi</persName>; now of this <persName>Kore-
yoshi's</persName> ancestry a fearsome story was told. In a certain
mountain village of the province of <placeName>Bungo</placeName>, there lived in
ancient days a man who had an only daughter, and though she
was not yet married, someone used to visit her every night, so
that in the course of time she became pregnant. Her mother,
thinking this strange, asked her what kind of a person it was
that came to her. I only see him come, "said the maiden,
but I never know when he returns." "In that case" replied
the mother, "fasten something to him, and tie a thread to it
that we may know." So the damsel, in obedience to her
mother's behest, stuck a needle into the collar of the light-blue
Kariginu that her lover wore, to which was affixed the end of
a ball of thread. Following this to see where it led, the girl
and some companions crossed right over the province of
<placeName>Bungo</placeName> until they came to the borders of <placeName>Hyūga</placeName>. There they
found that it went into the mouth of a great cave at the foot of
a peak called <placeName>Uba-ga-take</placeName>. Then the girl, standing at the
mouth of the cave, cried out with a loud voice to the inmate :
"It is I, who have come thus far that I might look on your
face." At this, from the cave came forth the respon e:
"My form is no human shape, and if you saw it your senses
would depart with amazement The child you will bear will
be a son, and in the two islands of <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> there shall be none
to equal him with sword or bow." The girl, however, was
not convinced, and again addressed him: "Whatever form
you may have", she p'eaded, "if you have not forgotten our
long attachment, I pray you let me see you this once at least."
Then from out of the cave in an wer to her request there
crawled forth a monstrous snake, fourteen or fifteen feet long,
swaying and quivering as it came. The damsel swooned with
horror and surprise on seeing it, and the companions who had
accompanied her shrieked with fear and fled in all directions.
The needle that she had stuck in the collar of her lover was
seen to stick out from the windpipe of the snake.
</p>
<p><pb n="82" xml:id="p96-82"/>

The girl returned to her home and not long after was
delivered of a son, who was given to her grandfather to bring
up, and who grew so fast that before he was yet ten years old
he was huge of body and long of face. At the age of seven he
made his <term>Genpuku</term>, and was called <persName>Daida</persName> on account of his
grandfather whose name was <persName>Daidayū</persName>. As during both winter
and summer his hands and feet were covered with chaps, he
was nicknamed <persName>Chapped Daida</persName>. And this <persName>Daida</persName> was the
ancestor of <persName>Koreyoshi</persName> in the fifth generation; and since <persName>Kore-
yoshi</persName> was the descendant of such a formidable hero, when he
sent round the order of the Governor, saying that it was an
Edict of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, all the chief men in <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName>
obeyed him. And the monstrous serpent is said to be the
manifestation of the deity of <placeName>Takachiho</placeName> who is worshipped in
the province of <placeName>Hyūga</placeName>.

<head>THE FLIGHT FROM DAZAIFU.</head>
<p>Thus though the <orgName>Heike</orgName> proposed to establish a capital in
<placeName>Tsukushi</placeName> and build there an Imperial Palace, and a Council of
Courtiers was held to consider it, yet, on account of the hostile
attitude of <persName>Ogata Koreyoshi</persName>, the plan could not be carried
out. Then the <persName>Chunagon Tomomori</persName> gave his opinion thus :
"Seeing that this <persName>Ogata Koreyoshi</persName> was a retainer of the house.
of <persName>Shigemori</persName>, if one of that family were to go and see him.
something might be arranged." In accordance with this
advice, which they considered reasonable, <persName>Shin-sammi Chujō
Sukemori</persName> set forth with five hundred horsemen, and, crossing
the Province of <placeName>Bungo</placeName>, entered into negotiations with <persName>Kore-
yoshi</persName>; but, in spite of all his persuasions <persName>Ogata</persName> paid no heed,
but on the other hand drove them away again, saying: "I
ought to seize you all and make you prisoners, but in great
matters small things are nothing, so you had better go back to
<placeName>Dazaifu</placeName> and do what you please." A short time afterwards he
<pb n="83" xml:id="p97-83"/>

sent his second son <persName>Nojiri Jirō Koremura</persName> to <placeName>Dazaifu</placeName> with a
message, saying: "If the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were on the side of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>, we would certainly doff our helmets and loose our
bowstrings in submission, but the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> has ordered that
you are to be expelled from <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> at once." Then <persName>Hei
Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName>, clad in a hakama laced with
scarlet thread and a hitatare of grass-cloth, and wearing a lofty
eboshi on his head, advanced to meet <persName>Koremura</persName> and spake
thus: "Our <roleName>Emperor</roleName> is descended in the direct line from
forty nine generations of heavenly posterity, being the eighty
first Earthly Sovereign since <persName>Jimmu Tennō</persName>, therefore will
<persName>Tenshō-daijin</persName> and <persName>Hachiman Bosatsu</persName> protect our Lord from all
his enemies. Moreover our house has from Hogen and Heiji
to this day put down many rebellions, keeping the peace of the
Realm, and by our favour were all the officials of <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName>
appointed to their authority: but now, forgetting all the
gratitude they owe us, they have believed the promises of the
rebels of the East and North, <persName>Yoritomo</persName> and <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, that, if
they drive us out, they will receive many provinces and manors
as a reward, and so have meanly acted according to the
instructions of that 'big-nose <placeName>Bungo</placeName>'. (Now it was because
<persName>Gyōbu-Kyō Sammi Yorisuke</persName>, who held the fief of <placeName>Bungo</placeName>, had
such a large nose, that he was thus spoken of). <persName>Koremura</persName> then
returned and reported their answer to his father, who replied:
"It may be so, but old times are old times and the present is
the present, so now we must drive them out of <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName>."

<p>
Then, hearing that <persName>Koreyoshi</persName> was gathering his forces,
<persName>Gendaiyu Hangwan Suesada</persName> and <persName>Settsu Hangwan Morisumi</persName>,
exclaiming ; Now we are hindered even by our friends ; let
us go and smite them"; took with them three thousand
horsemen and, crossing over the province of <placeName>Chikugo</placeName>, met the
enemy at <placeName>Honjō</placeName> of <placeName>Takano</placeName> and fought with them for a day
and a night, but at last, owing to the great number of
<persName>Koreyoshi's</persName> men, were forced to retire.
</p>
<p><pb n="84" xml:id="p98-84"/>

Then the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, hearing that <persName>Koreyoshi</persName> was advancing to
attack them with thirty thousand men, fled in a panic from
<placeName>Dazaifu</placeName>, without stopping to take anything with them. Bidding
a reluctant farewell to the hospitable shrine of <persName>Tenjin</persName>, they
hurried away, and as there were no proper bearers for the
Imperial Phoenix Car, the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was borne in an
ordinary palanquin which was dignified with the name only.
His Imperial Mother and all the noble ladies of her train had
perforce to gather up the long skirts of their hakamas and
walk barefoot, as did also the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> and all the
<persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName>, lifting high their loose silk costumes.
And so they set out once more and made for the port of
<placeName>Hakozaki</placeName>, while the rain fell in torrents and the gusts of wind
blew the sand in all directions, and the rain-drops mingled with
and simulated their tears. Praying to the deities of the shrines
of <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName>, <placeName>Hakozaki</placeName>, <placeName>Kashii</placeName> and <placeName>Munakata</placeName>, they made
supplication that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> might again return to his own
Capital. After enduring the steep and dangerous climb over
the cliffs and rough rocks of <placeName>Tarumiyama</placeName> and <placeName>Uzurahama</placeName>, they
emerged on to the wide sandy plain, and the blood that flowed
from their feet, so unaccustomed to any toil, dyed the sand,
deepening the colour of the scarlet hakamas of some, while it
reddened to a scarlet hue the white skirts of others. Even
the trials of <persName>Genzo</persName>, when he travelled over lofty mountains and
shifting sands from <placeName>China</placeName> to <placeName>India</placeName> to seek the Holy Pitakas,
were not more severe, but as he was in quest of the Sacred
<title>Sutras</title> he endured them for his own benefit and that of
mankind; this was but the way to the trials of battle that
they trod, the melancholy road to the other world.

<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><persName>Genzo</persName>. Chin. <persName>Hiuen Tsiang</persName>.</note>
<p>
Now <persName>Harada-no-taiyu Tanenao</persName> had accompanied them
from <placeName>Miyako</placeName> with a force of two thousand men, but when
<persName>Hyōtōji Hidetō</persName> came forth from his hold of <placeName>Yamaga</placeName> to meet
them with a large force, since there was bitter enmity between
<pb n="85" xml:id="p99-85"/>

the two, <persName>Tanenao</persName> left them and turned back again. As they
were proceeding on their way they passed through a
village that went by the name of <placeName>Ashiya</placeName>, and as this was
the name of a place between <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>
that they all knew well, it pleased them more than
other places, though it made them the more homesick.
So, though they had declared themselves ready to go to
<placeName>Shinra</placeName>, <placeName>Keitan</placeName>, <placeName>Kōrai</placeName>, and other distant regions beyond the
sea, yet meeting this wild wea her they were glad to take
refuge in <placeName>Yamaga</placeName>, the stronghold of <persName>Hyotoji Hideto</persName>. Hearing
again, however, that the enemy was advancing on them there.
also, they fled once more, and, embarking in small boats,
voyaged all night till they came to the port of <placeName>Yanagi-ga-ura</placeName> in
<placeName>Buzen</placeName>. Here again they meditated on fixing their new capital,
and a Council of Courtiers was held about it, but as their means
would not permit of building a Palace, and also because they
heard tidings that the <orgName>Genji</orgName> were threatening them from
<placeName>Nagato</placeName>, they again put to sea in fishing boats to be tossed
hither and thither on the ocean. Now the third son of
<persName>Shigemori</persName>, <persName>Sa-Chūjō Kiyotsune</persName>, was of a meditative nature and
much given to deep thought; and as he stood by the gunwale
of the ship one moonlight night of the tenth month, playing the
flute and reciting verses, he reflected how the Capital was in the
hands of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, and now they had fled to <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> they had
been driven away by <persName>Koreyoshi</persName>, so that they were like
fish caught in a net. If they were thus to be shunned
wherever they went, of what profit to live any longer?
So, calmly he chanted the solemn words of the <title>Sutras</title> and
repeated the <term>Nembutsu</term>, after which he dropped from the
ship and sank in the waves. Deep though unavailing
was the lamentation among the <persName>Courtiers</persName>, both men and
women alike.
</p>
<p>
As <placeName>Nagato</placeName> was the fief of <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori</persName>, the
Mokudai <persName>Kii-no-Gyöbu-no-taiyu Michisuke</persName>, hearing that the
<persName>Heike</persName> had nothing but small fishing boats, presented them with
<pb n="86" xml:id="p100-86"/>

a hundred large vessels in which they re-embarked and sailed to-
<placeName>Shikoku</placeName>. There by the invitation of <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Taiyū
Shigeyoshi</persName>, on the seashore of <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, they built in
rough timbers a representation of the Imperial Court and
Palace; but, as they shrank from permitting His Majesty to
inhabit such a common structure, it was decided that the real
Palace should be a ship. <persName>Munemori</persName> and the <persName>Courtiers</persName> had to
spend their days in the thatched huts of the fishermen, while
they passed the nights on shipboard. Thus the Imperial Vessel
floated like a dragon on the waves, a moving Palace that knew
no rest. Plunged in sorrow deep as the tide, their lives were
frail as the frosted grasses. At dawn the clamour of the
seabirds on the spits increased their anguish, and at night the
grating of the ships on the beach tormented them. When they
saw the flocks of herons in the distant pines, their hearts sank,
wondering if they were the white flags of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>; and when
the cry of the wildgeese were wafted from the offing, they
trembled lest it might be the oar-beats of the foe by night.
The keen breeze lashed their blackened eyebrows and painted
faces, and the salt spray penetrated their delicate eyes, which
home-sick longing filled so oft with tears.
For their
greencurtained chambers of scarlet they had exchanged the earthen
walls of the reed-hung cottage, and instead of the scented smoke
of ther braziers rose the briny fumes of the fisherman's
driftwood. The features of the Court Ladies, bereft of
cosmetics and swollen with continual weeping, were so altered
as hardly to be recognised.

<persName>Sa-shisho Nakahara Yasusada</persName> was appointed as Envoy to
<pb n="87" xml:id="p101-87"/>

convey it.
On the fourth day of the tenth month <persName>Yasusada</persName>
arrived at <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>. "Since it is in acknowledgement of my
reputation for military prowess that I receive this title,'
declared <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, "it is well that I receive it at the shrine of
the god of battles, <persName>Hachiman Dai-Bosatsu</persName>. Now the shrine of
<placeName>Hachiman</placeName> at <placeName>Tsuru-ga-oka</placeName> is, as to its site, exactly as that of
<placeName>Iwashimizu</placeName> in the Capital, and is built with long galleries and a
two-storied gate, while the paved avenue that leads up to its
lofty seat is more than ten chō in length. As to who should
receive the Imperial Edict, it was decided, after a consultation,
that the privilege should be given to <persName>Miura-no suke Yoshizumi</persName>.
He was of the stock of <persName>Miura-no-heita Tametsugu</persName>, famed as a
mighty warrior in all the <placeName>Kwantō</placeName>, and as his father <persName>Osuke</persName> had
fallen in battle for <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, this honour would shed lustre on
his spirit in the gloom of the <placeName>Yellow Springs of death</placeName>. With
<persName>Yasusada</persName> came two of his house and ten retainers, and <persName>Miura</persName>
took also the same number of followers. Those of <persName>Miura's</persName>
household were <persName>Hiki-no-Toshiro Yoshikazu</persName> and <persName>Wada no-
Saburo Munezane</persName>, while his retainers were all great lords, cach
fully equipped for the occasion. He himself was arrayed in a
hitatare of dark blue and armour laced with black silk. His
sword was mounted in black lacquer, and in his quiver were
twenty-four black and white feathered arrows; he carried his
<term>Shigeto</term> bow under his arm, and hung his helmet over his
shoulder and bowed low as he received the Imperial Ed ct.
To the formal enquiry of the Envoy: "Who is it who is
present to receive this Edict ? Let him declare his name and
titles"; <persName>Miura</persName>, seemingly abashed to proclaim his master's
name, gave his own: <persName>Miura-no-Arajirō Yoshizumi</persName>." He
then received the Edict in a casket and presented it to
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>, who returned it again after a short interval. <persName>Yasu-
sada</persName>, thinking it rather heavy, opened it, and found that it
contained gold dust to the value of a hundred ryō. <persName>Yasusada</persName>
was then entertained at a banquet in the <placeName>Haiden</placeName> of the shrine,
and waited upon by officials of high rank. He was also
<pb n="88" xml:id="p102-88"/>

presented with three horses, one of which, fully apparelled, was
led forward by <persName>Kudo Ichiro Suketsune</persName>. A special lodging,
built in ancient style, thatched with rushes, was provided for
him, with a clothes-chest containing two suits of bedding of
thick cotton and ten sets of lined garments. He received,
moreover, a thousand rolls of white linen with patterns of
indigo. The cups and dishes that he used were also of the
most rich and beautiful description.
</p>
<p>
The next day he paid a visit to <persName>Yoritomo</persName> in his own
mansion, which was guarded within and without by samurai.
Outside were ranged his own household retainers on bended
knee, while within, on the upper dais, sat all the <orgName>Genji</orgName> lords,
succeded by all the lords of the <placeName>Kwanto</placeName>, great and small, in
the lower seats. <persName>Yasusada</persName> was seated among the lords of the
<persName>Genji</persName>, and, after a while, was introduced into an inner chamber
laid with fine mats with borders of <placeName>Korai</placeName> brocade of black and
white, the adjoining verandah being also laid with similar mats
with an edging of purple. When the Envoy had taken his seat
there, a curtain was raised, disclosing <persName>Yoritomo</persName> himself. He
was attired in a plain Court robe and a high eboshi. His
stature was small, though his face was large; his features were
handsome and his speech clear and distinct. "The <persName>Heike</persName>,"
he began, "in fear of my might have fled from <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, and
now, strangely enough, <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> and <persName>Jūro Kurando
Yukie</persName> have forced their way into the city. receiving Court
Rank and choosing provinces for themselves in virtue of my
exploits. Moreover <persName>Hidehira</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName> has been appointed
Mutsu no-kami, and <persName>Satake-no-Kwanja</persName> has been made Hitachi-no-kami, by no means according to my will. I wish therefore
that an Imperial Edict be issued giving me authority to subdue
them". "For that I will go surety", replied the Envoy,
"and though now I am only carrying out the Imperial
Command, when I return to the Capital I will see that it is
done. My younger brother, <persName>Shi-no-Taiyu Shigeyoshi</persName> will also
assist me ". "In the position I now am", replied <persName>Yoritomo</persName>,
<pb n="89" xml:id="p103-89"/>

with a contemptuous smile, "sureties are hardly needed, but
I shall know if you do as you say ". <persName>Yasusada</persName> had
declared that he wished to start back again for the Capital on
that very day, but he was persuaded to remain until the
morrow. The next day he again repaired to the mansion of
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>. He was then presented with a body-armour laced
with green silk, a sword mounted in silver, a <term>Shigetō</term> bow of
red and black lacquer with a set of arrows, and thirteen horses,
three of them saddled. His twelve followers also received a
complete equipment each, comprising, hitatare, kosode, okuchi
hakama, horse and weapons. The number of the horses that
he received amounted in all to three hundred. Moreover from
the time that they left <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> until they reached the
boundary of <placeName>Omi</placeName>, at each stopping-place they were provided
with ten <term>koku</term> of rice, an amount that was not only more than
sufficient for their Own use, but enabled them to give
generously in charity.

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>CONCERNING NEKOMA.</head>
<p>As soon as <persName>Yasusada</persName> returned to the Capital he presented
himself at the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, and, sitting down humbly in
the courtyard, reported all that had taken place in the East
The <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was struck with admiration at all he heard, and
the faces of all the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> were wreathed in
smiles, for th's gallant behaviour of <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was very different
from that of <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> who was now protector of the
Capital. He was of fair complexion and handsome appearance,
it is true, but his manners and way of speaking were rough
and unpolished in the extreme. For this indeed there was
good reason; for how could anyone be other who had been
brought up from the age of two until over thirty in the wild
mountain country of <placeName>Kiso</placeName>? The following incident may show
his rudeness! There was a certain Courtier called <persName>Nekoma-no-Chūnagon Mitsutaka-no-Kyō</persName>, 
<pb n="90" xml:id="p104-90"/>

who had something to say to
<persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, so he sought him at his mansion. On his entering,
a retainer announced: "<persName>Nekoma-dono</persName> has deigned to arrive."
On hearing this <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> burst into a loud laugh; "Do
cats (<foreign xml:lang="ja">neko</foreign>) call on people here?" asked. "It is a Courtier
named <persName>Nekoma-no-Chūnagon-dono</persName>, Your Excellency,” replied
the retainer "Oh, then admit him," returned <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, and
after a while, not using his proper name <persName>Nekoma</persName>, he called out
in his rough dialect: "It is now the feeding time for <persName>Neko-
dono</persName>, bring in the meal!" And although the <persName>Chūnagon</persName>
politely declined, <persName>Kiso</persName> pressed him, saying: "Oh, but I have
some 'unsalted' mushrooms; come along"; thinking, in his
ignorance that the epithet 'unsalted' meant 'fresh' when used
of anything, though it can only be properly applied to fish.
<persName>Nenoi-no-Koyata</persName> served them at the meal, and large deep
bowls piled high with food, such as are used in the country,
were set before them; and beside the three side dishes eaten
with the rice there were mushrooms boiled in broth. <persName>Kiso</persName>
seized his chop-sticks and began to eat heartily, but the
. <persName>Chūnagon</persName>, whose palate revolted at this coarse rustic food,
could not eat anything. "Perhaps you think my bowls are
not clean," said⚫ <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, “but these are the ones I use
for ceremonially pure meals, so pray don't be afraid to eat."
Being thus pressed, and fearing it would give offence if he
touched nothing, the <persName>Chunagon</persName> took up his chop-sticks and
pretended to eat, merely toying with the food. <persName>Kiso</persName>, noticing
this, laughed boisterously. <persName>Neko-dono</persName> has a very small
appetite; don't stand on ceremony, have a good 'cat's surfeit.'
The <persName>Chūnagon</persName>, however, was quite upset by this treatment and
left again without even saying what he had intended.
</p>
<p>
On another occasion, when <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> went to the Palace
of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, thinking it not necessary to wear the official
hitatare of a Courtier of high rank, he hurriedly put on a <term>ho-¡</term>
and went in that, and the set of his headdress, the way he
managed his long sleeves and the hang of his hakama were so
<pb n="91" xml:id="p105-91"/>

awkward and clumsy that his whole appearance was boorish
and ridiculous in the extreme. How extraordinary was the
contrast to his imposing figure when on his horse and clad in
complete armour with his bow and arrows at his back. But
this time he must needs ride in an ox-car, and he used one that
belonged to <persName>Munemori</persName>, with his ox-drivers and a very fine
yoke of oxen. The oxen had not been driven for a long time,
and so were exceedingly spirited, and as soon as they got out
of the gate the ox-drivers whipped them up so that they
started off at a gallop. The sudden jerk threw <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>
off his balance and he fell on his back inside the car, and
as he lay there with his wide sleeves spread out on each
side of him, he looked like some huge butterfly. He struggled
to get up again, but somehow he could not manage it, and
though he shouted to the drivers to stop the car, they
misunderstood his rustic dialect, and thinking he was telling them to
hurry on, kept the animals at a gallop for five or six cho.
Then <persName>Imai-no-Shirō</persName> spurred on his horse and overtook them,
shouting out: "What do you mean by driving on in that
way?"
"The noses of the honourable oxen are too strong to
stop them," replied the ox-drivers, and then, wishing to help
<persName>Kiso</persName> to right himself, they told him to hold on to the hand-rafl
with which the car was furnished. "Ah, that's a good idea,"
exclaimed <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> as he did so, "I wonder whether the
drivers thought of it, or whether that is the way their master
used to do." In this way he reached the gate of the Palace,
and when he came to alight he made to do so from the back of
the car, as he had got in. Seeing this the servants corrected
him, saying: "When your Excellency gets into on ox-car it is
proper to get in at the back, but when alighting, it is proper to
do so from the front." "It is niy car," replied <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, "so
I shall do as I please; and he got out at the back.
</p>
<p>
Many other ridiculous things <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> did also, but I
hesitate to speak of them. The ox-drivers were afterwards
put to death.

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT MIZUSHIMA.</head>
<p>Meanwhile the <orgName>Heike</orgName> abode at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, and
from that place fought with and subdued the eight provinces of
the <placeName>Sanyōdō</placeName> and the six of the <placeName>Nankaidō</placeName> districts, fourteen in
all. <persName>Kiso</persName> therefore, feeling uneasy, despatched a force of seven
thousand men to the <placeName>Sanyodo</placeName> under the command of <persName>Yada-no-Hangwan-dai Yoshikiyo</persName>, the son of <persName>Mutsu-no-Shin-Hangwan
Yoshiyasu</persName>; <persName>Umeno-no-Yaheijirō Yukihiro</persName> of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> being the
leader of the samurai. It was the first day of the tenth month
when they arrived at <placeName>Mizushima</placeName> in <placeName>Bitchū</placeName> and set about
launching their ships to cross over to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, and as they
were thus engaged a small boat came in sight, rowing across
from the other side. At first they thought it was only a fishing
boat, but as they looked they saw that it was one of the enemy
ships coming to spy out their position, or perhaps to negotiate.
Immediately the <orgName>Genji</orgName> rushed their five hundred ships into the
water with great haste and sailed to the attack. The <persName>Heike</persName>
were then coming on to meet them with a fleet of a thousand
vessels. Their commander was <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName>, with <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> as captain under him. The
<persName>Heike</persName> ships were made fast alongside each other by hawsers
from the stem and stern, and between these hawsers other ropes
were fastened, on which planks were stretched for walking,
so that the whole fleet became like a level surface for the
fighting men.
</p>
<p>
As they were about to begin the onset, <persName>Noto-no-
kami Noritsune</persName> cried out in a mighty voice: "Ho! men of
<placeName>Shikoku</placeName>! how can you bear the shame of being taken alive
by these boors of the North? Upon them and grapple!"
And so, shouting their warcry, they began the fight, drawing
their bows and pouring in a hail of arrows until they came to
close quarters, when they drew their swords and engaged each
other hand to hand. Some also plied long iron rakes with
which they pulled their opponents into the water, and some,
<pb n="93" xml:id="p107-93"/>

locked in the death-gripe, stabbed each other and fell into the
waves. Thus the battle went on and there was no gap made in
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> ships, but after a while <persName>Umeno-no-Yahei Yukihiro</persName>,
who led the <orgName>Genji</orgName> samurai, was smitten to death. Then <persName>Yada-no-Hangwan Yoshikiyo</persName>, desperate at his fate, sprang into a
small boat with six of his retainers and led a fierce attack in the
very forefront of the battle, but all in vain, for his boat was
capsized by the enemy and all in it were drowned. Now the
<persName>Heike</persName> had brought their horses with them in the ships, and as
they approached the shore they pushed them off into the water
to swim to the beach. Since they were ready accoutred, as soon
as they found a foothold the riders clambered into their saddles
and rode them with a mighty splashing through the shallows to
the shore, and five hundred horsemen, led by <persName>Noto-no-kami
Noritsune</persName>, precipitated themselves on the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, who,
discomfited by the death of both their leaders, fled headlong in confused
panic. Thus by this victory of <placeName>Mizushima</placeName> the <orgName>Heike</orgName> wiped
away the shame of their former defeat.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9" xml:id="v8_ch9">
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>THE DEATH OF SENO.</head>
<p>When <persName>Kiso</persName> heard of this defeat he was filled with anxiety
and at once rode off to the province of <placeName>Bitchū</placeName> with ten thousand
horsemen. Now <persName>Seno-no-Tarō Kaneyasu</persName> of <placeName>Bitchū</placeName>, a partizan
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and a famous warrior, had by ill luck been taken
prisoner by <persName>Kuramitsu-no-Jirō Narizumi</persName> of <placeName>Kaga</placeName> in the fighting
of the fifth month in the North Country, and would have been
put to death but for the intervention of <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, who told
him that it was a pity to slay such a brave fellow. <persName>Narizumi</persName>
accordingly put him in charge of his younger brother <persName>Saburō
Nariuji</persName>, and as <persName>Seno</persName> was a man of fine character and easy
manners he was very well treated. Still, as we read that even
the men of old fretted their hearts when in exile in a far
country, so his grief was not unlike that of <persName>So-shi-kei</persName> when he
<pb n="94" xml:id="p108-94"/>

was imprisoned in the land of <placeName>Ko</placeName>, or of <persName>Ri-sho-kei</persName> when he
was unable to return to the Court of <placeName>Kan</placeName>. Even as these
Chinese warriors passed their days among the barbarians,
"satisfying their hunger and thirst with sour milk and raw flesh",
so <persName>Kaneyasu</persName>, abstaining even from sleep, spent his nights and
days in continual planning how he might take his enemies by
surprise and slay them and return to his former lord. At last
he said to <persName>Kuramitsu-no-Saburō</persName>: "Since you have spared my
worthless life and treated me thus, for whom beside should I
have any thought? In the next battle it is on the side of <persName>Kiso</persName>
that I will risk my life. Moreover, on my estate at <placeName>Seno</placeName> in
<placeName>Bitchu</placeName> there grows fine fodder for horses in great abundance,
and if you wish I can guide you there to take it." On this
being told to <persName>Kiso</persName> he exclaimed: “Ah, I am sorry for that
fellow; but go down and get the fodder at once." So <persName>Kura-
mitsu-no-Saburo</persName> taking thirty men with him went down to
<placeName>Bitchū</placeName> accompanied by <persName>Seno</persName>. But <persName>Seno's</persName> eldest son <persName>Kotarō
Muneyasu</persName>, also a supporter of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, hearing that his
father had been set free by <persName>Kiso</persName>, gathered about a hundred
horsemen from among his younger retainers and set out to
welcome him, meeting the party at <placeName>Kōfu</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Harima</placeName>. From thence the two bands went on together until
they came to <placeName>Mitsuishi</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName> where they stopped for the
night, and as the friends of <persName>Seno</persName> had brought a quantity of
sake with them, they all sat down to a drinking bout in which
the thirty retainers of <persName>Kuramitsu</persName> soon became heavily in
toxicated, so that they could by no means stand upright,
whereupon <persName>Seno's</persName> men fell upon them and put them all to
death. After this they set off to <placeName>Kōfu</placeName>, the residence of the
Deputy Governor of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, who had been appointed by <persName>Jūrō
Kurando Yukiie</persName>, to whom <placeName>Bizen</placeName> had been given in fief, and
attacked and slew him. Then said <persName>Senō</persName>: "I have obtained
my freedom from <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> and come back home again;
now le: all who are on the side of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> prepare to give
battle to <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> when he comes down here against us.” So
<pb n="95" xml:id="p109-95"/>

all the men-at-arms of the Provinces of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, <placeName>Bitchū</placeName> and <placeName>Bingo</placeName>
armed themselves and came with their horses and men to the
support of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and even the old men who had retired
from active life put on again their faded yellow hitatare and
shortened their linen kosode, girding on their worn out and
damaged body armour and providing themselves with
homemade quivers of bamboo that held but few arrows. So there
gathered to <persName>Senō's</persName> mansion a force of some two thousand men,
and these made a fort amid the bamboo thickets and narrow
field-paths at <placeName>Fukuryūji</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, digging a moat twenty feet
wide and the same number of feet deep, fortifying it with
barricades and defences of felled trees and building a high
tower within.
</p>
<p>
Now when the Deputy Governor of <placeName>Bizen</placeName> was slain, his
men fled toward the Capital, but at <placeName>Funasakayama</placeName> on the
boundary of <placeName>Bizen</placeName> and <placeName>Harima</placeName> they met <persName>Kiso</persName> and his army
and told him what had occurred. "Ah", exclaimed <persName>Yoshi-
naka</persName> in great wrath, "it was after all a pity that I did not put
him to death.' "Indeed", replied <persName>Imai Shirō Kanehira</persName>, "you
can see by his face he is no ordinary man, how many times did
I not urge you to put such a daring and formidable foe out of
the way; at any rate let me go after him and see what he is
about to do now"? So <persName>Imai</persName> galloped off to <placeName>Bizen</placeName> with three
thousand men. Now the path that led to <persName>Seno's</persName> stronghold at
<placeName>Fukuryūji</placeName> was only about seven feet wide, while its length was
one ri as computed in the Western Provinces. On each side of
it were deep rice-fields where horses could get no foothold, so
that, although <persName>Imai's</persName> force pressed on hotly, their pace was
hindered by the crowding of their mounts.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Senō-no-Tarō</persName>, seeing <persName>Imai</persName> himself push forward at their
head, hasted to the top of the tower and cried out in a loud
voice: "Pray receive this as some slight return for your care
of me while I was with you!" and he emptied his whole quiver
of twenty four arrows at them. Paying no heed to this.
however, <persName>Imai-no-Shirō</persName>, <persName>Miyazaki Saburō</persName>, <persName>Umeno</persName>, <persName>Mochizuki</persName>,
<pb n="96" xml:id="p110-96"/>

<persName>Suwa</persName>, <persName>Fujisawa</persName> and other valiant warriors, each worth a
thousand ordinary men, spurred forward to the onset and held
grimly on though many fell pierced by arrows, both men and
horses. One taking the place of another who fell, they bent
low over their horses heads, shielding themselves with the
neck-pieces of their helmets, and plunging recklessly througl
the ricefields till they sank to the bellies of their steeds, heaving
them up by the breast-strap of their harness, and caring
nothing for the deepest morasses. So they pressed on,
shouting their war-cry and fearing nothing, till of the followers of
<persName>Senō</persName>, few in number as they were and unsupported, very many
received mortal wounds.
</p>
<p>
When night came, as the fortress on which he relied had
been broken through, <persName>Senō</persName>, unable to make further resistance,
retired to the river <placeName>Itakura</placeName> in the extremity of <placeName>Bitchū</placeName> and
threw up a barricade to await the enemy. <persName>Imai</persName> soon followed
and renewed the attack, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> retainers fought as long
as their supply of arrows lasted, but when these had been all
used and they could hold off their foes no longer, they scattered
and fled in all directions. <persName>Senō</persName> himself, with the only two of
his retainers who were left, retired to the hills that skirted the
<placeName>Itakuragawa</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Kuramitsu-no-jirō Narizumi</persName>, who had captured <persName>Seno</persName>
on the former occasion, bitter at the thought of his younger
brother who had been killed, and wishing to avenge him,
press d hard on his heels to take him again. Coming up alone
to within one cho of his en.my, for he had outdistanced all the
others, he called out in a loud voice: 'Ho there! <persName>Senō</persName>!
Turn back! it is not for a samurai to show his back to a foe."
<persName>Senō</persName> was just at this moment crossing the river, but when he
heard this he drew back again and faced his enemy.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Kuramitsu</persName> in great joy spurred his horse and charged
upon him, grappling him with such force that they both rolled
over; and as they where both men of great strength, neither
would give way, but they rolled over and over, first. one on
<pb n="97" xml:id="p111-97"/>

top and then the other, until, coming nearer in their struggles
to the brink of the river, they rolled over the edge and fell in,
<persName>Kuramitsu</persName> was not able to swim while <persName>Senō</persName> was exceedingly
expert, so, pressing his foe against the bottom, he drew the
dagger from his side, and pulling up the skirts of his armour,
stabbed him so deeply with it three times that the hilt and his
hand sank in also. This done, as his own horse was
overridden, he mounted that of <persName>Kuramitsu</persName> and rode off to the west
with his enemy's head.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Senō's</persName> eldest son <persName>Kotaro Muneyasu</persName> was only twenty years
old, but as he was very fat he had only managed to get to the
distance of one cho, while his father had ridden on more than
twenty. His father noticing this said to one of his retainers:
"Many times before have. I faced a host of foes and fought
with a light heart, but to-day, as I have left my son behind, my
mind is oppressed with gloom. Even if I escape alive and once
more join my friends, I am over sixty years old and know not
how much longer I have to live, and what will my companions
say of a samurai who leaves his only son behind to save his
life?" "Then," said the retainer, "it were best to return;
I will go back also and see what has befallen your son."
So they rode back and found <persName>Muneyasu</persName> fallen by theroadside,
for his feet were so swollen that he could go no further.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Senō</persName> alighted from his horse and said to his son:
"See, I have come back again to stay by you whatever may
happen." "As I can do no more," answered <persName>Kotaro</persName>, weeping
bitterly, "I shall now put an end to my life, for it would be
as one of the Five Iniquities if you were to risk your life on my
account: I pray you hurry on." To this request his father
would not listen, and moreover, just at that moment about fifty,
fresh soldiers of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> came riding up to where he was
resting. Then <persName>Senō-on-Tarō</persName> drew from his quiver the eight
arrows that he had left, and fitting them to his bow, brought
down eight men fromtheir saddles, though whether they lived

the head of his son first, after which he dashed into the midst
of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and fought desperately, swinging his blade
downwards, sideways, crosswise and in a circle, until at last
he fell, overcome by weight of numbers. His two retainers
also fought around him with equal courage till they were badly
wounded and taken prisoner, dying eventually the day after.
The heads of all three were then taken and exposed at <placeName>Sagi-
ga-mori</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>. "He was a valiant warrior
indeed," said <persName>Kiso</persName>, when they told him; "how I wish he
were still alive."

<head>THE FIGHT AT MUROYAMA.</head>
<p>Meanwhile <persName>Kiso</persName> was collecting his forces at <placeName>Manju-on-Shō</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Bitchū</placeName>, with the intent of moving agoinst
<placeName>Yashima</placeName>, when <persName>Higuchi-on Jirō-Kanemitsu</persName>, whom he had left
behind to represent him in the Capital, sent him a letter stating
that, while his master was away, <persName>Juro Kurando</persName> had obtained
great influence with the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and was telling many
slanderous tales about him; so that it would be well that he
should leave the campaign in the west for a time and come
back immediately to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>. <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> immediately started
off for the Capital without a moment's delay, and <persName>Yukiie</persName>
wishing to avoid an open quarrel with his nephew, started off
by way of <placeName>Tamba</placeName> for the povince of <placeName>Harima</placeName> with fifty thousand
men.
<persName>Kiso</persName> travelled to the Capital through the province of
<placeName>Settsu</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Heike</persName>, on the other hand, now entered the province
of <placeName>Harima</placeName> with an army of twenty thousand to attack <persName>Kiso</persName>.
It was commanded by <persName>Shin-Chunagon. Tomomori</persName> and <persName>Hon-
sammi Chūjō Shigehira</persName>, and in command of the samurai
were <persName>Etchū-on-Jirōhyōye Moritsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorōhyōye
Tadamitsu</persName>, <persName>Akushichi-hyōye Kagekiyo</persName>, and <persName>Iga-no-Heinai-
zaemon Ienaga</persName>. <persName>Jūrō Kurando Yukiie</persName>, thinking to regain
<pb n="99" xml:id="p113-99"/>

favour with <persName>Kiso</persName> by attacking the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, advanced to
<placeName>Muroyama</placeName> where they were encamped with a force of five
hundred horsemen. Now the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had arranged their men
in five separate camps. <persName>Iga-no-Heinaizaemon Ienaga</persName> with two
thousand men occupied one; <persName>Etchu-on-Jirōhyōye Moritsugu</persName>
with two thousand another; <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorōhyōye Tadamitsu</persName>,
and <persName>Akushichi-hyōye Kagekiyo</persName> held the third with another
three thousand; <persName>Hon-sammi Chujo Shigehira</persName> with three
thousand held the fourth; while <persName>Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> with ten
thousand commanded the fifth. They had, moreover taken
counsel together and settled that each of these four smaller
forces, beginning with that of <persName>Ienaga</persName>, should engage the enemy
in turn and break through his centre, after which they would
move round his rear and flanks to surround him and smite him
on all sides at once; and so, in accordance with this plan, they
advanced vigorously on <persName>Yukiie's</persName> small army. <persName>Jurō Kurando</persName>,
finding himself thus outdone and surrounded, yet did not blench
or fly, but fought where he was to the last wi.hout taking
any account of his life. <persName>Kishichiemon</persName>, <persName>Kihachiemon</persName>, and
<persName>Akushichiemon</persName>, three of the most trusty and brave of
<persName>Tomomori's</persName> guards fell by his single hand; and then, when
his five hundred men had been reduced to but thirty, breaking
forth through the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, who rolled about them like clouds
of mist, himself unhurt, though most of his retainers were
wounded, they took ship from <placeName>Takasago</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName> and crossed
over to <placeName>Fukei</placeName> in <placeName>Izumi</placeName>, from whence they fled for refuge to
the stronghold of <placeName>Nagano</placeName> in <placeName>Kawachi</placeName>. As the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had
now triumphed in the two battles of <placeName>Muroyama</placeName> and <placeName>Mizushima</placeName>,
their forces grew continually gretater.

<head>TSUZUMI HANGWAN.</head>
<p>The soldiers of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> swarmed everywhere in the
Capital, and entered any place at their will to plunder. Not
</p>
<p><pb n="100" xml:id="p114-100"/>

excepting even the sacred precincts of <placeName>Kamo</placeName> and <placeName>Yahata</placeName>, they
reaped the crops for their use and broke into people's
storehouses to take what they wanted; they even waylaid the
citizens in the street and robbed them. In fact they were a
much worse plague than the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been before them, for,
as the people of the city said, the men of <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> did not
steal the clothes from off your back. Therefore the <persName>Ho-o</persName> sent
a message to <persName>Kiso Sama-no-kami</persName> to put an end to this violence,
and <persName>Iki-no-Hangwan Tomoyasu</persName> was appointed to bear it. As
he was an exceedingly good player on the drum (Tsuzumi) he
was commonly called <persName>Tsuzumi Hangwan</persName>. When <persName>Kiso</persName> met,
him, without giving any reply to the <persName>Ho o's</persName> communication, he
enquired: "Why is it that you are called <persName>Tsuzumi Hangwan</persName>?
Is it because you are accustomed to be beaten or drummed
on by everybody?" <persName>Tomoyasu</persName> immediately left in disgust
without giving any answer, and returning to the <persName>Ho ō's</persName> Palace,
declared: "<persName>Yoshinaka</persName> is a presumptuous fool and must be
put down at once. He is certainly disobedient to the Throne.".
To this the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> agreed, but those whom he entrusted with his
order to attack <persName>Kiso</persName> were not warriors of repute, but the chiefs
of <placeName>Miidera</placeName> and <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, who accordingly assembled their bands
of unruly monks, and the <roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName>, who could not
muster anyone better than a motley crowd of begging priests
and prowling streetloafers to their standard. On the other,
hand <persName>Murakami-no Saburō Hangwandai</persName> of the <persName>Shinano Genji</persName>
forsook the side of <persName>Kiso</persName> and adhered to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>. As soon as
the men of the five provinces of the Imperial Domains saw that
<persName>Kiso</persName> was out of favour with the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, they too abandoned the
allegiance they had previously proffered him and adhered to:
the side of the Throne. Then <persName>Imai-on-Shiro</persName> gave his advice
to <persName>Kiso</persName> as follows: "Seeing that matters have now assumed
a very serious aspect, how can you put yourself in opposition
to our Sacred and Blameless Emperor? There is nothing to
be done but humbly doff your helmet and lay aside your
weapons in submission." At this speech <persName>Kiso</persName> flew into a great
<pb n="101" xml:id="p115-101"/>

rage: Ever since I came forth from <placeName>Shinano</placeName>," he exclaimed,
"from my first battles at <placeName>Ōmi</placeName> and <placeName>Aida</placeName> I´have never once
turned my back to the foe: at <placeName>Tonami</placeName>, <placeName>Kurosaka</placeName> and
<placeName>Shinohara</placeName> in the North, and at the strongholds of <placeName>Fukuryuji</placeName> and
<placeName>Itakura</placeName> in the West everywhere I have conquered; why then
should I lay down my arms and surrender, even to an
Emperor of the Ten Virtues?'

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT THE HŌJŪJIDEN.</head>
<p>"If I have been appointed to protect the Capital", con.
tinued <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, my men must at least have a horse to ride,
so why should the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> object in this unreasonable way to
their getting a little fodder from the fields? If the young men
go into the country districts of the eastern and western hills
round the city and take some rice for their rations, what is the
harm in that? They don't go to the Palaces or the mansions of
the <persName>Courtiers</persName> for it. But I know the cause of it: it is that
<persName>Tsuzumi Hangwan</persName> who has been slandering me to his Majesty.
Go and beat that Tsuzumi until you break it! This
may be the last fight of <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, and without doubt it will
come to the ears of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>; so quit yourselves well, men!
</p>
<p>
Now the Northern forces had formerly numbered fifty
thousand horse, but so many had deserted that only some six
or seven thousand were left. ?
</p>
<p>
According to <persName>Yoshinaka's</persName> usual strategy these were
divided into seven companies, of which one of some two
thousand men was put under the command of <persName>Higuchi-no-Jirō
Kanemitsu</persName> to lead the attack from the direction of <placeName>Imakumano</placeName>,
while the rest were ordered to be ready, each in the avenue or
street where they were quartered, so as to be able to unite in
<placeName>Rokujō-kawara</placeName>. As a sign of recognition they all wore a
badge of pine-leaves.
</p>
<p><pb n="102" xml:id="p116-102"/>

It was the morning of the nineteenth day of the eleventh
month that the fight began. Hearing that twenty thousand
men were posted in the <persName>Hō-o's</persName> Palace of the <placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName>, <persName>Kiso</persName>
rode round by the western gate to see what was doing, and
there he perceived <persName>Tsuzumi Hangwan Tomoyasu</persName>, who appeared
to be in command there, standing on top of the west wall of the
Palace, wearing nothing else but a hitatare of red brocade and
a helmet on his head, on which were written the names of the
<persName>Four Deva Kings</persName>. In one hand he carried a short halberd and
in the other a kind of sistrum such as is used by Yamabushi,
and this he kept on shaking, posturing and capering as he did
So. This caused much amusement among the <roleName>Nobles</roleName> and
<persName>Courtiers</persName>, who thought his behaviour not quite dignified, and
remarked: "<persName>Tomoyasu</persName> seems possessed by a <term>Tengu</term>." When
he perceived <persName>Kiso</persName>, he called out in a loud voice: "In the
good times of old, when the Imperial Edict was read, even the
withered plants and trees immediately burst into flower and
bore fruit, while the birds of the air fell from the sky and all
evil spirits and demons trembled and obeyed; and even in this
present worthless time he who dares to draw bow and shoot an
arrow against His Sacred Majesty shall find his arrow fly back
against his own body, and the sword that he draws turn back
on himself." "Such talk needs no reply ", said <persName>Kiso</persName>
laconically as he shouted his warcry for the onset.
</p>
<p>
At the same time <persName>Higuchi-no-Jiro</persName> and his two thousand
men rushed to the attack with loud shouts from the direction
of <placeName>Imakumano</placeName>, and <persName>Imai</persName> himself, putting fire into the head of a
turnip-headed arrow, shot it so that it stuck in the roof of the
<placeName>Hōjujiden Palace</placeName>, and as the wind was blowing strongly, the
flames immediately shot up high into the air and the sky was
filled with sparks. When he saw the Palace suddenly enveloped
in black smoke, the commander <persName>Tomoyasu</persName> was the first to
take to his heels, and when his army of twenty thousand men
perceived the flight of their leader, panic seized them and they
turned and fled with one accord. Such indeed was their haste
<pb n="103" xml:id="p117-103"/>

that some took their bows without any arrows, and some their
arrows without any bow; while others, dropping their halberds
upside down in their flurry pierced their own legs with the sharp
blades; some too there were who, catching the tips of their
bows in some obstacle, left them as they were that they might
flee the faster. When they came to the end of <placeName>Shichijō</placeName> in their
flight, however, another misfortune awaited them, for this
quarter was strongly guarded by another band of <persName>Settsu Genji</persName>
who had joined the <persName>Hō-ō's</persName> party, and who had been ordered to
fall upon any of <persName>Kiso's</persName> men who might flee from the <placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName>,
so that they had taken up positions on the house-tops and put
up their shields the e, providing themselves with heavy stones
and missiles to throw down on the heads of the enemy. When
therefore their own men came along in headlong flight, they
immediately began to hurl their stones at them, whereupon the
fugitives cried out that it was a mistake, for they were of the
party of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>. "That cry won't do "; replied the other
<persName>Genji</persName> ". we have the Imperial Order; "kill them! kill them!"
and they continued to pelt them with their missiles until many
were killed, and others, with their heads or backs crushed, fell
from their horses and managed to crawl away to some place of
refuge.
</p>
<p>
The end of <placeName>Hachijō</placeName> was held by the warrior monks of
<placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, but when the bolder among them were killed, the
more cowardly who were left also took to flight. Here
<persName>Mondo-no-kami Chikanari</persName>, attired in a light blue kariginu worn
over a body-armour laced with green silk and mounted on a
moon-white steed, was ascending the river bank to make his
escape, whom when <persName>Imai-no-Shirō Kanehira</persName> perceived he drew
his bow with great strength and let fly an arrow at him.
Whirring it flew straight at his skull, piercing it through so
that he fell backwards from his horse. He was the son of
<persName>Seidai-geki Yorinari</persName>, and was a learned doctor of the Academy:
it was first time that he had ever put on armour.
<persName>Omi-no-Chujo Tamekiyo</persName>, <persName>Echizen-no-Shōshō Nobuyuki</persName>, <persName>Hōki-no-kami
<pb n="104" xml:id="p118-104"/>

Mitsutsuna</persName> and his son <persName>Hōki-no-Hangwan Mitsutsune</persName> were also
- shot through and their heads taken. <persName>Murakami-no-Saburō
-
Hangwan-dai</persName> of <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, who had deserted <persName>Kiso's</persName> camp and
gone over to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, was killed also, and the grandson of
<persName>Azechi-no-Dainagon Sukekata-no-Kyō</persName>, <persName>U-Shōshō Masakata</persName>,
who went forth to the battle in armour and a high eboshi, was
taken alive by <persName>Higuchi-no-Jirō Kanemitsu</persName>. Both the <persName>Tendai
Zasshu Mei-un Dai-Sōjō</persName>, and <persName>Enkei-no-Shinnō</persName> the Abbot of
<placeName>Miidera</placeName> had gone to the <placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName>, but when it began to go
up in smoke they mounted their horses and hastened away,
only to fall victims to the fury of <persName>Kiso's</persName> samurai, who shot
them down from their horses and cut off their venerable heads.
The <persName>Hō-ō</persName> himself, at this disaster, entered his Car to make
an Imperial Progress to some safer Palace, but the northern
samurai, not knowing who he was, con inued to shoot their
arrows at it. Then <persName>Bungo no-Shōshō Munenaga</persName>, who, clad in
a yellowish-red hitatare with a high eboshi on his head, was
accompanying the Imperial Car, cried out to them:
"Make
no mistake! It is His Majesty!" whereon all the samurai
sprang from their horses and did obeisance. On His Majesty's
enquiring who they were, one of them stood forth and gave his
name and title as <persName>Yashima-no-Shirō Yukishige</persName> of the province of
<placeName>Shinano</placeName>, after which they escorted the Imperial Car to the
Palace in <placeName>Gojō</placeName>, keeping strict guard over it.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Gyōbu-kyō Sammi Yorisuke-no-Kyō</persName>, the before-mentioned
Governor of <placeName>Bungo</placeName>, had also been in the <placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName>, and when
it took fire he escaped and fled toward the river, but on the
way he was stripped of all his rich garments by some of the
lesser samurai, so that he had to go on stark named, and as it
was the morning of the nineteenth day of the eleventh month
the cold wind from the river cut him to the bone. His elder
brother <persName>Echizen-no-Hōkyō Shō-i</persName>, who had gone out to see the
battle, noticing his brother in this plight, and feeling sorry for
him, straightway ran to his assistance. As he was wearing two
white 'kosode' under his koromo or priestly garment, he took
<pb n="105" xml:id="p119-105"/>

off one of them and gave it to his brother, after which he
parted with his koromo also, so that he was left with one
kosode only. His appearance in this guise, without any sash,
seen from behind was truly ridiculous, and as the two hurried
along the streets, accompanied by some lower priests in white
robes, enquiring at his house and that where they could find a
lodging, the passers-by clapped their hands in glee and laughed
inordinately. The baby <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was put in a boat and
launched on the waters of the lake in the grounds of the
<placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName>, and as the opposing samurai shot arrows at this
also, <persName>Shichijo-no-jiju Nobukiyo</persName> and <persName>Kii-no-kami Norimitsu</persName>,
who were with His Majesty, called out to them to stop lest the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> be harmed. On learning who it was they dismounted
and did obeisance. Soon after His Majesty was accompanied
to the <placeName>Kanin Palace</placeName> in <placeName>Nijo</placeName>, but, sad to relate, the Imperial
Procession was of a pitiably attenuated kind.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Gen-no-Kurando Nakakane</persName> was holding the western
gate of the <placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName> with fifty horsemen, when <persName>Yamamoto-no-Kwanja Yoshitaka</persName> of the <persName>Omi Genji</persName> spurred up to him and
shouted: "Who is it you are guarding here? The <persName>Hō-ō</persName>
and the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> have both proceeded elsewhere." On hearing
this <persName>Nakakane</persName> rode off and precipitated himself into the battle
and fought hard until his force was reduced to eight in all.
Among these was a certain warrior-priest of the party of
<persName>Kūsaka</persName> named <persName>Kaga-bō</persName>, who was riding a cream-coloured
horse with a very hard mouth. "My horse's mouth is so
hard that I can hardly manage him"; he cried, whereon
<persName>Nakakane</persName> replied: "Take mine and give him to me instead";
and mounted him on his own horse, a chestnut with a white tail.
Then they charged at full speed into a party of two hundred
hostile samurai who were waiting at <placeName>Kawarasaka</placeName> under the
command of <persName>Nenoi-no-Koyata</persName>. and fought until but five
of the eight were left alive. <persName>Kaga-bō</persName>, although he was
mounted on his master's horse, met his fate here and fell
fighting at last.
</p>
<p><pb n="106" xml:id="p120-106"/>

Now one of the retainers of <persName>Nakakane</persName> named <persName>Jirō Kurando
Nakayori</persName>, seeing the chestnut horse with the white tail
galloping wildly along riderless, asked his servant whether that was
not the horse of his master, and on his answering that it was,
he further enquired from what direction it had come. "As
our master rode into the enemy at <placeName>Kawarasaka</placeName>," replied the
man, it is from that fight that his horse has come." Then
<persName>Jirō Kurando</persName>, bursting into tears, exclaimed; "Ah! how
wretched that he has fallen thus; ever since we played together
as children we have pledged ourselves to die together, and now,
unhappy, we must die separate." Taking farewell of his wife
and children he rode off alone and dashed into the fight at
<placeName>Kawarasaka</placeName>. Rising high in his stirrups, he shouted loudly:
"I am <persName>Jirō Kurando Nakayori</persName> of <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, twenty seven years
old, the second son of <persName>Shinano-no-kami Nakashige</persName>, and a
descendant in the ninth generation of <persName>Atuzane Shinno</persName>; come!
anyone who thinks himself somebody and let us see!" And he
swung his sword about him, cutting and slashing in all directions
until at last he fell, borne down by the weight of numbers.
His master <persName>Gen-no-Kurando</persName>, quite unaware of all this, had
escaped and ridden off toward the south with his brother
<persName>Kawachi-no-kami Nakanobu</persName> and another retainer. And it
chanced that, as the <persName>Sessho Motomichi</persName>, taking fright at the war
in the Capital, was on his way to take refuge at <placeName>Uji</placeName>, the two
overtook him at <placeName>Kobatayama</placeName>. Dismounting from their horses
they saluted him, and on his enquiring who they might be,
they declared themselves as <persName>Nakanobu</persName> and <persName>Nakamichi</persName>. The
<persName>Sessho</persName> was greatly rejoiced to hear this, for he had feared that
they might be some of the <persName>Kiso</persName> samurai, and requested them
to accompany him, which they did, and escorted him as far as
the <placeName>Fuke</placeName> mansion at <placeName>Uji</placeName>. Thence they parted and the two fled
to the province of <placeName>Kawachi</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
On the next day, the twentieth, <persName>Kiso Sama-no-kami
Yoshinaka</persName> proceeded to the <placeName>Rokujō-kawara</placeName> to count and
identify the heads of those who had been killed the day before,
<pb n="107" xml:id="p121-107"/>

and which were there exposed to view, and behold, their
number was six hundred and thirty; and among them were the
heads of the <persName>Tendai Zasshu Meiun Dai-Sōjō</persName> and <persName>Enkei-hō
Shinno</persName> the Abbot of <placeName>Miidera</placeName>; and of those who looked on
these there were none who did not shed tears. Then <persName>Kiso
Sama-no-kami</persName>, ordering his seven thousand men to turn
their horse's heads toward the east, bade them shout their
war-cry three times, whereat the heaven echoed and the earth
trembled. At this there was a great uproar in the city, but it
was only a shout of joy.
</p>
<p>
Now the <persName>Saishō Naganori</persName>, son of the late <persName>Shōnagon
Nyūdō Shinsai</persName>, went to visit the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> at the <placeName>Gojō Palace</placeName>,
but was refused admission by the soldiers on guard at the
gate. Stepping aside into a small house near by that he
knew, he cut off his hair and put on a black koromo and
hakama, after which he demanded admission again,
pleading that in such a habit there could be on objection, upon
which the samurai gåve way, and admitted him. Weeping
bitterly he entered the Imperial presence, and when he told the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> of all those who had been done to death in the fighting,
His Majesty burst into tears also, saying: "Ah that <persName>Mei-un</persName>
should have been thus innocently put to death; it seems as
though he had sacrificed his life for mine."
</p>
<p>
On the twenty third day <persName>Sanjō-no-Chūnagon Tomokata-no-Kyō</persName> and forty nine other <persName>Courtiers</persName> beneath him were
removed from their offices and put in prison. Under the rule
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> forty three had been dismissed at once, but this
present treatment was worse than their's for the number was
greater. Having also taken the daughter of the <persName>Kwampaku
Motofusa</persName> and made her his wife, he assembled his retainers
and gave his opinion thus: "I, <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, have confronted the
Sovereign Lord of this Empire in battle and have conquered.
If I would, I might become <roleName>Emperor</roleName> or I might become
<persName>Hō-ō</persName>: but I don't want to become <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, for I must become
a shaven priest; and how can I become <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, for I should,
<pb n="108" xml:id="p122-108"/>

have to be a child. Very well then, I will become <persName>Kwam-
paku</persName>." At this his official scribe, <persName>Taiyū-bō Kakumei</persName>, stood
up and said: "A <persName>Kwampaku</persName> must be of the princely house of
<persName>Fujiwara</persName>, of the stock and lineage of the great <persName>Kamatari</persName>; Your
Excellency is of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> line, and therefore cannot hold such
office." So it ended by <persName>Kiso</persName> consoling himself with the title of
Groom of the Stables to the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, and appropriat
ing the province of <placeName>Tanba</placeName> as his fief. That a <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>
was called <persName>Hō-ō</persName> if he became a monk, and that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
looked like a child because he had not yet peformed Gempuku,
were things that unfortunately <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> did not know.
</p>
<p>
Now the former <persName>Uhyōye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>
had ordered his brothers <persName>Nori-yori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> with an
army of sixty thousand men to march against <persName>Kiso</persName> and subdue
him, and they had already started, but when they heard that
war had broken out in the Capital, and that the Palaces of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> had been burnt, and the
whole country was plunged in gloom, they thought it
inadvisable to begin more fighting at present, and halted their
men near <placeName>Atsuta</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName>. Then <persName>Kunai
Hangwan Kintomo</persName> and <persName>Tonai Hangwan Tokinari</persName>, members of
the bodyguard of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName>, came down to <placeName>Owari</placeName>
to report all that had happened in the Capital, and when
<persName>Noriyori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> heard their tidings, they advised them
thus: "It were better that <persName>Kintomo</persName> should go down to
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName> to report the matter direct to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, for with a
messenger, who does not know all the details of the matter,
trouble is likely to arise."
</p>
<p>
As all his retainers had been killed in the recent fighting
and he had none else left, <persName>Kintomo</persName> hastened down to <placeName>Kama-
kura</placeName> accompanied by his young heir <persName>Kunaidokoro Kinnari</persName>, a
boy of fifteen."This is all owing to the folly of <persName>Tsuzumi
Hangwan</persName>; pronounced <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, "and it is through him
that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> has been thus grieved, and so many
venerable priests have been put to death. If such worthless
<pb n="109" xml:id="p123-109"/>

fellows as this are employed as messengers, disturbances will
never cease in the Empire." When this was reported to
<persName>Tomoyasu</persName>, he hurried to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> with the utmost speed, and
argued his case most persistently with <persName>Kajiwara Heizo
Kagetoki</persName>, begging him to intercede with <persName>Yoritomo</persName>; but
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> refused to see him, however often he begged an
audience, so that at last he returned in disgrace to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>,
where, somewhat in danger of his life, he lived in obscurity
somewhere near <placeName>Inari</placeName>. <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>, thus at open war
with <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, immediately sent messengers to the <placeName>Western
Provinces</placeName> inviting the <orgName>Heike</orgName> to return again to the Capital. that
both together might make common cause against <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>.
On hearing this both <persName>Munemori</persName> and all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were much
rejoiced, but <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori</persName> gave his opinion to the
contrary: "Even when things have come to such a pass,” he
said, "how are we to join with <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>? If we should
return to the Capital with our <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the Three Sacred
Treasures, should we not have to lay down our arms and
make humble surrender?", So <persName>Munemori</persName> rejected the
advances of <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, but <persName>Kiso</persName>, on his part, did not believe it
final.
</p>
<p>
One day the <persName>Kwampaku Motofusa</persName> called <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> and
said to him: "<persName>Kiyomori Nyudō</persName> was a man of evil conduct,
it is true, but in him there was at the same time some
extraordinary virtue, through which he was enabled to govern
the Empire peaceably for twenty years. Bad conduct alone
cannot rule the Empire, so it would be well if you were to
pardon those <persName>Courtiers</persName> whom you have put in prison."
<persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, even though he was savage Eastern Barbarian, saw
the wisdom of this and acted accordingly.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Motofusa's</persName> son <persName>Moroie</persName>, who was at that time only
<persName>Chūnagon</persName> of the lower third rank, was, by the plan of <persName>Yoshi-
naka</persName>, made <persName>Daijin</persName> and <persName>Sesshō</persName>, but, as at that time there was
no office of <persName>Daijin</persName> vacant, he borrowed the rank from
<persName>Tokudaiji-dono</persName>, who was <persName>Naidaijin</persName> and <persName>Sadaishō</persName>, in conse-
<pb n="110" xml:id="p124-110"/>

quence of which people called the new <persName>Sessho</persName>, <persName>Kari-no-Daijin</persName>
or 'the Minister of Borrowed Rank.' On the tenth day of
the twelfth month the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> left the <placeName>Gojo Palace</placeName> and proceeded
to the residence of <persName>Daizen-no-taiyu Naritada</persName> in <placeName>Rokujō</placeName>. On the
thirteenth day a recital of the <title>Shingon Sutras</title> was held in the
Palace, and on that day also an appointment of officials was
held, the nominations being made entirely at the will of <persName>Kiso</persName>.
So the <persName>He ke</persName> held the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> the
Eastern, while <persName>Kiso</persName> lorded it in the Capital; just as <persName>Omō</persName> seized
the supremacy and ruled the country for eighteen years
between the former and latter dynasties of <placeName>Kan</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
As all the barriers were closed no taxes could be paid,
and as their yearly revenues were cut off, everyone in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>
was as uncomfortable as a fish in shallow water. And so the
year ended in anxiety, and the third year of Ju-ei began.

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>On the first day of the New Year of the third year of
Ju-ei the customary reception of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> and
Audience of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> were not held, for the mansion of
<persName>Daizen-no-taiyū Naritada</persName>, which the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was using as his
temporary Palace, was not considered suitable. The <persName>Heike</persName>
also welcomed the New Year by the shore of <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in
<placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, but though the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was present, the Festival of
the Setchie was not held, nor the Imperial Worship of Heaven
and Earth. No envoys brought the tribute of fish from
<placeName>Tsukushi</placeName>, nor did the time-honoured messengers arrive from
<placeName>Yoshino</placeName>. All the <persName>Courtiers</persName> lamented the disorder of the times,
declaring that in the Capital, however, things could not be so
bad. Spring had now come, and though the sea breezes blew
softly and the sunshine was warm and genial, the <persName>Heike Nobles</persName>
still shivered like tropical birds amid the ice. Thus they spent
the long-drawn tedious hours in talk and reminiscence of their
pleasant life in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>; of the times of the blossoming and
fading of the various trees and flowers, of the cherry blooms
and the moonlight nights, of their verses and music and games
of foot-ball and archery, the competitions of painting and
writing stanzes on fans, and all their elegant diversions with
insects and grasses; and as they lingered over the recollections
of all these lost delights their hearts were filled with sadness.

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>THE CROSSING OF THE UJIKAWA.</head>
<p>On the eleventh day of the first month <persName>Kiso Sama-no-kami
Yoshinaka</persName> proceeded to the Palace of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> and announced
<pb n="112" xml:id="p126-112"/>

that he was about to start for the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> to subdue
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and on the thirteenth day he was just setting forth
from the Capital when word was brought to him that <persName>Uhyōhe-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> had despatched a large force of many
myriads of horsemen under the command of <persName>Noriyori</persName> and
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> to chastize him for h's outrageous conduct, and
that they had already reached the provinces of <placeName>Mino</placeName> and <placeName>Ise</placeName>.
Much astonished at this news, <persName>Kiso</persName> at once ordered the bridges
at <placeName>Seta</placeName> and <placeName>Uji</placeName> to be destroyed and his forces to be divided to
meet the foe. Since he had not many men left by this time, he
sent eight hundred horsemen under <persName>Imai-no-Shirō Kanehira</persName> to
the bridge at <placeName>Seta</placeName> as his main army, while a smaller force of
five hundred under <persName>Nishina</persName>, <persName>Takanashi</persName>, and <persName>Yamada-no-Jirō</persName>
was ordered to march to that at <placeName>Uji</placeName>. His uncle <persName>Shida-no-Saburo Yoshinori</persName> also rode off to <placeName>Imoarai</placeName> with three hundred
men.
</p>
<p>
Now the main body of the Eastern forces was under the
command of <persName>Kaba-no-Onzōshi Noriyori</persName>, while the lesser army
was led by <persName>Kurō Onzōshi Yoshitsune</persName>, while ranking after these
were thirty-six great Nobles, the whole army numbering some
sixty thousand horsemen. <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had at this time two
famous horses named <persName>Ikezuki</persName> and <persName>Surusumi</persName>, and <persName>Kajiwara
Genda Kagesue</persName> greatly coveted <persName>Ikezuki</persName> and asked that it
might be given him for this campaign, but <persName>Yoritomo</persName> answered
that he was keeping it in case he might wish to ride it himself,
and presented him with <persName>Surusumi</persName> instead. A little while
afterwards <persName>Sasaki Shirō Takatsuna</persName> of the province of <placeName>Ōmi</placeName> came
to bid him farewell, and <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> gave <persName>Ikezuki</persName> to him,
saying: Remember that there are many who desire this
horse, so look well to him." <persName>Sasaki</persName> bowed low in obeisance
and replied: "On this horse I will be the first to cross the
<placeName>Ujikawa</placeName>; if you hear that I am dead, you will know that
someone else has crossed before me, but if you learn that I still
live, then rest certain that <persName>Takatsuna</persName> has crossed before all the
rest." "These are strong words ", muttered all the <roleName>Nobles</roleName>, '
<pb n="113" xml:id="p127-113"/>

both great and small, who were in attendance, as <persName>Sasaki</persName>
retired.
</p>
<p>
So, leaving <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> behind, this great host started for
the West, some crossing over <placeName>Ashigara</placeName> and some over <placeName>Hakone</placeName>,
according to the will of their leaders, and <persName>Kajiwara Genda
Kagesue</persName>, drawing aside a little, ascended to a high place at
<placeName>Ukishima-ga-hara</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName>, and viewed all
their horses as they passed by, each with its varying saddle and
trappings, both in profile and head-on. As he thus scrutinized'
the seemingly endless procession of steeds <persName>Kajiwara</persName> was greatly
pleased that he saw none that could compare with his own
mount <persName>Surusumi</persName>, when his eye fell on a splendid horse that he
recognised at once as <persName>Ikezuki</persName>. His saddle was inlaid with gold
and his crupper gaily decorated with many tassels, and he
foamed at the mouth as he champed the bright-polished bit.
He had many grooms to lead him, but even so his mettle could
not be entirely curbed, for he reared and caracolled as he
advanced. <persName>Kajiwara</persName> came forward and asked the attendants
whose horse he was. It is the horse of <persName>Sasaki dono</persName>"; they
replied- "Which <persName>Sasaki</persName> does it belong to ", he continued;
"<persName>Saburo</persName> or <persName>Shirō</persName>?" "It is the steed of <persName>Shirō Dono</persName>";
answered the attendants as they passed on. At this <persName>Kagesue</persName>-
felt bitter resentment, for it was most mortifying to be thus
passed over in favour of his fellow-retainer <persName>Sasaki</persName>. First he
thought he would rush on to the Capital and engage in mortal'
combat with <persName>Kiso's Four Deva Kings</persName>, <persName>Imai</persName>, <persName>Higuchi</persName>, <persName>Tate</persName> and
<persName>Nenoi</persName>, or else die fighting with one of the famous
championsof the <orgName>Heike</orgName> in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, but this seemed, on
second thoughts, a vain revenge, and so he stood
mutteringand raging and waiting for <persName>Sasaki</persName>, pondering the while what a
loss it would be to <persName>Yoritomo</persName> should two of his stoutest retainers
thus fall on each other and do each other to death. Meanwhile
<persName>Sasaki</persName> himself came along quite unsuspecting, and <persName>Kajiwara</persName>,
uncertain whether to ride at him headlong or to come up
alongside and grapple, thus addressed him: "How is it,
<pb n="114" xml:id="p128-114"/>

<persName>Sasaki Dono</persName>, that our lord has come to present you with
<persName>Ikezuki</persName> ?" Whereupon <persName>Sasaki</persName>, perceiving that <persName>Kagesue</persName> too
had coveted the horse, replied thus: "When I set out on this
campaign I felt quite sure that the enemy would destroy the
bridges at <placeName>Seta</placeName> and <placeName>Uji</placeName>, and that I should want a good horse
to swim the river; but as I had not such an one, I greatly
desired <persName>Ikezuki</persName>. Hearing, however, that you had asked for
him and been refused, I knew that a fellow like myself would
have no chance, and so, in spite of the risk of our lord's anger
afterwards, I won over the grooms and stole his precious steed.
What do you think of that, <persName>Kajiwara Dono</persName>?" Disarmed by
this retort, <persName>Kajiwara</persName> burst into a laugh and replied: "Ah, I
see, I too ought to have stolen him." Now this horse that
<persName>Takatsuna</persName> had received was of large and powerful build, four
shaku eight sun in height, and its colour was a dark chestnut,
and as it was fierce and would bite anyone, man or horse, who
came near it, it had been named <persName>Ikezuki</persName> (Quick-biter).
<persName>Kajiwara's</persName> horse was also large and strong, no whit inferior to
the other, and on account of its very black colour had been
named <persName>Surusumi</persName> (Ink-black).
</p>
<p>
From the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName> the army was divided into its
two parts, and the larger body, consisting of some thirty-five
thousand horsemen under <persName>Noriyori</persName>, pitched their camp at
<placeName>Noji-Shinohara</placeName> in <placeName>Ōmi</placeName>. With <persName>Noriyori</persName> were also <persName>Takeda-no-Tarō</persName>, <persName>Kagami-no-Jirō</persName>, <persName>Ichijō-no-Jirō</persName>, <persName>Itagaki-no-Saburo</persName>, <persName>Inamo-no-Sabur</persName>, <persName>Hangai-no-Jirō</persName>, <persName>Kumagai-no-Jirō</persName>, and <persName>Inomata-no-Koheiroku</persName>. The smaller force of twenty-five thousand men under
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, with whom were also <persName>Yasuda-no-Saburō</persName>, <persName>Ouchi-no-Tarō</persName>, <persName>Hatakeyama-no-Shōji Jirō</persName>, <persName>Kajiwara Genda</persName>, <persName>Sasaki Shirō</persName>,
<persName>Kasuya-no-Tōda</persName>, <persName>Shibuya-no-Uma-no-suke</persName> and <persName>Hirayama-no-Mushadokoro</persName>, passed through the province of <placeName>Iga</placeName> and pressed
upon the bridge at <placeName>Uji</placeName>. Now after destroying the bridges at
<placeName>Seta</placeName> and <placeName>Uji</placeName>, the enemy had planted sharp stakes in the
riverbed and made fast a great hawser in the stream together with a
floating boom ot tree trunks to obstruct the crossing. It was
<pb n="115" xml:id="p129-115"/>

now the twentieth day of the first month and the snow had
melted on the slopes of Mount <placeName>Hira</placeName> and <placeName>Shiga</placeName>, while the ice of
the valleys below mingled with it and rushed down in torrents
of water. The <placeName>Ujikawa</placeName> rose high in spate, and its white capped
waves surged tumultuously as the boiling flood rushed down
between its banks with a roar like a waterfall. As the chilly
dawn broke the river-mist hung h.avy over the water, so that
none could clearly discern the colour either of the horses or
the armour of their riders. Then the commander <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
rode up to the bank of the river, and wishing to try the
courage of his men, with a glance at the foaming torrent, called
'out: "Shall we turn off to <placeName>Yodo</placeName> or <placeName>Imoarai</placeName>, or shall we go
round by <placeName>Kawachiji</placeName>? Or what do you think of waiting till
the flood abates?" Then <persName>Hatakeyama Shōji Shigetada</persName> of the
province of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, who was then but twenty-one years old,
stood forth and said: "This river is one that we have often
spoken of at <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, and is no unknown stream to baffle
us; and moreover, as it flows out directly from the lake of
<placeName>Omi</placeName>, its waters will not quickly subside, however long you
may wait, and as for building a bridge, who is there who can
do such a thing? In the battle that was fought here in the era
of Jishō, <persName>Ashikaga Matataro Tadatsuna</persName> crossed over, and he
was but a youth of seventeen years, so here is no matter for
god or devil. I, <persName>Shigetada</persName> will be the first in the flood.
</p>
<p>
And as he and his band of five hundred followers were pushing
together into the waves, two warriors were seen to gallop forth
from the point of <placeName>Tachibana-no-kojima</placeName> at the north-east of the
<placeName>Byōdō-in</placeName>: they were <persName>Kajiwara Genda Kagesue</persName> and <persName>Sasaki
Shirō Takatsuna</persName>. Each had made up his mind to be the first
across, though no sign of their determination was visible to the
onlookers: <persName>Kajiwara</persName> was about three yards in front of <persName>Sasaki</persName>.
"<persName>Kajiwara Dono</persName>! Your saddle-girth seems to be loose;
this is the greatest river in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, so you had
better tighten it up." Thus warned, <persName>Kajiwara</persName> dropped the
reins on to his horse's mane, kicked his feet from the stirrups,
<pb n="116" xml:id="p130-116"/>

and, leaning forward in the saddle, loosened the girth and
tightened it afresh. While he was thus engaged, however,
<persName>Sasaki</persName> rode on past him and leapt his horse into the river.
<persName>Kajiwara</persName>, thinking he had been tricked, immediately sprang in
after him. "Ho! <persName>Sasaki Dono</persName> ", shouted <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, "take
care if you want to be famous; there is a great hawser at the
bottom of the river. Look out!” At this <persName>Sasaki</persName> drew his
sword and cut through the rope as it caught his horse's feet,
and in spite of the strength of the current, as he was mounted
on the finest horse in the land, he rode straight through the
river and leapt up on to the farther bank. <persName>Kajiwara's</persName> horse
<persName>Surusumi</persName>, however, was swept aside by the rush of the water,
and his rider reached land some distance farther down-stream.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Sasaki</persName>, rising high in his stirrups, shouted with a loud
voice: <persName>Sasaki Shirō Takatsuna</persName>, fourth son of <persName>Sasaki Saburō
Yoshihide</persName> of <placeName>Omi</placeName>, descended in the ninth generation from <persName>Uda
Tennō</persName>, is the first over the <placeName>Ujikawa</placeName>!" <persName>Hatakeyama</persName>, who
was leading his five hundred men across, had not gone far
when his horse was struck deep in the head by an arrow shot
by <persName>Yamada-no-Jiro</persName> from the other bank, and reared violently,
upon which, using his bow as a staff, he slid off into the stream,
only to find the rushing waters sweep right over his head.
Nothing daunted by this he vigorously breasted the current,
and diving through the waves swam across; but just as he was
about to scramble up the bank he felt someone drag at him
from behind. "Who is that?" he called. "<persName>Shigechika</persName>!"
was the answer. "<persName>Ogushi</persName>?" "The same." Now <persName>Hatake-
yama</persName> had been sponsor at the <term>Gempuku</term> of <persName>Ogushi Jirō Shige-
chika</persName>. The current is so strong that my horse has been
washed away and I have no strength to go any farther."
“Ah, I always have to help you fellows"; replied <persName>Hatake-
yama</persName>, as he gripped <persName>Ogushi</persName> and flung him by main force
upon to the bank. The young man, immediately recovering
himself, sprang erect, and drawing his sword, laid it to his
forehead, shouting loudly:" '<persName>Ogushi-no-Jirō Shigechika</persName> of
<pb n="117" xml:id="p131-117"/>

<placeName>Musashi</placeName> is the first to cross the <placeName>Ujikawa</placeName> on foot!
Whereat
all who heard it, both friends and foes, burst out into a roar of
laughter. <persName>Hatakeyama</persName>, mounting another horse, shouted his
warcry and spurred fiercely against the ranks of the foe,
when to meet him there came a single horseman clad in an
embroidered hitatare and a suit of armour laced with scarlet,
riding a dappled horse with a gold-mounted saddle. In answer
to <persName>Hatakeyama's</persName> challenge he gave his name title as:
"<persName>Nagase-no-Hangwan-dai Shigetsuna</persName>, à retainer of <persName>Kiso Yoshi-
naka</persName>." Thinking to make him the first sacrifice to the god
of battles that day, <persName>Hatakeyama</persName> rode up alongside him and
grappled, pulling him from his horse and squeezing him against
the pommel of his saddle, where he twisted his head and cut it
off without more ado, passing it over to <persName>Honda-no-Jirō</persName>, who
fastened it to the left side of his saddle. After this <persName>Kiso's</persName> men
who were guarding the bridge kept up a defensive fight for a
while, but when all the Eastern army had crossed over and
advanced to the attack, they gave way and fled toward
<placeName>Kobatayama</placeName> and <placeName>Fushimi</placeName>. At <placeName>Seta</placeName> also, by the strategy of
<persName>Inamo-no-Saburō Shigenari</persName>, the other army passed over the
river at the ford of <placeName>Gugo</placeName> at <placeName>Tagami</placeName>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3" xml:id="v9_ch3">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT THE RIVER KAMO.</head>
<p>After he had gained this victory, <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> at once sent
messengers to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> with an account of the battle, and as
soon as they arrived in his presence <persName>Yoritomo</persName> put the question:
"How is it with <persName>Sasaki</persName> ?" "He was the first across the <placeName>Uji</placeName>
river;" was the answer: then unrolling his despatch the
messenger read forth : "First across the <placeName>Uji</placeName> river, <persName>Sasaki Shirō
Takatsuna</persName>; second, <persName>Kajiwara Genda Kagesue</persName>.”
</p>
<p>
When he saw that both these positions at <placeName>Uji</placeName> and <placeName>Seta</placeName>
were lost, <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> rode off to the <persName>Hō-o's</persName> Palace at
<placeName>Rokujō</placeName> to say farewell for the last time; but having arrived at
<pb n="118" xml:id="p132-118"/>

the gate, he found that he had nothing particular to say, so he
turned back again, and as a lady, with whom he had lately
fallen in love, happened to live at <placeName>Takakura</placeName> in <placeName>Rokujō</placeName>, he
went in to see her, and as he was very loath to part from her,
he did not emerge at all quickly. Seeing this, a new retainer
of his, named <persName>Echigo-no-Chūta Iemitsu</persName>, called out to his
master: "Why does your Excellency thus deign to waste time
in this dalliance when the august enemy is even now pressing
on the river hard by? That way lies a dog's death; so hasten,
I pray you." As his master still paid on heed to his warnings,
however, <persName>Chuta</persName> at length made up his mind to put an end to
his life, and cut open his belly there and died, with these words
on his lips: "Since it must be, I, <persName>Iemitsu</persName>, will go on before,
and on the <placeName>Mountain of Shide</placeName> will I await my master."
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Kiso</persName>, at last noticing that his faithful retainer had
laid down his life to enforce his warning, tore himself away
from his lady and left the house. At this time the whole force
that he could muster consisted of not more than a hundred men
under <persName>Naba-no-Tarō Hirozumi</persName>, and as they rode out to the
river by <placeName>Rokujō</placeName> to reconnotire, they saw about thirty
horsemen of the enemy coming to meet them, with two warriors
spurring forth in front. These two were <persName>Shioya-no-Gorō
Korehiro</persName> and <persName>Teshikawara-no-Gosaburō Arinao</persName>. Seeing them
<persName>Shioya</persName> at once shouted: "Let us wait until the main body
come up!" "By no means", said <persName>Teshikawara</persName>, "when the
front is broken the rest will soon give way; forward!" and so
both parties rode at each other and the fight began, for the
soldiers of <persName>Yoritomo</persName> aimed at enveloping <persName>Kiso</persName> in the midst of
their ample forces, if he would stay and fight to the last.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> himself, leaving the conduct of the battle to his
subordinates, rode off with five or six retainers to the Palace of
the <persName>Ho-o</persName> in <placeName>Rokujō</placeName>, to guard it against any further perils.
Here <persName>Daizen-no-Taiyū Naritada</persName> had mounted up on to the
eastern wall and was surveying the turmoil outside, his whole
body shaking in the extremity of his terror, when he saw the
<pb n="119" xml:id="p133-119"/>

small band approaching with their helmets hanging loose from
the fight, their bow-hand sleeves flying loose in the wind, and
the white colours of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> displayed. "Alas! how
terrible!" he shrieked, "it is <persName>Kiso</persName> who has come again!
Whereat all the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Ladies-in-waiting</persName>
within, thinking that now at last their hour had come, ran
about wringing their hands and making vows to every god and
<persName>Buddha</persName> they could think of, when the voice of <persName>Naritada</persName> was
heard again :
"It may be the warriors of the East who are
just entering the town, for the insignia they wear are different."
Then the Eastern Commander <persName>Kurō Onzōshi Yoshitsune</persName>, rode
up to the gate and knocked, shouting loudly: <persName>Kurō
Yoshitsune</persName>, younger brother of the former <persName>Uhyōye-no-suke
Yoritomo</persName>, who has broken through the enemy at <placeName>Uji</placeName>, has
arrived to protect the Palace!" When he heard this, <persName>Naritada</persName>
was so overcome with excitement that, as he hastily scrambled
down from the wall he slipt and hurt his back, but so great
was his joy that he did not trouble about the pain, but went on
limping into the Palace and reported the facts to the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, who
was also overjoyed to hear it, and immediately ordered the
gates to be opened.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> was clad that day in a hitatare of red brocade,
and armour of shot purple, while his helmet was surmounted
by upstanding horns. By his side hung a gold-mounted sword,
and twenty four black-and-white arrows were stuck in his
⚫ quiver: the upper half of his bow was wound leftwise with a
strip of paper about an inch wide, which was at this time the
sign of a General Commanding. Then the <persName>Ho-o</persName> went out to
the middle gate, and viewed them through a lattice window,
exclaiming : "Ah, what a brave show they make! Let us
hear their names and titles."
</p>
<p>
Then the six captains declared themselves; <persName>Tai-Shōgun
Kuro Yoshitsune</persName>, <persName>Yasuda Saburo Yoshisada</persName>, <persName>Hatakeyama.
Shōji Jirō Shigetada</persName>, <persName>Kajiwara Genda Kagesue</persName>, <persName>Sasaki Shirō
Takatsuna</persName>, <persName>Shibuya Umanosuke</persName>; and through they may have
<pb n="120" xml:id="p134-120"/>

differed in their armour and trappings, in bearing and courage
none was inferior to the others.
</p>
<p>
Then, after a low obeisance <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> spoke as follows:
"In order to punish the lawless conduct of <persName>Kiso</persName>, the former
<persName>Uhyōye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> has sent out an army
of sixty thousand men under the command of <persName>Noriyori</persName> and
myself, but as <persName>Noriyori</persName> is advancing by way of <placeName>Seta</placeName>, as yet
none of his men have entered the Capital. I, having overcome
the forces of the enemy at <placeName>Uji</placeName>, have straitway hastened to
protect this Palace, while my men are even now engaged with
<persName>Kiso</persName> to cut him off as he is trying to flee up the river, and I
doubt not have already seized him." At these straightforward
and informal words the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was much gratified and relieved:
"See that you guard this Palace well", he directed, "lest <persName>Kiso</persName>
return again and commit more violence." <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> bent
low in assent, and ere long his men had come up to the number
of ten thousand horsemen, who were drawn up to keep watch
on all four sides of the Palace.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile <persName>Kiso</persName> with twenty of his stoutest followers was
waiting for an opportunity to seize the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> and flee with him
to the West to join the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, but when he saw that his
designs had been anticipated by the strict guard that <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
had placed round the Palace, he started off up the river <placeName>Kamo</placeName>
to escape, and between <placeName>Rokujō</placeName> and <placeName>Sanjō</placeName> he was many times
almost surrounded and slain. Then the tears ran down his
cheeks as he exclaimed: "Ah, if I had only known this, I.
would never have sent <persName>Imai</persName> to <placeName>Seta</placeName>, for from our earliest days
when we played together as children we swore that when we
came to die it should be together; and now, alas! it seems we
are to fall separated from one another.". So riding up the river
to see if he could hear any tidings of <persName>Imai</persName>, the enemy rolled
down on them like the evening mists, and five or six times did
<persName>Kiso</persName> and his little band fling them back between <placeName>Rokujo</placeName> and
<placeName>Sanjo</placeName> until at last he cut through them and reached <placeName>Matsusaka</placeName>
at <placeName>Awataguchi</placeName>. Last year he rode forth from <placeName>Shinano</placeName> with
</p>
<p><pb n="121" xml:id="p135-121"/>

fifty thousand horsemen, now he flees along the river-bed with
but six retainers, already half lost in the melancholy twilight
where lies the nether world.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4" xml:id="v9_ch4">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>THE DEATH OF KISO.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Kiso</persName> had brought with him from <placeName>Shinano</placeName> two
beautiful girls named <persName>Tomoe</persName> and <persName>Yamabuki</persName>, but <persName>Yamabuki</persName>
had fallen sick and stayed behind in the Capital. <persName>Tomoe</persName> had
long black hair and a fair complexion, and her face was very
lovely; moreover she was a fearless rider whom neither the
fiercest horse nor the roughest ground could dismay, and so
dexterously did she handle sword and bow that she was a
match for a thousand warriors, and fit to meet either god or
devil. Many times had she taken the field, armed at all points,
and won matchless renown in encounters with the bravest
captains, and so in this last fight, when all the others had been
slain or had fled, among the last seven there rode <persName>Tomoe</persName>. At
first it was reported that <persName>Kiso</persName> had escaped to the North either
through <placeName>Nagasaka</placeName> by the road to <placeName>Tamba</placeName>, or by the <placeName>Ryūge</placeName>
pass, but actually he had turned back again and ridden off
toward <placeName>Seta</placeName>, to see if he could hear aught of the fate of <persName>Imai
Kanehira</persName>. <persName>Imai</persName> had long valiantly held his position at <placeName>Seta</placeName>
till the continued assaults of the enemy reduced his eight
hundred men to but fifty, when he rolled up his banner and
rode back to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> to ascertain the fate of his lord; and thus
it happened that the two fell in with each other by the shore
at <placeName>Ōtsu</placeName>. Recognizing each other when they were yet more
than a hundred yards away, they spurred their horses and
came together joyfully.
</p>
<p>
Seizing <persName>Imai</persName> by the hand, <persName>Kiso</persName> burst forth: "I was so
anxious about you that I did not stop to fight to the death in
the <placeName>Rokujo Kawara</placeName>, but turned my back on a host of foes and
hastened off here to find you."
"How can I express my
<pb n="122" xml:id="p136-122"/>

gratitude for my lord's consideration?" replied <persName>Imai</persName>; "I too
would have died in the defence of <placeName>Seta</placeName>, but I feared for my
lord's uncertain fate, and thus it was that I fled hither."
"Then our ancient pledge will not be broken and we shall die
together," said <persName>Kiso</persName>, “and now unfurl your banner, for a sign
to our men who have scattered among these hills." So <persName>Imai</persName>
unfurled the banner, and many of their men who had fled from
the Capital and from <placeName>Seta</placeName> saw it and rallied again, so that they
soon had a following of three hundred horse. 'With this
band our last fight will be a great one ", shouted <persName>Kiso</persName> joyfully,
"who leads yon great array? "<persName>Kai-n-Ichijō Jirō</persName>, my
lord." "And how many has he, do you think?" "About
six thousand, it seems." "Well matched!" replied <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>,
"if we must die, what death could be better than to fall
outnumbered by valiant enemies? Forward then!"
</p>
<p>
That day <persName>Kiso</persName> was arrayed in a hitatare of red brocade
and a suit of armour laced with Chinese silk; by his side hung
a magnificent sword mounted in silver and gold, and his helmet
was surmounted by long golden horns. Of his twenty four
eagle-feathered arrows, most had been shot away in the
previous fighting, and only a few were left, drawn out high
from the quiver, and he grasped his rattan-bound bow by the
middle as he sat his famous grey charger, fierce as a devil, on
a saddle mounted in gold. Rising high in his stirrups he cried
with a loud voice: "<persName>Kiso-no-Kwanja</persName> you have often heard of;
now you see him before your eyes! <persName>Sama-no-kami</persName> and <persName>Iyo-no-kami</persName>, <persName>Asahi Shōgun</persName>, <persName>Minamoto Yoshinaka</persName> am I! Come!
<persName>Kai-no-Ichijo Jiro</persName>! Take my head and show it to <persName>Hyōye-no-
suke Yoritomo</persName> !' "Hear, men!" shouted <persName>Ichijō-no-Jirō</persName> in
response; "On to the attack! This is their great Captain!
See that he does not escape you now!" And the whole force
charged against <persName>Kiso</persName> to take him. Then <persName>Kiso</persName> and his three
hundred fell upon their six thousand opponents in the death
fury, cutting and slashing and swinging their blades in every
direction until at last they broke through on the farther side,
<pb n="123" xml:id="p137-123"/>

but with their little band depleted to only fifty horsemen, when
<persName>Doi-no-Jiro Sanehira</persName> came up to support their foes with
another force of two thousand. Flinging themselves on these
they burst through them also, after which they successively
penetrated several other smaller bands of a hundred or two
who were following in reserve. But now they were reduced to
but five survivors, and among these <persName>Tomoe</persName> still held her place.
</p>
<p>
Calling her to him <persName>Kiso</persName> said : As you are a woman, it were
better that you now make your escape.
I have made up my ·
mind to die, either by the hand of the enemy or by mine own,
and how would <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> be shamed if in his last fight he
died with a woman?' Even at these strong words, however,
<persName>Tomoe</persName> would not forsake him, but still feeling full of fight, she
replied: "Ah, for some bold warrior to match with, that <persName>Kiso</persName>
might see how fine a death I can die." And she drew aside
her horse and waited. Presently <persName>Onda-no-Hachirō Moroshige</persName>
of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, a strong and valiant samurai, came riding up with
thirty followers, and <persName>Tomoe</persName>, immediately dashing into them,
flung herself upon <persName>Onda</persName> and grappling with him dragged him
from his horse, pressed him calmly against the pommel of her
saddle and cut off his head. Then stripping off her armour
she fled away to the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>. <persName>Tezuka do-Tarō</persName> was
killed and <persName>Tezuka-no-Bettō</persName> took to flight, leaving <persName>Kiso</persName> alone
with <persName>Imai no-Shirō</persName>. "Ah", exclaimed <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, "my
armour that I am never wont to feel at all seems heavy on me
today." "But you are not yet tired, my lord, and your horse
is still fresh, so why should your armour feel heavy? If it is
because you are discouraged at having none of your retainers
left, remember that I, <persName>Kanehira</persName>, am equal to a thousand hor: e-
men, and I have yet seven or eight arrows left in my quiver:
so let me hold back the foe while my lord escapes to that
pine-wood of <placeName>Awazu</placeName> that we see yonder, that there under the
trees he may put an end to his life in peace." "Was it for this
that I turned my back on my enemies in <placeName>Rokujō-kawara</placeName> and
did not die then ?" returned <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>; "by no means will
<pb n="124" xml:id="p138-124"/>

we part now, but meet our fate together." And he reined his
horse up beside that of <persName>Imai</persName> towards the foe, when <persName>Kanehira</persName>,
alighting from his horse, seized his master's bridle and burst
into tears: "However great renown a warrior may have
gained", he pleaded, “an unworthy death is a lasting shame.
My lord is weary and his charger also, and if, as may be, he
meet his death at the hands of some low retainer, how
disgraceful that it should be said that <persName>Kiso Dono</persName>, known
through all <placeName>Nippon</placeName> as the Demon Warrior' had been slain by
some nameless fellow, so listen to reason, I pray you, and get
away to the pines over there." So <persName>Kiso</persName>, thus persuaded, rode
off toward the pine-wood of <placeName>Awazu</placeName>. Then <persName>Ima-no-Shirō</persName>,
turning back, charged into a party of fifty horsemen, shouting:
"I am <persName>Imai Shiro Kanchira</persName>, foster-brother of <persName>Kiso Dono</persName>, aged
thirty-three. Even <persName>Yoitomo</persName> at <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> knows my name;
so take my head and show it to him, anyone who can!" And
he quickly fitted the eight shafts he had left to his bow and
sent them whirring into the enemy, bringing down eight of
them from their horses, either dead or wounded. Then,
drawing his sword, he set on at the rest, but none would face
him in combat hand-to-hand : "Shoot him down! Shoot
him down!" they cried as they let fly a hail of arrows at him,
but so good was his armour that none could pierce it, and once
more he escaped unwounded.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> rode off alone toward <placeName>Awazu</placeName>, and
it was the twenty third day of the first month. It was now
nearly dark and all the land was coated with thin ice, so that
none could distinguish the deep ricefields, and he had not gone
far before his horse plunged heavily into the muddy ooze
beneath. Right up to the neck it floundered, and though <persName>Kiso</persName>
plied whip and spur with might and main, it was all to no
purpose, for he could not stir it.
Even in this plight he still
thought of his retainer, and was turning to see how it fared
with <persName>Imai</persName>, when <persName>Miura-no-Ishida Jirō Tamehisa</persName> of <placeName>Sagami</placeName> rode
up and shot an arrow that struck him in the face under his
<pb n="125" xml:id="p139-125"/>

helmet. Then as the stricken warrior fell forward in his saddle
so that his crest bowed over his horse's head, two of <persName>Ishida's</persName>
retainers fell upon him and struck off his head. Holding it
high on the point of a sword <persName>Ishida</persName> shouted loudly: "<persName>Kiso
Yoshinaka</persName>, known through the length and breadth of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>
as the Demon Warrior', has been killed by <persName>Miura-no-Ishida
Jirō Tamehisa</persName>." <persName>Imai</persName> was still fighting when these words fell
on his ears, but when he saw that his master was indeed slain
he cried out: "Alas, for whom now have I to fight? See,
you fellows of the <placeName>East Country</placeName>, I will show you how the
mightiest champion in <placeName>Nippon</placeName> can end his life!" And he
thrust the point of his sword in his mouth and flung himself
headlong from his horse, so that he was pierced through
and died.

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>HIGUCHI IS PUT TO DEATH.</head>
<p><persName>Imai's</persName> elder brother, <persName>Higuchi Jirō Kanemitsu</persName>, had gone
to the stronghold of <placeName>Nagano</placeName> in <placeName>Kawachi</placeName> with five hundred.
horsemen to take <persName>Jūrō Kurando Yukiie</persName> and put him to death,
but not finding him there, and hearing that he was at <placeName>Nagusa</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Kii</placeName>, he was following him to that province,
when he learned of the fighting in the Capital and immediately
retraced his steps thither. When he came to the bridge of
<placeName>Owatari</placeName> at <placeName>Yodo</placeName> there met him one of the retainers of his
brother <persName>Imai</persName>, who greeted him thus: "Whither then is it that
your Excellency is going? There is war in the Capital and
our lord has been slain. <persName>Imai</persName> also has fallen by his own
hand." When <persName>Higuchi</persName> thus heard that all was lost, he burst
into tears, and then turned and addressed his men : "Hearken
to me, sirs! All of you who have a mind to repay the
gratitude you owe our lord, make your escape to whatever
place you may, and as begging pilgrims pray that he may
<pb n="126" xml:id="p140-126"/>

obtain enlightenment in the world to come, As for me,
I go to die in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, and once more to atttend our lord
on the <placeName>Dark Road</placeName>, for it is my wish to be with <persName>Imai</persName> in
that world." And with that he rode on again, and as his
followers withdrew hither and thither by the way, his force of
five hundred men melted away so that when he passed the
south <placeName>Toba</placeName> gate, scarcely twenty were left. Now when the
enemy heard that <persName>Higuchi Jirō Kanemitsu</persName> was just about to
enter the city, all their great captains of noble lineage rode out
with their men to <placeName>Shichijō</placeName>, <placeName>Shujaku</placeName>, <placeName>Tsukurimichi</placeName> and
<placeName>Yotsuzuka</placeName> to meet him. Then one of <persName>Higuchi's</persName> men, <persName>Chigo-no-Taro Mitsuhiro</persName>, spurring his charger against a great mass
of foemen who were waiting at <placeName>Yotsuzuka</placeName>, rose in his stirrups
and shouted; "Are there any of the retainers of <persName>Ichijo Jirō
Dono</persName> of <placeName>Kai</placeName> present among you?" At this a great laugh
rose from the other side. 'Will you fight with none but the
followers of <persName>Ichijō Jirō</persName> then?" they returned; "take all
comers! don't pick your men ! ' "It was not that I might
choose my opponents that I spoke," replied <persName>Mitsuhiro</persName>,
declaring his titles in answer to their laughter; "I am <persName>Chino-no-Taro Mitsuhiro</persName>, son of <persName>Chino-no-taiyu Mitsuie</persName> of <placeName>Kamino-
miya</placeName> in <placeName>Suwo</placeName> of the province of <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, and I have left my
two children behind me at home; and that they might be
taught what a death their father died, whether good or ill, I
wished to meet my fate before the eyes of my younger brother
<persName>Shichiro</persName> who serves in the train of my lord <persName>Ichijō Jirō</persName> of <placeName>Kai</placeName>.
There is none that I fear!" And riding at one after another
he cut down three men, and grappling with a fourth, both fell
together and stabbed each other to death.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Higuchi</persName> had many friends among the party of
<persName>Kodama</persName>, and some of them came to him and persuaded him
thus: "It is but natural that the friendships that we warriors
bear to each other should at times result in our sparing one
another's lives, and so now for the sake of our former intimacy
we would save you from death. Though among <persName>Kiso's</persName>
<pb n="127" xml:id="p141-127"/>

captains there are none to equal his <persName>Four Deva Kings</persName> <persName>Imai</persName>,
<persName>Higuchi</persName>, <persName>Tate</persName> and <persName>Nenoi</persName>, yet take it not to heart that <persName>Kiso</persName> has
been slain and <persName>Imai</persName> has taken his life, for if you will now give
yourself up, as a reward for our recent prowess we can plead
for your life." So, tempted by this promise, bold veteran as
<persName>Higuchi</persName> was, in accordance with the decree of destiny and
unm ndful of the dictates of chivalry, he shamelessly
surrendered to the <persName>Kodama</persName> clan. When this came to the ears of
the Commanders <persName>Noriyori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> they forthwith sent
a petition to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> on his behalf, but all the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and
<roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Ladies-in waiting</persName> even to the maidens of tender
years opposed it with one accord, crying out that when <persName>Kiso</persName>
had stormed the <placeName>Hōjujiden</placeName> and burnt it, thereby cau ing the
death of many venerable priests of high rank, <persName>Imai</persName> and
<persName>Higuchi</persName> were the names that they had heard shouted
everywhere, and that it was a great mistake to spare the life of such
a fellow. And as in face of this nothing more could be done,
<persName>Higuchi</persName> was at last condemned to die.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty second day the new <persName>Sesshō</persName> was removed
from office and the former one restored to his place: that he
should have held the office for the transient period of but sixty
days must have seemed like à dream from which he had not
yet awakened; though in former days there was the case of the
<persName>Kwampaku Michikane</persName> who was in office for but seven days
before he died. Still, as during even this short period of sixty
days both the Setchie Festival and also an Appointment of
Officials had been held, he had something to think about in
after years.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty fourth day the heads of <persName>Kiso Sama-no-kami</persName>
and four others were brought into the Capital and carried
through the streets. Though <persName>Higuchi</persName> had yielded himself as a
prisoner, yet as he begged to be allowed to accompany them,
permission was given, and he escorted the heads of his
companions clad in a dark blue hitatare and high eboshi. He was
put to death on the next day, the twenty fifth; for though
<pb n="128" xml:id="p142-128"/>

<persName>Noriyori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> many times interceded for his life, all
felt that to spare one of <persName>Kiso's Four Deva Kings</persName> was as
dangerous as keeping a tiger at large. We have heard how in
<placeName>China</placeName>, when the power of <placeName>Shin</placeName> declined and all the <persName>Princes</persName>
rose in rebellion like a swarm of bees, <persName>Haikō</persName>, though he
entered the Palace of <placeName>Kanyō</placeName>, did not waste his time in dalliance
with the fair Court Ladies, or stop to seize gold or treasure,
but calmly secured the pass of <placeName>Kwankoku</placeName>, after which he was
able to destroy his enemies at leisure and thus become supreme
in the Empire. So this <persName>Kiso Sama-no-kami</persName>, if he had obeyed
the orders of <persName>Yoritomo</persName> after he entered the Capital, might have
become no less powerful than <persName>Haiko</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Now the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had departed from the coast of <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in
<placeName>Sanuki</placeName> the winter of the year before, and crossed over to the bay
of <placeName>Naniwa</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName> and took up a position between <placeName>Ichi-no tani</placeName>
on the west, where they built a strong fortification, and the
wood of <placeName>Ikuta</placeName> on the east, where the entrance to the fort was
made. Between these points, at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, <placeName>Hyogo</placeName>, <placeName>Itayado</placeName>
and <placeName>Suma</placeName> were encamped all the forces of the eight provinces
of the <placeName>Sanyōdō</placeName> and the six provinces of the <placeName>Nankaidō</placeName>, a total
of a hundred thousand men in all. The position at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>
had a narrow entrance with cliffs on the north and the sea on
the south, while within it was very spacious. The cliffs rose
high and steep, perpendicular as a standing screen, and from
them to the shallows of the beach a strong breastwork was
erected of wood and stone, well protected by palisades, while
beyond it, in the deep water rode their great galleys like a
floating shield. In the towers of the breastwork were stationed
the stout soldiery of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> and <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> in full armour with
bows and arrows in their hands, dense as the evening mists,
while in front of the towers, ten or twelve deep, stood their
horses, fully accoutred with saddle and trappings. Ceaseless
was the roll of their war-drums; the might of their bows was
like the crescent moon, and the 'gleam of their blades was as
the shimmer of the hoar frost in autumn, while their myriad
<pb n="129" xml:id="p143-129"/>

red banners that flew aloft in the spring breezes rose to heaven
like the flames of a conflagration.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6" xml:id="v9_ch6">

<head>SIX BATTLES.</head>
<p>But after the <orgName>Heike</orgName> crossed over to <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> the men
of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> became disaffected, and especially the subordinate
officials in charge of <placeName>Awa</placeName> and <placeName>Sanuki</placeName> broke into open rebellion
and wished to go over to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, but as they had been on
the side of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> right up to this time, they doubted
whether the <orgName>Genji</orgName> would believe in their sudden change of face,
and decided to prove their hostility to their former allies by a
deliberate act of war. Learning therefore that <persName>Kadowaki-no
Hei Chunagon Norimori</persName> and his two sons <persName>Echizen-no Sammi
Michimori</persName> and <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> were at <placeName>Shimotsue</placeName> in
the province of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>, they set sail thither with ten ships of war
to attack them. <persName>Noritsune's</persName> wrath was great. "These are
the fellows," he exclaimed, "who have been living on our
pasture right up till yesterday, and now they have turned
traitor! Kill them all, let none escape! And he put to sea
with his men in a number of small boats, and attacked them
fiercely. Now the <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> men had only intended to shoot a
few arrows at them, as a proof of their rebellion, and then
retire, so when they found themselves attacked thus vigorously
they at once gave way and beat a hasty retreat to the port of
<placeName>Fukura</placeName> in <placeName>Awaji</placeName>. In this island of <placeName>Awaji</placeName> were two <persName>Genji</persName>
chiefs; they were the youngest sons of the late <persName>Rokujō-no-Hangwan Tameyoshi</persName>, <persName>Kamo-no Kwanja Yoshitsugu</persName> and <persName>Awaji-no-Kwanja Yoshihisa</persName>, and under their leadership the rebels
threw up a stronghold and awaited the foe. This availed
nothing under the impetuous onslaught of <persName>Noritsune</persName>, and
<persName>Kamo-no-Kwanja</persName> was killed and <persName>Awaji-no-Kwanja</persName> wounded
and captured, while the remaining two hundred and thirty men
who still resisted were taken and beheaded, their heads being
<pb n="130" xml:id="p144-130"/>

labelled with the names of their captors and sent to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>,
whither <persName>Kadowaki Norimori</persName> also proceeded. His two sons
then crossed over to <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> to deal with one <persName>Kawano-no-Shirō</persName> of <placeName>Iyo</placeName>, who had not obeyed the <orgName>Heike</orgName> summons, the
elder brother <persName>Michimori</persName> soon after arriving before the
stronghold of <placeName>Hanazono</placeName> in <placeName>Awa</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now when <persName>Kawano-no-Shirō Michinobu</persName> of <placeName>Iyo</placeName> heard that
<persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> had arrived at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, he
went over to the province of <placeName>Aki</placeName> to join his maternal uncle
<persName>Nuta-no-Jirō</persName> who lived there, and as soon as <persName>Noritsune</persName> heard it
he started from <placeName>Yashima</placeName> without delay, and reaching <placeName>Mino-
shima</placeName> in <placeName>Bingo</placeName> the same day, on the next he was already
before the fortress of <placeName>Nuta</placeName>. He immediately delivered a
violent assault on the two rebels, with the result that <persName>Nuta</persName> laid
down his arms and surrendered. <persName>Kawano</persName>, however, resisted
stubbornly, and when his five hundred men had been reduced
to fifty, he sallied forth from the walls to make his escape.
Being surrounded by a band of two hundred men under
<persName>Heihachi-hyōye Tamehisa</persName>, one of <persName>Noritsune's</persName> samurai, he
fought until but six of his men were left, and as they were
retreating along a narrow path to gain the shore and evade
their foes by boat, <persName>Sanuki-no-Shichiro Yoshinori</persName>, son of
<persName>Heihachi-hyōye</persName>, a very fine archer, shot down another five so
that only himself and one retainer remained. Then <persName>Yoshinori</persName>,
taking the retainer for his lord, sprang upon him and grappled
with him and would have slain him, when his master turned,
swept off his head as he bent over his retainer, and flung it into
a ricefield. Then he shouted loudly: "I am <persName>Kawano-no-Shirō
Ochi-no-Michinobu</persName> of <placeName>Iyo</placeName>, aged twenty one, and this is the
way I fight. Stop me now, any of you who thinks himself
someone!" And thus eluding them, he escaped with his
retainer to <placeName>Iyo</placeName>. <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName>, though he had been unable to
capture <persName>Kawano</persName>, then returned to <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> with his prisoner
<persName>Nuta-no-Jirō</persName>.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Ama-no-Rokurō Tadahisa</persName> of the province of <placeName>Awa</placeName> also
</p>
<p><pb n="131" xml:id="p145-131"/>

rebelled and went over to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, setting sail for the Capital
with two large warships fully loaded with men and provisions.
As soon as this came to the ears of <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName> in <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>
he set off in pur uit with many small and swift ships, and
overtook <persName>Tadahisa</persName> off <placeName>Nishinomiya</placeName>. Ordering his men to let
none escape, he attacked them fiercely, but <persName>Tadahisa</persName>, fearing
destruction, fled to <placeName>Fukehi</placeName> in <placeName>Izumi</placeName>. Then <persName>Sonobe-no-Hyōye
Tadayasu</persName>, who was not well disposed to the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, when he
heard that <persName>Ama-no-Rokurō</persName> had been thus roughly handled by
<persName>Noritsune</persName> and was in <placeName>Fukehi</placeName>, went thither and joined him with
a hundred hor.emen, and the two allies built a fortress there. to
resist attacks. <persName>Noritsune</persName> soon assaulted it, however, so seeing
no chance of stemming h's vehement onset, they made their
escape to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, leaving a huudred and thirty of their
followers behind, whose heads were duly taken and sent to
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, <persName>Usuki-no-Jirō Koretaka</persName> and <persName>Ogata-no-Saburō
Koreyoshi</persName> of the province of <placeName>Bungo</placeName> joined themselves with
<persName>Kawano-no-Shirō Michinobu</persName>, and assembling two thousand
fighting men, crossed over to <placeName>Bizen</placeName> and established them elves
in the fortress of <placeName>Imaki</placeName> in that Province. News of this soon
reached <persName>Noritsune</persName> at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> and filled him with wrath and
apprehension, so that he was soon on the march to <placeName>Bizen</placeName> with
three thousand horsemen. "The rascals are in some force
there, so we must send a larger army," quoth he at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>,
and when this speech was reported to the rebels, they thought
that many tens of thousands of horsemen were being sent
against them, and the soldiers in the fortress declared that, as
they had already had their fill of fighting and won much fame
and booty, it would be a shame if they were surrounded and
annihilated by overwhelming numbers, so that it would be
better to retire to some safer place and rest themselves awhile.
<persName>Usuki-no-Jirō</persName> and <persName>Ogata-no-Saburō</persName> accordingly hastened back
to <placeName>Bungo</placeName>, while <persName>Kawano</persName> recrossed the sea to <placeName>Iyo</placeName>, and <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName>, seeing that there was no longer any enemy to fight,
<pb n="132" xml:id="p146-132"/>

made his way back to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, to be greatly praised by
<persName>Munemori</persName> and all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> Courtiers for his many successful
expeditions.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7" xml:id="v9_ch7">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>THE MUSTER AT MIKUSA.</head>
<p>On the twenty ninth day of the first month <persName>Noriyori</persName> and
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> proceeded to the Palace of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> to announce
their intention of marching into the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> against
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>; and after receiving the Imperial exhortation to
restore to the Capital the Three Sacred Treasures, the Jewel,
the Sword, and the Mirror, which have been handed down in
the Imperial Family since the Age of the Gods, they made low
obeisance and withdrew.
</p>
<p>
On the fourth day of the second month, being the
anniversary of the death of the <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor Kiyomori</persName>,
the customary Buddhist services were performed at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>.
Thus the days and months had passed in incessant fighting, and
ere they were aware of it the preceding year had glided away
and the ill-omened season of spring had begun. Under more
happy circumstances there would have been a great erecting
of Sotoba and lavish offerings to the priests and <persName>Budhas</persName>, but as
it was the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and Ladies could only assemble for
mourning and lamentation. Soon afterwards an Appointment
of Officials was held at <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> and both priests and
laymen received promotion. Among them <persName>Kadowaki-no-Hei
Chunagon Norimori-no-Kyō</persName> was to be raised to Dainagon of
the Upper Second Rank, but on receiving the intimation of his
advancement from the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> he made this stanza:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Wondering still how it is I am spared from one day to another,</l>
<l>This new honour seems as but a dream of a dream";</l>
</lg>
<p>
in consequence of which his appointment was cancelled.
</p>
<p><pb n="133" xml:id="p147-133"/>

<persName>Suwō-no-suke Morozumi</persName>, the son of the <persName>Secretary of State
Nakahara-no-Moronao</persName> was made Secretary of State, and
<persName>Hyōbu-no-Shō Masaakira</persName> became <persName>Kurando</persName> of the Fifth Rank,
being therefore known as <persName>Kurando-no Shō</persName>. In ancient days
when <persName>Masakado</persName> conquered the eight provinces of the East and
established his capital in the district of <placeName>Soma</placeName> in <placeName>Shimosa</placeName>, he
gave himself the title of <persName>Hei Shinnō</persName>, and created many officials,
but among them a Master of the Records was not found.
The
present occasion, however, was by no means the same; for
though the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> had gone forth from the <placeName>Ancient Capital</placeName>,
he yet held the Imperial Authority and the Three Sacred
Treasures, and so there was nothing irregular in these
appointments to rank and office.
</p>
<p>
When they heard that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had succeeded in fighting
their way back to <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>, their relatives who had been left
behind in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> were filled with joy and encouragement, and
<persName>Kajii-no-Miya</persName>, the <persName>Tendai Zasshu</persName>, often exchanged letters with
his old friend <persName>Nii-no-Sózu Senshin</persName>, who was in the <orgName>Heike</orgName> camp,
in which he declared his sympathy with his friend in exile, but
informed him that things were not yet quiet in the Capital and
so forth, and in one of these letters he sent this verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"All unknown to the world my heart ever yearns for your friendship:</l>
<l>How I long to roam where the moon wanes in the west."</l>
</lg>
<p>
When the <persName>Sōzu</persName> read this he pressed it to his face and burst
into tears.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, as the days and years passed, the thoughts of
<persName>Koniatsu-no-Sammi Chujō Koremori</persName> dwelt ever on his wife
and children whom he had left behind in the Capital and he
was very sad. They could at times send letters to each other
by the hands of merchants, and when he heard of her lonely
life in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> he felt much inclined to try to bring her to
<placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> that they might be together, but when he reflected
on the hard life they led there he could only refrain and
abandon himself to his gloomy thoughts.
</p>
<p><pb n="134" xml:id="p148-134"/>

The <persName>Genji</persName> had intended to begin their attack on <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName>
on the fourth day of the second month, but when they heard
that Buddhist rites were being performed on behalf of the
departed <persName>Nyūdō</persName> they desisted, and as the fifth and sixth days
were unlucky, it was not till the seventh day at six o'clock in
the morning that the battle began on both the eastern and
western entrances of <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
On the fourth day, as it was a lucky one, they had divided
their army into two parts, the main body being commanded by
<persName>Kaba-no-Onzōshi Noriyori</persName> with whom rode the following
captains: <persName>Takeda-no-Tarō Nobuyoshi</persName>, <persName>Kagami-no-Jirō Tomitsu</persName>,
<persName>Kagami-no-Kojirō Nagakiyo</persName>, <persName>Yamana-no-Jirō Noriyoshi</persName>, and
<persName>Yamana-no-Saburo Yoshiyuki</persName>, while in command of the
samurai were <persName>Kajiwara Heizō Kagetoki</persName>, his eldest son <persName>Genda
Kagesue</persName>, his second son <persName>Heiji Kagetaka</persName>, <persName>Kajiwara Saburō
Kageie</persName>, <persName>Inage-no-Saburō Shigenari</persName>, <persName>Hangai-no-Gorō Shigeyuki</persName>,
<persName>Oyama-no-Koshirō Tomomasa</persName>, <persName>Naganuma-no-Gorō Munemasa</persName>,
<persName>Yuki-no-Shichirō Tomomitsu</persName>, <persName>Sanuki-no-Shirōdaiyu Hirotsuna</persName>,

Tadaie</persName>, <persName>Shō-no-Shirō Takaie</persName>, <persName>Shodai-no-Hachiro Yukihira</persName>,
<persName>Kuge-Jirō Shigemitsu</persName>, <persName>Kawara-no-Tarō Takanao</persName>, <persName>Kawara-no-Jirō Morinao</persName>, and <persName>Fujita-no-Saburōdaiyū Yukiyasu</persName> with a
force of some fifty thousand horsemen under them.
</p>
<p>
On the fourth day of the second month at eight o'clock in
the morning they departed from the Capital, and about evening
of the same day they arrived at <placeName>Koyano</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Settsu</placeName> and pitched their camp.
</p>
<p>
The smaller body was under the command of <persName>Kurō
Onzōshi Yoshitsune</persName> and with him were <persName>Yasuda-no-Saburō
Yoshisada</persName>, <persName>Ouchi-no-Taro Koreyoshi</persName>, <persName>Murakami-no-Hangwan-
dai Yasukuni</persName>, and <persName>Tajiro-no-Kwanja Nobutsuna</persName>. The samurai
of this army were commanded by <persName>Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira</persName>, his son
<persName>Yatarō Tōhira</persName>, <persName>Miura-no suke Yoshizumi</persName>, his son <persName>Heiroku
<pb n="135" xml:id="p149-135"/>

Yoshimura</persName>, <persName>Hatakeyama-no-Shōji Jirō Shigetada</persName>, <persName>Hatakeyama-no-Nagano Saburō Shigekiyo</persName>, <persName>Sawara-no-Jūrō Yoshitsura</persName>,
<persName>Wada-no-Kotaro Yoshimori</persName>, <persName>Wada-no-Jiro Yoshimochi</persName>, <persName>Saburō
Munezane</persName>, <persName>Sasaki Shirō Takatsuna</persName>, <persName>Gorō Yoshikiyo</persName>, <persName>Kumagai-no-Jiro Naozane</persName>, his son <persName>Kojirō Naoie</persName>, <persName>Hirayama-no-Musha-

<persName>Beppu Kotarō Kiyoshige</persName>, <persName>Kaneko-no-Jūrō Ietada</persName>, <persName>Kaneko-no-Yoichi Chikanori</persName>, <persName>Gempachi Hirotsuna</persName>, <persName>Kataoka-no-Taro

These also started from the Capital at the same time as the
others, and taking the <placeName>Tamba</placeName> road, made a two days march in
one, taking up their position at a place called <placeName>Onohara</placeName> on the
eastern slope of <placeName>Mikusayama</placeName>, which is on the boundary of
<placeName>Tamba</placeName> and <placeName>Harima</placeName>.

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT MIKUSA.</head>
<p>The commanders on the <orgName>Heike</orgName> side were <persName>Komatsu-no-Shin-sammi Chūjō Sukemori</persName>, <persName>Komatsu-no-Shōshō Arimori</persName>,
<persName>Tango-no-Jiju Tadafusa</persName>, and <persName>Bitchu-no-kami Moromori</persName>, while
in command of the samurai were <persName>Iga-no-Heinaihyōye Kiyoie</persName>
and <persName>Emi-no-Jiro Masakata</persName> with about three thousand horsemen,
who took up their position on the western slope of <placeName>Mikusayama</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
That night at about eight o'clock <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> summoned to
him <persName>Doi-no-Jiro Sanehira</persName>, and said to him : "The <persName>Heike</persName> are
only about three ri distant from us: they are encamped on the
western slope of <placeName>Mikusayama</placeName> with a large force; shalle w
attack them by night or to-morrow? " The <persName>Tajiro-no-Kanja</persName>
stood forth and said: "We have a great advantage, for our
force numbers ten thousand men, whereas the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have only
<pb n="136" xml:id="p150-136"/>

about three thousand. If we wait to fight to-morrow their
numbers will most likely have increased, so let us attack them
at once to-night." "Excellently spoken, <persName>Tajiro Dono</persName>", said
<persName>Doi-no-Jiro</persName>, "that is what we all think; so let us make a night
attack on them." When this order was given to the soldiers,
however, they said each to his neighbour: "How dark it is:
what are we to do in this darkness?" "How about torches
then?" suggested <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. "So it must be "; replied
<persName>Doi</persName>, and they set fire to all the houses of <placeName>Onohara</placeName> and then to
all the trees and brushwood on the plain and on the mountain
slopes, so that it became as bright as day, and so they crossed
the hills for the distance of three ri without any hindrance.
</p>
<p>
Now this <persName>Tajiro-no-Kwanja</persName> was the youngest son of the
<persName>Chūnagon Tametsuna</persName>, the former Governor of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, and was
the issue of an amour that he had with the daughter of <persName>Kano-no-suke Shigemitsu</persName>, being brought up to the profession of arms
by his maternal grandfather, so that he was a skilful warrior as
well as of high lineage, being descended in the fifth generation
from <persName>Sukehito Shinnō</persName>, the third son of the <persName>Emperor Go-Sanjō</persName>.
</p>
<p>
As the <orgName>Heike</orgName> never dreamed that they would be attacked
that night, their leaders bade them sleep well till morning, for
as they would have to fight on the morrow, they must by no
means be drowsy, so, though the vanguard kept the usual
watch, those in the rear lay stretched out in careless slumber
with their heads pillowed on their helmets or quivers, or the
sleeves of their armour, entirely heedless of any danger. Then
suddenly, at about midnight, the ten thousand horsemen of the
<persName>Genji</persName> came sweeping down with ringing shouts on the western
slope of Mount <placeName>Mikusa</placeName>, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, taken completely by
surprise, rose and fled in wild confusion, leaving their weapons
behind them in their hurry and excitement, and scattering
everywhere in their fear of being trampled under the
horsehoofs of the enemy. Then the <orgName>Genji</orgName> rode right through their
ranks and pursued them and cut them down at their will, so
that at the first onset five hundred men were slain outright,
<pb n="137" xml:id="p151-137"/>

beside a large number who were wounded. The three
commanders, <persName>Shin-sammi Chūjō Sukemori</persName>, <persName>Komatsu Shōshō
Arimori</persName>, and <persName>Tango-no-Jiju Tadafusa</persName>, overcome with shame
at the rout of <placeName>Mikusa</placeName>, took ship from <placeName>Takasago</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName> and
crossed over to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>. <persName>Bitchū no-kami</persName> alone,
accompanied by <persName>Heinaihyōye</persName> and <persName>Emi-no-Jirō</persName>, somehow
contrived to make his way back again to <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9" xml:id="v9_ch9">
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>THE OLD HORSE.</head>
<p>Forthwith the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> dispatched <persName>Aki-no-Uma-no-suke Yoshiyuki</persName> with this message to all the chiefs of his
house. "We hear that <persName>Kurō Yoshitsune</persName> has attacked and
broken through our outpost at <placeName>Mikusayama</placeName> so that the hillside
on our flank is threatened: can you come to our assistance? "
But they all declined. Then the <persName>Daijin</persName> called once more on
<persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName>, saying: "Many times before have
you aided us; may we reply on your help once more?" "War"
replied <persName>Noritsune</persName>; "is just like fishing or any other sport;
he who always chooses the comfortable positions and refuses
the unfavourable ones will never win a victory. As for me,
have no fear, for I am ever ready to hasten where the greatest
danger threatens. Trust me to deal with the forces of <persName>Yoshi-
tsune</persName>." When this was reported to <persName>Munemori</persName>, he was
exceedingly glad, and at once put an army of ten thousand men, led
by <persName>Etchu Zenji Moritoshi</persName>, at the disposal of <persName>Noritsune</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Noritsune</persName>, taking with him his elder brother <persName>Echizen-no-sammi Michimori</persName>, set out for the hills. And these were the
hills that lay at the foot of the pass called <placeName>Hiyodori-goe</placeName>, behind
<placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>. <persName>Michimori</persName>, however, called his wife to the camp
of <persName>Noritsune</persName> in order that he might take a tender farewell of
her before the expedition, and when this came to the ears of
<persName>Noto-no-kami</persName> he was greatly enraged and rebuked him: "The
position we are to hold in one of great peril", said he, "and
<pb n="138" xml:id="p152-138"/>

matters are now most critical, for if the enemy should succeed in
descending on us over these hills, disaster stares us in the face.
To take a bow and not lay an arrow on the string is bad
enough, but to lay an arrow on the string and not to draw it is
worse still; so what is the use of wasting time in this soft
talk ?" Then <persName>Michimori</persName>, feeling the truth of his words,
dismissed his wife and put on his armour,
</p>
<p>
About dusk on the fifth day the <orgName>Genji</orgName> started from
<placeName>Koyano</placeName> and pressed on to attack the wood at <placeName>Ikuta</placeName>, and as
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> looked out over <placeName>Suzume-no-matsubara</placeName>, <placeName>Mikage-no-
matsu</placeName> and <placeName>Koyano</placeName>, they could see them pitching their camps
everywhere, while the glow of their thousand watch-fires
reddened the sky like the moon rising over the mountains.
The fires that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> kindled also showed up the dark
outline of the wood of <placeName>Ikuta</placeName>, and twinkled as they flared up
like stars in the brightening sky; reminding them too of the
glimmering fire-flies on the river bank, so often the subject of
their verse in the happy days gone by. So, as they beheld
the <orgName>Genji</orgName> thus deliberately pitching their camps here and there,
and feeding and resting their horses, they watched and wondered
when they would be attacked, their hearts filled with disquiet.
</p>
<p>
At dawn on the sixth day <persName>Kurō Onzōshi Yoshitsune</persName>,
dividing his ten thousand men into two companies, ordered
<persName>Doi-no-Jiro Sane hira</persName> to make an attack on the western outlet
of <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> with seven thousand, while he himself with the
remaining three thousand horsemen went round by the <placeName>Tango</placeName>
road to descend the pass of <placeName>Hiyodori-goe</placeName> to take them in the
rear. At this his men began to murmur to each other:
"Everyone knows the dangers of that place; if we must die, it
were better to die facing the foe than to fall over a cliff and be
killed. Does anyone know the way among these mountains ? '
"I know these mountains very well"; exclaimed <persName>Hirayama-no-Mushadokoro</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, in answer to these mutterings.
"But you were brought up in the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, and this
is the first time you have seen the mountains of the West",
<pb n="139" xml:id="p153-139"/>

objected <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "so how can you guide us?"
"That
may be even as your Excellency says ", replied <persName>Hirayama</persName>,
"but just as a poet knows the cherry-blossoms of <placeName>Yoshino</placeName> and
<placeName>Hatsuse</placeName> without seeing them, so does a proper warrior know
the way to the rear of an enemy's castle!" After this most
audacious speech, a young samurai of eighteen years old
named <persName>Beppu-no-Kotarō Kiyoshige</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> spoke up and
said:
"I have often been told by my father <persName>Yoshishige Hōshi</persName>,
that whether you are hunting on the mountains or fighting an
enemy, if you lose your way you must take an old horse, tie
the reins and throw them on his neck, and then drive him on
in front, and he will always find a path." "Well spoken",
said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "they say an old horse will find the road
even when it is buried in snow!" So they took an old grey
horse, trapped him with a silver-plated saddle and a
wellpolished bit, and tying the reins and throwing them on his
neck, drove him on in front of them, and so plunged into the
unknown mountains.

As it was the beginning of the second month, the snow
had melted here and there on the peaks and at times they
thought they saw flowers, while at times they heard the notes.
of the <term>Uguisu</term> of the valleys, and were hidden from sight in the
mist. As they ascended, the snow-clad peaks towered white
and glistening on either side of them, and as they descended
again into the valleys, the cliffs rose green on either hand.
The pines hung down under their load of snow, and scarcely
could they trace the narrow and mossy path. When a sudden
gust blew down a cloud of snow-flakes, they almost took them
for the falling plum-blossom. Whipping up their steeds to
their best pace they rode on some distance, until the falling
dusk compelled them to bivouac for the night in the depth of
the mountains.
</p>
<p>
As they were thus halted, <persName>Musashi-bō Benkei</persName> suddenly
appeared with an old man he had intercepted. In answer to
the questions of <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> he declared that he was a hunter
<pb n="140" xml:id="p154-140"/>

who lived in these mountains, and that he knew all that country
very well.
"Then ", said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "what do you think of
my plan of riding down into <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, the stronghold of the
<persName>Heike</persName>?' "Ah", replied the old man, "that can hardly be
done. The valley is a hundred yards deep, and of that about
half is steep cliff where no one can go. Besides, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> will
have dug pitfalls and spread caltrops inside the stronghold to
make it impossible for your horses." "Indeed? returned
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "but is it possible for a stag to pass there?"
“That stags pass there is certain", replied the hunter, “for
in the warm days of spring they come from <placeName>Harima</placeName> to seek the
thick pasture of <placeName>Tamba</placeName>, and when the winter grows cold they
go back towards <placeName>Inamino</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName> where the snow lies
lighter." "Forsooth!" ejaculated <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "then a horse
can do it, for where a stag may pass, there a horse can go also.
Will you then be our guide?" "I am an old man now; how
can I go so far?" replied the hunter. 'But you have a son?"
"I have." And <persName>Kumaō Maru</persName>, a youth of eighteen soon
appeared before the <orgName>Genji</orgName> leader. Then <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> performed
the ceremony of <term>Gempuku</term> for the young man, giving him the
name of <persName>Washio Saburo Yoshihisa</persName>, the name of his father
being <persName>Washio Shōji Takehisa</persName>, and he accompanied them, going
on in front to guide them down into <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>. And after
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been overthrown and the <orgName>Genji</orgName> obtained the
supremacy, and his lord <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> fell into disfavour with his
brother and fled to <placeName>Mutsu</placeName> and fell there, <persName>Washio Saburo
Yoshihisa</persName> was one of those who followed him to the death.

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>THE FIRST AND SECOND ASSAULTS.</head>
<p>Until midnight of the sixth day <persName>Kumagai</persName> and <persName>Hirayama</persName>
had ridden with the party of <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, when <persName>Kumagai</persName> called
his son <persName>Kojirō</persName> and said: "This party of ours is to attack on
difficult ground, so there will be little chance of being the

first in the onset.
Let us join the army of <persName>Doi</persName> and see if we
can be first in the assault on <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>.
"That is a good
plan", replied <persName>Kojirō</persName>, “and I think there are others of the
same opinion, so let us make haste." "That is true " answered
<persName>Naozane</persName>, "there is <persName>Hirayama</persName>; he does not care to be one of
the crowd; keep your eye on him"; he added to one of his
men. As he had expected <persName>Hirayama</persName> soon showed signs of
leaving the camp and was heard to mutter to himself:
"I must
get away unseen; it won't do for me to appear to run away."
"This beast is a long time over its feed," exclaimed his groom,
as he gave it a crack with the whip. "Let it alone"; said
<persName>Hirayama</persName>, "for this night may be its last." <persName>Kumagai's</persName>
retainer, hearing all this, hastened to tell it to his master, and
he too left the camp with all speed. <persName>Kumagai</persName> was clad in a
hitatare of dyed cloth and armour laced with red leather, with
a red Horo, or arrow guard, on his back, and bestrode a
splendid horse called <persName>Gondakurige</persName>. His son <persName>Kojirō Naoie</persName>
wore a hitatare ornamented with a design of water-plantains.
and armour laced with blue and white leather, and rode a
cream coloured horse called <persName>Seiro</persName>. His standard-bearer wore
a hitatare of light green with yellow designs, and armour laced
with yellow and green leather; he bestrode a grey horse with
dark yellow spots. Thus the three retraced their steps, and
leaving the valley they were to descend to the left, they turned.
off to the right and rode along an old path, that had long been
untrodden, called <placeName>Tai-no-hata</placeName>, which brought them out hard
by the beach at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira</persName> had withdrawn to a place called
<placeName>Shioya</placeName> near <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> to spend the night with his forces, and
<persName>Kumagai</persName>, making a circuit round them, passed them by in the
darkness and approached the western entrance of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
stronghold. It was yet dark and there was no sound from
within the place. "This is a hard place to attack", said
<persName>Kumagai</persName> to his son, "and you may be sure that there will be
many who will strive to be first in the assault. Doubtless.
<pb n="142" xml:id="p156-142"/>

.some are already here waiting for the dawn, so we must not
suppose we are alone. I will challenge them with our name
and titles" and riding close up to the enemy's breastwork, he
shouted out with a loud voice: "<persName>Kumagai-no-Jirō Naozane</persName> of
the province of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, and his son <persName>Kojirō Naoie</persName>! First in
the assault on <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>! In answer to this the enemy
were heard to shout within the barricade: "Pay no heed, let
them tire out their horses and shoot away their arrows!"
And so none came forth from the stronghold to meet them.
</p>
<p>
After a while, hearing two horsemen come up behind them,
<persName>Kumagai</persName> hailed them, enquiring who they were. • <persName>Hirayama
Sueshige</persName>"; was the reply; "and who is it that calls ? "
"<persName>Naozane</persName>.” "Ah. <persName>Kumagai Dono</persName>, how long have you been
here?" "All night." "I also should have been here
before", said <persName>Hirayama</persName>, "but I was tricked by that fellow
<persName>Narita Gorō</persName>, for he got me to take him with me on the plea
that he had sworn to die with me, but on the way he persuaded
me not to ride on so fast, saying that if we left all our own
men a long way behind, and rode into the enemy alone to be
killed, nothing much would be gained thereby, and I listened
to his words and halted my horse on a little knoll from which
I could see our men coming up, thinking that <persName>Narita</persName> was
following me, but instead of that he rode on past me. When
I saw I had been tricked, I whipped up my horse and rode on
after him, and as he had only gone on about twenty yards, and
his mount was rather tired, I soon caught him up, and after
reproaching him for thus deceiving me, I rode on and left him
behind so that he is not yet in sight.'
</p>
<p>
The dawn was now growing grey, and <persName>Kumagai</persName> and
<persName>Hirayama</persName> with their retainers were still alone before the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
stronghold, and though <persName>Kumagai</persName> had already challenged the
enemy once, as this was before <persName>Hirayama</persName> had come up, he
bethought him to do so once more, so rising again in his
stirrups he repeated his name and titles. At this there was a
stir within the barricade, and thinking to take <persName>Kumagai</persName> and
<pb n="143" xml:id="p157-143"/>

his son alive, <persName>Etchu-no-Jirōhyōye Moritsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorōhyōye Tadamitsu</persName>, <persName>Akushichihyōye Kagekiyo</persName> and <persName>Gotōnai
Sadatsune</persName> with twenty retainers issued forth from the entrance
to give them battle. Then <persName>Hirayama</persName> also lifted up his voice
and declared himself: "<persName>Hirayama-no Mushadokoro Sueshige</persName>
of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, who has won great renown by his prowess in the
fighting of Hogen and Heiji!" He was attired in a hitatare
of patterned brocade and armour laced with scarlet, having at
his back a Horo with two wide stripes, and rode a splendid
horse that was dappled about the eyes. His standard-bearer
was in armour laced with black leather, and rode a
creamcoloured horse: his helmet was thrown back so as to expose
his face. Thus the fight began, and <persName>Kumagai</persName> and <persName>Hirayama</persName>
both bore themselves most valiantly, one charging forward
when the other gave back, and neither yielding to the other in
strength and boldness, hewing at the foe with loud shouts while
the sparks flew from their weapons, till at last the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
retainers, wounded and battered by the fierce onslaughts of the
two champions, retreated within their barricade and shut the
enemy outside.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Kumagai's</persName> horse had been shot in the belly, so he
dismounted and stood leaning on his bow, while his son <persName>Naoie</persName>,
who was only eighteen years old, and had been ever foremost
in the fighting, had received an arrow in the left forearm, and
alighting also, stood beside him. "How is that, <persName>Kojirō</persName>, are
you wounded?" he asked.
Ah, you
should shift your
armour about well so that the arrows don't go through it.
Keep your neck-guard well sloped, and don't get shot in the
face." <persName>Naozane</persName> then pulled out the arrows that were sticking
in his own mail, and turned and glared fiercely at the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
behind the wall. "When <persName>Naozane</persName> left <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> last winter ",
he shouted, "he pledged his life to his lord <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, and
swore that his bones should whiten on the sands of <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>.
So much for <persName>Etchū-no-Jirōhyōye</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorōhyōye</persName>, and
<persName>Akushichihyōye</persName>, the famous victors of <placeName>Muroyama</placeName> and
<pb n="144" xml:id="p158-144"/>

<placeName>Mizushima</placeName>! Is not <persName>Noto Dono</persName> within there? Here we stand,
father and son! Come forth and meet us, any who dare!'
At this defiance <persName>Etchu-no-Jiröhyöye Moritsugu</persName> glared at the
pair and advanced towards them. He was clad in a hitatare
of purple and a suit of armour with red lacing, and wore a
helmet adorned with lofty horns. His sword was mounted in
gold, and his saddle inlaid with the same metal, while on his
back he carried a quiver of arrows with black and white
feathers. His black lacquered bow was bound with rattan, and
he rode a horse of dappled gray. Side by side, without
yielding a pace, the two <persName>Kumagai</persName> met him, and drawing their
blades pressed on him without shifting either to the right or
left. At this bold front <persName>Etchu Jiro</persName> felt his courage fail him,
and straightway retreated whence he had come. What ",
shouted <persName>Naozane</persName>, "does <persName>Etchū Jirōhyōye</persName> refuse our challenge?
In what do we fail him? On to the attack!"
But <persName>Jirōhyōye</persName>
refused to be enticed and continued his progress toward the
stronghold. "How cowardly is the conduct of you fellows",
cried <persName>Akushichihyōye</persName> when he perceived this retreat, "there
is none who dares to close with them or come to grips!"
And he was riding out to attack them himself, when <persName>Jirōhyōye</persName>
seized the sleeve of his armour and held him back saying :
"Your life is too precious to risk it here; forbear! forbear!"
And being thus restrained he did not venture.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Kumagai</persName>, mounting a fresh horse, again rode to the
assault, and <persName>Hirayama</persName>, who had rested his charger while
<persName>Kumagai</persName> was fighting, now came on to his support. Seeing
this the <orgName>Heike</orgName> drew their bows with might and main and rained
their arrows on the little band, but so crowded were they and
so small was their mark that none of their shafts took effect,
and when they tried to charge them, as the <orgName>Heike</orgName> steeds were
badly fed and over-ridden, and had been long cooped up on
shipboard, they would by no means obey the hand of their
masters; whereas the horses of <persName>Kumagai</persName> and <persName>Hirayama</persName> were
stout and well fed animals that in the shock of battle would
<pb n="145" xml:id="p159-145"/>

overthrow and trample down both horse and rider, so that
none of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were found willing to face them. Just then
it happened that <persName>Hirayama's</persName> standard-bearer, for whom he
would have given his life, was slain, and his master, driven to
desperation at his loss, made a rush into the stronghold and
cut off the head of the enemy who had killed him, emerging
again safely once more. <persName>Kumagai</persName> had taken much spoil and
had been the first to arrive before the entrance, but as the gate
was shut he was unable to enter, whereas <persName>Hirayama</persName>, who had
come up later, charged within the gate when it was opened, so
that it was difficult to decide which had the honour of being
the foremost.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11" xml:id="v9_ch11">
<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>THE SECOND ASSAULT.</head>
<p>Meanwhile <persName>Narita Gorō</persName> had come up also, and the seven
thousand men of <persName>Doi no-Jirō Sanehira</persName>, shouting their warcries,
came on to the attack under the banners or their different
leaders. Now among the fifty thousand horsemen of the main
force of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, who were besetting the other entrance at
<placeName>Ikuta</placeName>, were two brothers, <persName>Kawara Tarō</persName> and <persName>Kawara Jirō</persName>, of
<placeName>Musashi</placeName>; and the elder of these, <persName>Kawara Tarō</persName>, called to the
younger and said to him: "Though a <persName>Daimyō</persName> may win
renown without fighting himself, through the deeds of his
retainers, that reputation is not one that I covet, for I cannot
bear to take no part in the battle. To wait here with the
enemy before our eyes without drawing bow on him makes the
courage fail, so I have determined to get within the defenses
and let fly at them there. As I am not likely to come forth
alive, do you stay here to bear witness to my posterity.'
Bursting into tears the younger brother replied: "For two
brothers like ourselves how inglorious is it that one should die
thus and the other still survive? Let us not then die separately
but fall together in one place": and calling their retainers and
<pb n="146" xml:id="p160-146"/>

bidding them bear the tidings of their end to their wives and
children, they dismounted and put on straw sandals, and then,
carrying their bows only, they climbed over the barricade
under cover of darkness. Standing within the stronghold,
though the colour of their armour could not be distinguished
in the star-light, they shouted loudly: "<persName>Kawara Tarō Kisaichi
Takanao</persName>, and his brother <persName>Jirō Masanao</persName>, first in the attack on
<placeName>Ikuta-no-mori</placeName>! Hearing this the <orgName>Heike</orgName> within were
astonished and said to one another": How terrible are these
warriors of the East! See how these two brothers have
ventured alone into the midst of our great host!
"Tis a pity
to touch them." And for a while none lifted a hand against
them. But the two brothers were both exceedingly skilful
archers, and now they drew their bows and let fly their shafts
with the greatest rapidity, so that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> cried out to spare
them no longer but to cut them down. Now among the
Western samurai there were two brothers also who were
archers of renown, men of <placeName>Bitchu</placeName>, <persName>Manabe-no-Shirō</persName> and
<persName>Manabe-no-Goro</persName> by name, and the elder brother <persName>Shirō</persName> was
with the force at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, while <persName>Gorō</persName> the younger was
posted at <placeName>Ikuta</placeName>. Coming forward he drew his bow to the
arrowhead, and taking careful aim, let fly his shaft at <persName>Kawara-no-Tarō</persName>, who staggered forward pierced through the
breastplate. As he tried to support his failing strength on his bow,
his brother <persName>Jirō</persName> ran up, and taking him on his back, made to
climb the barricade once more, when <persName>Manabe</persName>, fitting a second
arrow to the string, shot him under the skirts of his armour, so
that both brothers fell dead together. His retainers then ran
up and cut off both their heads, which they brought and
showed to the commander <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori</persName>." Ah,
the pity of it, "said he, that two such valiant men-at-arms
should die. Would that their lives could have been spared,
for they were each worth a thousand men."
</p>
<p>
Then the retainers of <persName>Kawara</persName> hasted and told <persName>Kajiwara
Heizō</persName> that the two brothers had scaled the walls of the strong-
<pb n="147" xml:id="p161-147"/>

hold and had died within it. "That the two brothers <persName>Kawara</persName>
have fallen is indeed a dire loss for the <persName>Kisaichi</persName> clan ", said
<persName>Kajiwara</persName>, "but the time is now ripe for the attack, so let us
advance," So the five hundred men under <persName>Kajiwara</persName> swept
forward to the defences to fight their way into the stronghold.
Then <persName>Kajiwara Heizō</persName>, seeing that his second son <persName>Heiji</persName> had
already far outstripped his men, sent a retainer after him
saying: "Those who ride on so that their men cannot follow
will be held culpable. It is the order of the Commander.”
When this was communicated to <persName>Heiji</persName> he drew in his horse a
space while he made the following verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"If the warrior's bow be once well bent for the arrow,</l>
<l>Who is the foolish wight who will unbend it again?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
After which he rode on again, shouting loudly. "See that
<persName>Heiji</persName> is not killed! After him, all of you!" cried his father, as,
with his eldest son <persName>Genda</persName> and his third son <persName>Saburō</persName>, he led his
force in a charge into the <orgName>Heike</orgName> ranks, where, cutting and
slashing in all directions they bewed a way for themselves,
and then turned and as quickly withdrew. His son <persName>Genda</persName>,
however, did not emerge with the rest, and in answer to his
father's question the retainers declared that they had not seen
him for some time, and imagined him to have penetrated too
deeply, so that he had been surrounded and slain. "Ah!"
exclaimed <persName>Heizō</persName>, bursting into tears, "it was to save my son
that I made this charge, and now to think that <persName>Genda</persName> is dead
and I, his father, am still alive! Back again! At them once
more!" And he rose in his stirrups and shouted loudly:
"Ho! I am <persName>Ksjiwara Heizō Kagetoki</persName>, descended in the fifth
generation from <persName>Gongorō Kagemasa</persName> of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, renowned
warrior of the East Country, a match for any thousand men!
At the age of sixteen I rode in the van of the army of
<persName>Hachimantarō Yoshiie</persName> at the siege of the fortress of <placeName>Sembuku
Kanazawa</placeName> in <placeName>Dewa</placeName>, and receiving an arrow in my left eye
through the helmet, I plucked it forth and with it shot down
the marksman who sent it, thereby gaining honours and leaving
<pb n="148" xml:id="p162-148"/>

a name to posterity! Come on now, all you who think
yourselves somebody, and we will see!" At this proud defiance
the defenders shouted: "This is one of the greatest warriors
of the East! Strike him down! Don't let him escape!" and
they rushed upon him from all sides to cut him down. <persName>Heizō</persName>,
caring nothing for his life, dashed through their midst looking
everywhere for signs of his son <persName>Genda</persName>, and soon found him, as
he expected, dismounted and fighting on foot, for his horse had
been shot under him, with his helmet struck off from his head
and his long hair flying in the wind, his back against a rock
twenty feet high, and two of his retainers on his left and right,
fighting desperately with five soldiers of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. As <persName>Genda</persName>
was thus fighting, as he thought, his last fight, his father,
overjoyed at finding him still alive, sprang from his horse and
shouted: "Ho! <persName>Genda</persName>! <persName>Kagetoki</persName> is here! Let us die
together and not show our backs to the foe!
Then, after
they had killed three of the enemy and wounded the other two,
<persName>Heizō</persName> exciaimed: "Warriors advance or retreat according to
circumstances. Come <persName>Genda</persName>!" And they made good their
escape. Thus was the second assault made by <persName>Kajiwara</persName>.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12" xml:id="v9_ch12">
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>THE DESCENT OF THE HILL.</head>
<p>Thereafter the battle became general and the various clans
of the <orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName> surged over each other in mixed and
furious combat. The men of the <persName>Miura</persName>, <persName>Kamakura</persName>, <persName>Chichibu</persName>,
<persName>Ashikaga</persName>, <persName>Noiyo</persName>, <persName>Yokoyama</persName>, <persName>Inomata</persName>, <persName>Kodama</persName>, <persName>Nishi</persName>, <persName>Tsu-
zuki</persName> and <persName>Kisaichi</persName> clans charged against each other with a roar
like thunder, while the hills re-echoed to the sound of their
war-cries, and the shafts they shot at each other fell like rain,
Some were wounded slightly and fought on, some grappled and
stabbed each other to death, while others bore down their
adversaries and cut off their heads: everywhere the fight rolled
<pb n="149" xml:id="p163-149"/>

forward and backward, so that none could tell who were
victors or vanquished.
</p>
<p>
Thus it did not appear that the main body of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
had been successful in their attack, when at dawn on the
seventh day <persName>Kurō Onzōshi Yoshitsune</persName> with his force of three
thousand horsemen, having climbed to the top of the <placeName>Hiyodori-
goe</placeName>, was resting his horses before the descent. Just then,
startled by the movements of his men, two stags and a doe
rushed out and fled over the cliff straight into the camp of the
<persName>Heike</persName>. "That is strange ", exclaimed the <orgName>Heike</orgName> men-at-arms,
'for the deer of this part ought to be frightened at our noise
and run away to the mountains. Aha! it must be the enemy
who is preparing to drop on us from above!" And they
began to run about in confusion, when forth strode <persName>Takechi-no-Mushadokoro</persName> of the province of <placeName>Iyo</placeName>, and drawing his bow
transfixed the two stags, though letting the doe escape.
"Thus", he cried, "will we deal with any who try that road,
and none are likely to pass it alive!" "What useless shooting
of stags is this?" said <persName>Etchū Zenji Moritoshi</persName> when he saw it;
one of those arrows might have stopped ten of the enemy, so
why waste them in that fashion?"
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, looking down on the <orgName>Heike</orgName> position
from the top of the cliff, ordered some horses to be driven
down the declivity, and of these, though some missed their
footing half-way, and breaking their legs, fell to the
bottom and were killed, three saddled horses scrambled
down safely and stood, trembling in every limb, before the
residence of <persName>Etchu Zenji</persName>. "If they have riders to guide
them", said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "the horses will get down without
damage, so let us descend, and I will show you the way";
and he rode over the cliff at the head of his thirty retainers,
seeing which the whole force of three thousand followed on
after him. For more than a hundred yards the slope was
sandy with small pebbles, so that they slid straight down it and
landed on a level place, from which they could survey the rest
<pb n="150" xml:id="p164-150"/>

of the descent. From thence downwards it was all great
mossy boulders, but steep as a well, and some fifty yards to
the bottom. It seemed impossible to go on any further,
neither could they now retrace their steps, and the soldiers
were recoiling in horror, thinking that their end had come,
when <persName>Miura-no-Sahara Jūrō Yoshitsura</persName> sprang forward and
shouted: "In my part we ride down places like this any day
to catch a bird; the <persName>Miura</persName> would make a race-course of this";
and down he went, followed by all the rest. So steep was the
descent that the stirrups of the hinder man struck against the
helmet or armour of the one in front of him, and so dangerous
did it look that they averted their eyes as they went down.
"Ei! Ei!" they ejaculated under their breath as they steadied
their horses, and their daring seemed rather that of demons
than of men.
So they reached the bottom, and as soon as
they found themselves safely down they burst forth with a
mighty shout, which echoed-along the cliffs so that it sounded
rather like the battle-cry of ten thousand men than of three.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Murakami-no-Hangwan-dai Yasukuni</persName> seized a torch
and fired the houses and huts of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> so that they went
up in smoke in a few moments, and when their men saw the
clouds of black smoke rising they at once made a rush toward
the sea, if haply they might find a way of escape. There was
no lack of ships drawn up by the beach, but in their panic four
or five hundred men in full armour and even a thousand all
crowded into one ship, so that when they had rowed out not
more than fifty or sixty yards from the shore, three large ships.
turned over and sank before their eyes. Moreover those in the
ships would only take on board those warriors who were of
high rank, and thrust away the common soldiers, slashing at
them with their swords and halberds, but even though they
saw this, rather than stay and be cut down by the enemy, they
clung to the ships and strove to drag themselves on board, so
that their hands and arms were cut off and they fell back into
the sea, which quickly reddened with their blood. Thus, both

<p><pb n="151" xml:id="p165-151"/>

on the main front and on the sea-shore did the young warriors
of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> and <placeName>Sagami</placeName> strain every nerve in the fight, caring
nothing for their lives as they rushed desperately to the attack.
What must have been the feelings of <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName>,
who in all his many battles had never been vanquished until
now?
Mounting his charger <persName>Usuzumi</persName>, he galloped away
toward the West, and taking ship from <placeName>Takasago</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName>,
crossed over to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>.

<head>THE DEATH OF MORITOSHI.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Shin-Chūnagen Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> was in command
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> at <placeName>Ikuta-no-mori</placeName>, and as all his mind was bent on
the eastward, a messenger from the <persName>Kodama</persName> clan came riding
up to him.
"Your lordship was Govenor of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> last
year," said he, "and because of that connexion the <persName>Kodama</persName>.
clan has sent me to warn you. Look to your rear!" Then
the retainers of <persName>Tomomori</persName> turned and saw the clouds of black
smoke ascending behind them, and crying out that all was lost
and the western army had given way, they were stricken with
panic and broke and fled in wild confusion.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Etchu Zenji Moritoshi</persName> was the leader of the samurai on
the cliff side, and when he saw all the others take to flight,
disdaining to follow them, he reined in his charger to await the
foe, when <persName>Inomata-no-Koheiroku Noritsuna</persName>, rejoicing to meet
so redoutable an antagonist, urged on his horse and bore down
upon him. Rushing upon each other, they grappled fiercely
so that both fell from their horses, and though <persName>Inomata</persName> was
famous for his great strength in all the eight provinces of the
East, and was said to have torn off the upper branches of a
stag-horn with ease, <persName>Etchū Zenji</persName> had the strength of twenty or
thirty ordinary men, and indeed so powerful were his limbs
that he could haul up or down a heavy ship that it took sixty
or seventy men to move, and so he gripped his adversary and
<pb n="152" xml:id="p166-152"/>

pinned him down so that he could not rise. Thus prostrate
beneath his foe, try how he would to shift him or draw his
sword, he could not so much as stir a finger to the hilt, and
even when he strove to speak, so great was the pressure
that no
word would come forth. Spite of all this, however, he was
yet undaunted, and after a short breathing space he managed to
ejaculate: "When a samurai takes the head of an enemy it is
the custom that he first enquire his name and also declare his
own. It is great merit to take a head, but of what value is one
without a name?" Thinking this most reasonable, <persName>Moritoshi</persName>
then declared himself: "I am <persName>Etchū Zenji Moritoshi</persName>,
formerly a Courtier of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house, but now only worthy
to be an ordinary samurai. I pray you tell me your name
also." "I am <persName>Inomata-no-Koheiroku Noritsuna</persName> ", replied the
other faintly," and if you will spare my life I will obtain yours
as a reward for my share in the victory, and so you may
escape the doom of your house." "What disgraceful speech
is this?" cried <persName>Moritoshi</persName> in great wrath. "Unworthy though
I may be, I am yet a <persName>Taira</persName>, and never will I stoop to ask or
grant favours to any of <persName>Genji</persName> blood!" And he was just about.
to cut off his head when <persName>Inomata</persName> pleaded again:
"Who is
so unchivalrous as to cut off the head of a surrendered foe?"
Whereupon <persName>Moritoshi</persName> relented and spared his life.
</p>
<p>
Now the place where they had fought was solid ground in
front, but behind them lay deep and swampy ricefields, and on
a narrow path between these the two sat down to rest and
recover their breath, when a single horseman rode up, clad in
scarlet armour and mounted on a cream-coloured horse with
saddle decorated with gold. <persName>Moritoshi</persName> glared at him
suspiciously. "That is <persName>Hitomi Shirō</persName>, a friend of <persName>Inomata</persName> ;
he has come to see what has happened, but I will deal with
him too"; and he sprang up and prepared to grapple with him
as soon as he came near enough. Now <persName>Etchū Zenji</persName> kept an
eye on both his foes at first, but as the other drew nearer, his
attention became more fixed on him, which <persName>Inomata</persName> perceiving,
<pb n="153" xml:id="p167-153"/>

he suddenly sprang up from the ground and dealt <persName>Moritoshi</persName> a
heavy blow on the breast-plate with his closed fist. Losing his
balance at this unexpected attack, <persName>Moritoshi</persName> fell over backwards,
when <persName>Inomata</persName> immediately leapt upon him, snatched his dagger
from his side, and pulling up the skirt of his armour, stabbed
him so deeply thrice that the hilt and fist went in after the
blade. Having thus dispatched him he cut off his head, and as
<persName>Hitomi Shirō</persName> had come up by then, and at such times disputes
about heads were apt to arise, he stuck it on the point of his
sword and held it aloft, at the same time shouting loudly:
"The head of <persName>Etchu Zenji Moritoshi</persName>, the famous
demonwarrior of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, slain by <persName>Inomata-no-Koheiroku Noritsuna</persName>
of the province of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>!" And on the roll of those who
did valiantly that day the name of <persName>Inomata</persName> stood first.

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>THE DEATH OF TADANORI.</head>
<p><persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName> the Commander of the western
army, clad in a dark-blue hitatare and a suit of armour with
black silk lacing, and mounted on a great black horse with a
saddle enriched with lacquer of powdered gold, was calmly
withdrawing with his following of a hundred horsemen, when
<persName>Okabe-on-Rokuyata Tadazumi</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> espied him and
pursued at full gallop, eager to bring down so noble a prize.
"This must be some great leader! he cried. "Shameful! to
turn your back to the foe!" <persName>Tadanori</persName> turned in the saddle;
"We are friends! We are friends!" he replied, as he
continued on his way. As he had turned, however, <persName>Tadazumi</persName>
had caught a glimpse of his face and noticed that his teeth
were blackened. "There are none of our side who have
blackened teeth", he said, "this must be one of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
Courtiers." And overtaking him, he ranged up to him to
grapple. When his hundred followers saw this, since they
were hired retainers drawn from various provinces, they
<pb n="154" xml:id="p168-154"/>

scattered and fled in all directions, leaving their leader to his
fate. But <persName>Satsuma-no-kami</persName>, who had been brought up at
<placeName>Kumano</placeName>, was famous for his strength, and was extremely
active and agile besides, so clutching <persName>Tadazumi</persName> he pulled him
from his horse, dealing him two stabs with his dirk while he
was yet in the saddle, and following them with another as he
was falling. The first two blows fell on his armour and failed
to pierce it, while the third wounded him in the face but was
not mortal, and as <persName>Tadanori</persName> sprang down upon him to cut off
his head, <persName>Tadazumi's</persName> page, who had been riding behind him,
slipped from his horse and with a blow of his sword cut off
<persName>Tadanori's</persName> arm above the elbow, <persName>Satsuma-no-kami</persName>, seeing that
all was over and wishing to have a short space to say the
death-prayer, flung <persName>Tadazumi</persName> away from him so that he fell
about a bow's length away. Then turning toward the
west he repeated: "Kōmyō Henjō Jippō Sekai, Nembutsu
Shujō Sesshu Fusha; O <persName>Amida Nyorai</persName>, who sheddest the light
of Thy Presence through the ten quarters of the world, gather
into Thy Radiant Heaven all who call upon Thy Name!"
And just as his prayer was finished, <persName>Tadazumi</persName> from behind
swept off his head.
</p>
<p>
Not doubting that he had taken the head of a noble foe,
but quite unaware who he might be, he was searching his
armour when he came across a piece of paper fastened to his
quiver, on which was written a verse with this title; "The
Traveller's Host, a Flower."
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Seeking where I may lodge on my weary way, in the evening</l>
<l>Under a tree I lie; now is my host but a flower."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Wherefore he knew that it conld be none but
<persName>Satsuma-on-kami</persName>.
Then he lifted up the
head on his sword's point and
shouted with a loud voice:
"<persName>Satsuma-no-kami Dono</persName>, the
demon-warrior of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>, slain by <persName>Okabe-no-Rokuyata
Tadazumi</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>!" And when they heard it, all, friends
and foes alike, moistened the sleeves of their armour with their

tears, exclaiming: "Alas! what a great captain has passed
away! Warrior and artist and poet; in all things he was
preeminent.”

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>SHIGEHIRA IS TAKEN ALIVE.</head>
<p><persName>Hon-sammi Chūjō Shigehira</persName> was second in command at
<placeName>Ikuta-no-mori</placeName>, and he was attired that day in a hitatare of
dark-blue cloth on which a pattern of rocks and seabirds was
embroidered in light yellow silk, and armour with purple
lacing deepening in its hue toward the skirts. On his head
was a helmet with tall golden horns, and his sword also was
mounted in gold. His arrows were feathered with black and
white falcon plumes, and in his hand he carried a '<term>Shigetō</term>' bow.
He was mounted on a renowned war-horse called <persName>Dōji-kage</persName>,
whose trappings were desplendent with ornaments of gold.
With him was his foster-brother <persName>Gotō Hyōye Ma anaga</persName> in a
hitatare of dyed brocade and a suit of armour with scarlet
lacing, and he too was mounted on a splendid cream-coloured
charger named <persName>Yome-nashi</persName> As they were riding along the
shore to take ship and escape, <persName>Shō-no-Shirō Takaie</persName> and
<persName>Kajiwara Genda Kagesue</persName>, thinking they looked a fine prize,
spurred on their horses and bore down upon them. Now
there were many ships ranged along the shore, but the enemy
pressed on them so hard from behind that there was no
opportunity to embark, so the two, crossing the <placeName>Minatogawa</placeName>
and the <placeName>Karumogawa</placeName>, and leaving <placeName>Hasu-no-ike</placeName> on the right
and <placeName>Koma-no-hayashi</placeName> on the left, rode hard through <placeName>Itayado</placeName>
and <placeName>Suma</placeName> and endeavoured to make their escape to the west.
As <persName>Sammi Chūjō</persName> was nounted on such a famous charger as
<persName>Doji-kage</persName> it seemed unlikely that any ordinary horse would
overhaul him, and the pursuers mounts were already
weakening, when <persName>Kajiwara</persName> drew his bow to the head sent an arrow
whizzing after them. Though a long venture the shaft flew
<pb n="156" xml:id="p170-156"/>

true to its mark, and buried itself deeply in the hind-leg of the
<persName>Chujō's</persName> steed, just above the root of the tail. Seeing its pace
slacken his foster-brother <persName>Morinaga</persName>, thinking that the <persName>Chūjō</persName>
might demand his mount, whipped it up and made good his
escape. "Ah!" exclaimed the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, "why do you desert
me thus ?
Have you forgotten all your promises?" But he
paid no heed, and tearing off the red badge from his armour,
thought of nothing but saving himself by flight. Then the
<persName>Chūjō</persName>, seeing that his horse could go no farther, plunged
headlong into the sea to die by drowning, but the water was so
shallow that there was no time, and as he started to cut himself
open, <persName>Shō-no-Shirō Takaie</persName> rode up, and springing from his
horse, called out to him: "Desist I pray you; allow me to
take you with me." And placing him on his own horse, he
bound him to the pommel of his saddle and escorted him back
to the <orgName>Genji</orgName> camp.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Chujo's</persName> foster-brother <persName>Morinaga</persName>, who had ridden
away and deserted him, fled to seek refuge with <persName>Onaka Hōkyō</persName>,
one of the priests of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, but after his death returned
again to the Capital with his widow, when she came up on
account of a lawsuit that she had. There he was recognised
by many of his associates who had know him in past times, and
they pointed the finger of scorn at him saying: "How
disgraceful! There is <persName>Gotō Hyōye Morinaga</persName>, who deserted the
<persName>Chūjō</persName> in his need and refused to aid him. He has come back
again with the widow of the <persName>Hōkyō</persName>." And <persName>Morinaga</persName>, when
he heard it was so ashamed that he hid his face with his fan.

<head>THE DEATH OF ATSUMORI.</head>
<p>Now when the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were routed at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, and their
<roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName> were fleeing to the shore to escape in
their ships, <persName>Kumagai Jiro Naozane</persName> came riding along a narrow
path on to the beach, with the intention of intercepting one of
<pb n="157" xml:id="p171-157"/>

their great captains. Just then his eye fell on a single
horseman who was attempting to reach one of the ships in the offing,
and had swum his horse out some twenty yards from the
water's edge. He was richly attired in a silk hitatare
embroidered with storks, and the lacing of his armour was
shaded green; his helmet was surmounted by lofty horns, and
the sword he wore was gay with gold. His twenty four
arrows had black and white feathers, and he carried a
blacklacquered bow bound with rattan. The horse he rode was
dappled grey, and its saddle glittered with gold mounting.
Not doubting that he was one of the chief captains, <persName>Kumagai</persName>
beckoned to him with his war-fan, crying out: "Shameful! to
show an enemy your back. Return! Return!" Then the
warrior turned his horse and rode him back to the beach,
where <persName>Kumagai</persName> at once engaged him in mortal combat.
Quickly hurling him to the ground, he sprang upon him and
tore off his helmet to cut off his head, when he beheld the face
of a youth of sixteen or seventeen, delicately powdered and
with blackened teeth, just about the age of his own son, and
with features of great beauty. "Who are you?" he enquired;
"Tell me your name, for I would spare your life."
“ Nay,
first say who you are"; replied the young men.
"I am
<persName>Kumagai Jirō Naozane</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, a person of no particular
importance.' "Then you have made a good capture"; said
the youth. "Take my head and show it to some of my side
and they will tell you who I am." "Though he is one of
their leaders", mused <persName>Kumagai</persName>, "if I slay him it will not turn
defeat into victory, and if I spare him, it will not turn victory
into defeat. When my son <persName>Kojirō</persName> was but slightly wounded
at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, did it not make my heart bleed? How pitiful
then to put this youth to death." And so he was about to set
him free, when, looking behind him, he saw <persName>Doi</persName> and <persName>Kajiwara</persName>
coming up with fifty horsemen. "Alas! look there", he
exclaimed, the tears running down his face ", though I would
spare your life, the whole country-side swarms with our men,
<pb n="158" xml:id="p172-158"/>

and you cannot escape them. If you must die, let it be by my
hand, and I will see that prayers are said for your re-birth in
bliss." "Indeed it must be so ", said the young warrior, “so
take off my head at once." Then <persName>Kumagai</persName>, weeping bitterly,
and so overcome by his compassion for the fair youth that his
eyes swam and his hand trembled so that he could scarcely
wield his blade, hardly knowing what he did, at last cut off his
head. "Alas!" he cried, "what life is so hard as that of a
soldier? Only because I was born of a warrior family must I
suffer this affliction! How lamentable it is to do such cruel
deeds!" And he pressed his face to the sleeve of his armour
and wept bitterly. Then, wrapping up the head, he was
stripping off the young man's armour, when he discovered a
flute in a brocade bag that he was carrying in his girdle.
'Ah", he exclaimed, "it was this youth and his friends who
were amusing themselves with music within the walls this
morning. Among all our men of the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName> I
doubt if there is any who has brought a flute with him. What
esthetes are these <persName>Courtiers</persName> of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>!" And when he
brought them and showed them to the Commander, all who
saw them were moved to tears; and he then discovered that
the youth was <persName>Taiyū Atsumori</persName>, the youngest son of <persName>Shūri-no-
taiyu Tsunemori</persName>, aged seventeen years. From this time the
mind of <persName>Kumagai</persName> was turned toward the religious life and he
eventually became a recluse.
</p>
<p>
The flute of <persName>Atsumori</persName> was one which his grandfather
<persName>Tadamori</persName>, who was a famous player, had received as a present
from the <persName>Emperor Toba</persName>, and had handed down to his father
<persName>Tsunemori</persName>, who had given it to <persName>Atsumori</persName> because of his skill on
the instrument. It was called '<persName>Saeda</persName>'. Concerning this story of
<persName>Kumagai</persName> we may quote the saying that "even in the most droll
and flippant farce there is the germ of a Buddhist Psalm."

<p><persName>Kurando-no-taiyū Narimori</persName>, the youngest son of <persName>Kado-

Tsunetoshi</persName> charged headlong into the midst of the foe, and
after fighting valiantly for a while, at last fell gloriously
together.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName>, who was in command
at <placeName>Ikuta-no-mori</placeName>, after all his men had either fled or been slain,
rode off toward the beach with his son <persName>Musashi-no-kami
Tomoakira</persName> and a faithful retainer named <persName>Kenmotsu Tarō
Yorikata</persName>, when ten horsemen of the <persName>Kodama</persName> clan, carrying a
fan as their standard, put their steeds to a gallop and gave
chase. <persName>Kenmotsu Tarō</persName>, a famous archer, turned and let fly
an arrow at the standard-bearer who rode in front, and pierced
him through neck and, backbone so that he fell dead from his
horse. Then the leader of the band bore down on <persName>Tomomori</persName>
to come to close quarters, but his son <persName>Tomoakira</persName>, anxious to
save his father, sprang in between them and grappled with the
enemy, throwing him to the ground and then springing down
on him and cutting off his head. No sooner had he done this,
however, than his opponent's page sprang down also, and
taking him at a disadvantage, succeeded in despatching him.
Then <persName>Kenmotsu Tarō</persName>, falling in his turn on the retainer who
had slain <persName>Musashi-no-kami</persName>, killed him also, after which, having
shot away all his arrows, he drew his sword to continue the
conflict, but, after, being severely wounded in the left knee by
an arrow, unable to stand up any longer, he was overcome and
killed.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori</persName>, taking advantage of the
confusion of the fighting, spurred on his horse and escaped,
<pb n="160" xml:id="p174-160"/>

and, plunging into the sea, after swimming his horse, which
was renowned for its long wind, more than a mile, he managed
to reach the ship of the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>. As the ship was
crowded with men, there was no room to bring the horse on
board, and so they drove it off back to the shore. Then <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName> took an arrow in his hand, saying:
"Let me shoot it so that it may not fall into the enemy's
hands"; But <persName>Tomomori</persName> forbade him. "That must not be ",
he said, "for it has just saved my life." So <persName>Shigeyoshi</persName> did
not shoot. The horse was very loath to leave its master, and
kept close to the ship for a while, swimming right out into the
offing, and it was not until it was at some distance from the
shore that it reluctantly turned round and swam back to the
beach, and even then,' as soon as its feet touched the ground, it
turned again and looked after the ship, neighing loudly three
times.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, as it was resting on the shore, <persName>Kawagoe-no-Kotarō Shigefusa</persName> caught it and brought it to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>. It had
originally been the most prized animal in the <persName>Hō-ō's</persName> stables,
and had been presented to <persName>Munemori</persName> the year before on the
occasion of his becoming <persName>Naidaijin</persName>, and he had given it to
<persName>Tomomori</persName>, and so much did he prize it that he had prayers
offered to <persName>Taisanfukun</persName>, the god of longevity, on its behalf on
the first day of every month. And that is why it was so
long-winded, and was enabled to save its master on this
occasion. It was reared in the province of <placeName>Shinano</placeName> at a place
called <placeName>Inoue</placeName>, and so was called <persName>Inoueguro</persName>, but now, as
<persName>Kawagoe</persName> had caught it, its name was changed to <persName>Kawagoeguro</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Tomomori</persName> entered the presence of the <persName>Daijin
Munemori</persName>, and with tears running down his face, spoke thus:
"How sad am I to be alive when my son <persName>Musashi-no-kami</persName> is
gone, and my retainer <persName>Kenmotsu</persName> is slain also. What is to be
thought of a father like me, who cannot help his son when he
turns the attack of the enemy on to himself to rescue his father,
but leaves him to his fate and saves himself thus? In the
</p>
<p><pb n="161" xml:id="p175-161"/>

case of another I should think that he grudged his life, and
now in my own what shame must I feel to merit a like
reproach? "
And he hid his face in the sleeve of his armour
and sobbed aloud. "Indeed it was a splendid thing that
<persName>Musashi-no-kami</persName> thus gave his life for his father; skilled in
fight and valiant of heart, how great a captain he was! He
was even now the same age as <persName>Kiyomune</persName> here; just sixteen
this year." And looking at his own
son <persName>Uemon-no-kami
Kiyomune</persName>, he too burst into tears.
And none of those
present, even the most hard-hearted,
could refrain from
moistening the sleeves of their armour.

<head>THE FLIGHT.</head>
<p><persName>Bitchū-no-kami Moromori</persName>, the youngest son of <persName>Komatsu
Shigemori</persName>, had just embarked in a small boat with six of his
retainers, when one of the samurai of <persName>Tomomori</persName>, <persName>Seieimon
Kinnaga</persName> by name, galloped down to the water's edge and
begged them to take him on board, so they backed a little way
to take him in. Hastily he jumped in from his horse's back,
and as he was a heavy man and in full armour, and the boat
was small, it rolled over with the shock and capsized. <persName>Bitchū-no-kami</persName> was thrown into the water, and as he was struggling in
the waves, <persName>Honda-no-Jiro Chikatsune</persName>, one of the retainers of
<persName>Hatakeyama</persName>, rode up with thirteen of his men, and quickly

<p>
<persName>Echizen-no-sammi Michimori-no-Kyō</persName> was also in

peace. As he was turning to retire to the eastward for this

purpose, however, he was suddenly surrounded by <persName>Sasaki-no-Kimura Saburo Naritsuna</persName> of <placeName>Omi</placeName> and <persName>Tamii-no-Shirō Sukekage</persName>
of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> with five others, who quickly slew him and cut off
his head. He had with him one retainer only, but when the
end came he too deserted him and escaped.
</p>
<p>
Thus as the day wore on both <persName>Genji</persName> and <persName>Heike</persName> fell in
great numbers at the eastern and western barriers, and before
the towers and beneath the barricades the bodies of men and
horses lay in heaps, while the green grass of <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> and
<placeName>Osasahara</placeName> was turned to crimson. Countless were those who
fell by arrow and sword at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> and <placeName>Ikuta-no-mori</placeName>, by
the hillside and by the strand of the sea. Two thousand heads
did the <orgName>Genji</orgName> take in this battle, and of the <persName>Courtiers</persName> of the
<persName>Heike</persName>, <persName>Echizen-no-Sammi Michimori</persName>, his younger brother
<persName>Kurando-no-taiyū Narimori</persName>, <persName>Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori</persName>,
<persName>Musashi-no-kami Tomoakira</persName>, <persName>Bitchū-no-kami Moromori</persName>, <persName>Owari-no-kami Kiyosada</persName>, <persName>Awaji-no-kami Kiyofusa</persName>, <persName>Kōgō-gū-no-suke
Tsunemasa</persName> the eldest son of <persName>Tsunemori</persName>, his younger brother
<persName>Wakasa-no-kami Tsunetoshi</persName>, and his younger brother <persName>Taiyū
Atsumori</persName>, beside ten others, all fell at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
When their stronghold was thus captured, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were
compelled to put to sea once more, taking the child <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
with them. Some of their vessels were driven by wind and
tide toward the province of <placeName>Kii</placeName>, while others rowed out and
tossed about, buffeted by the waves, in the offing of <placeName>Ashiya</placeName>.
Some rocked on the billows off <placeName>Suma</placeName> and <placeName>Akashi</placeName>, steering
aimlessly hither and thither, their crews weary and dispirited
as they turned on their hard plank couches, and viewed the
moon of spring mistily through their tear-dimmed eyes. Some
crossed the straits of <placeName>Awaji</placeName> and drifted along by <placeName>Ejima-ga-Iso</placeName>,
likening their lot to the sad sea-birds that fly there seeking
by twilight the mate they have lost, while others still lay
off <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> uncertain where to steer. Yesterday, with a
host of a hundred thousand, feared and obeyed by fourteen
provinces, they lay with high hopes but one day's journey
<pb n="163" xml:id="p177-163"/>

from the Capital, and now, after the defeat of <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, they
were scattered and dispersed along the coast, each unaware of
the fate of his friend.

<p>Now <persName>Kenda Takiguchi Tokikazu</persName>, a retainer of <persName>Echizen-
on-Sammi Michimori</persName>, fled in haste to the ship in which was the
wife of <persName>Michmori</persName>, and said to her: "This morning my lord
was surrounded by seven horsemen at the <placeName>Minatogawa</placeName> and
fell fighting, and among them were <persName>Sasaki-no-Kimura Saburō
Naritsuna</persName> of <placeName>Ōmi</placeName>, and <persName>Tamai-no-Shirō Sukekage</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>.
I too would have stayed with him to the end and died, but he
had strictly charged me before, saying that if anything should
happen to him I must at all costs escape to look after my
mistress; and so it is that I have saved my worthless life and
come to you." On hearing these tidings his mistress uttered
no word, but covered her face and fell prostrate. Though she
had already heard that he was dead, she had not at first
believed it, but for two or three days had waited as for one who
had gone out for a short time and would soon come back, but
when four or five days had passed, her confidence was shaken
and she fell into deep melancholy. Her feelings were shared
by her foster-mother who alone accompanied her and shared
the same pillow.
</p>
<p>
From the seventh day, on which the news was brought to
her, until the evening of the thirteenth she did not rise from
her bed. At dawn on the fourteenth day the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were
starting to cross again to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, and until the evening before
she still lay on her couch. Then as night drew on and all was
quiet in the ship, she turned to her foster-mother and said:
"Though I had been told it, until this morning I did not
realize that my husband was dead, but now, this evening, I
know it is true. Everyone says he was killed at the
<pb n="164" xml:id="p178-164"/>

<placeName>Minatogawa</placeName>, and after that there is none who says he has seen
him alive. And what grieves me most is that when I saw him
for a short while on the night before the battle he was sad and
said to me: "I am certain to be slain in to-morrow's battle,
and I wonder what will become of you after I am gone." As
there have been so many battles I did not pay any special heed
to it, but if I had thought that it was the last time indeed, I
would have promised to follow him to the after world. Then,
fearing that he might think me too reseved, I told him what I
had up till that time concealed, that I was 'not-alone.' He was
extremely pleased to hear it and said : Ah, I have reached
thirty years of age without having any children; I hope you
will make it a boy if you can, for that will be a good memento
of myself to leave behind in this fleeting world." Then he
went on to ask me how many months it was, and how I felt,
and bade me keep as quiet as was possible in this ever-rolling
ship that the birth might be easy. Ah, how sad it all is! If
women die at that time it is a most shameful and melancholy
end that they suffer, and yet, if I bear this child and bring
it up so that it may recall to me the features of him who
is gone, every time I look on it will bring back the memory
of my former love, and that will cause me grief without end.
Death is the road that none may avoid. Even if I should by
good luck pass scatheless through these dangerous times, can
I trust myself to escape the common fate of being entangled in
some other passion? That too is a melancholy prospect. To
behold him in my dreams when I sleep, and to awake only to
look on his features! Better to drown in the depths of the sea
than to live on thus bereft of my love. My heart is full of
sorrow at leaving you thus alone, but I pray you send to
<placeName>Miyako</placeName> this letter which I have written, and take my robes to
some priest, that his prayers may hasten the Enlightenment of
my husband, and may assist me too in the after world." When
she had made an end of speaking, the older woman, repressing
her tears, replied: "How can you thus resolve to forsake
<pb n="165" xml:id="p179-165"/>

your little one and leave your mother alone in her old age?
Is your loss any greater than that of the other wives of the
nobles of our house who have fallen at <placeName>Ichi-no tani</placeName>? Though
you may think you will sit on the same lotus as your husband,
yet after rebirth you must both pass though the <term>Six Ways</term> and
the <term>Four Births</term>, and in which of there can you be sure of
meeting? And if you fail to meet, of what use is it to cast
away your life? So be brave and calm your mind until your
child is born, and strive to bring it up, whatever hardships.
may threaten. Then you may become a nun and spend your
days in prayer for the happy rebirth of your departed husband.
Moreover, as for <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, who is there who can carry such
a letter?
</p>
<p>
Then the lady, wishing to comfort and reassure
her weeping parent, replied: "If I seem strange, you must
remember that under the stress of misfortune or the pain of
parting to think of ending one's life is a natural thing, though
really to nerve oneself to do so is not so easy; and if I should
indeed resolve to carry out this intention I will be sure to let
you know. But now it is late and I would sleep." Now her
foster-mother, seeing that the lady had not even taken a bath
for the last four or five days, concluded that her mind was
indeed made up, and had herself determined that if she did
so she would follow her even to the bottom of the sea, for
she did not wish to live a day longer if her daughter was
dead, so for some time she remained awake watching by her
side, but at last she fell asleep, whereupon the lady, who had
been awaiting this opportunity, slipped out quietly and ran to
the bulwarks of the ship. Gazing out over the wide expanse
of waters, she was uncertain in which direction lay the western
quarter, but turning toward the setting moon as it was sinking
behind the mountains, calmly she repeated the <term>Nembutsu</term>.
The melancholy cry of the sea-birds on the distant sand-spits
and the harsh creaking of the rudder mingled with her voice as
she repeated it a hundred times. "<persName>Namu Amida Nyorai</persName>,
Saviour who leadest us to the <placeName>Western Paradise</placeName>, according
<pb n="166" xml:id="p180-166"/>

to Thy True Vow unite on the same lotus flower an
inseparable husband and wife!" And with the last invocation
still on her lips she cast herself into the waves.
</p>
<p>
It was
about midnight of the day on which they were to start for
<placeName>Yashima</placeName>, and all aboard the ship were sleeping soundly, so no
one perceived her. But as she plunged into the waves she
attracted the attention of the helmsman, who alone of the crew
was not asleep, and he cried out loudly that a woman had gone
overboard from the ship, whereon the foster-mother, suddenly
awaking, felt by her side, and finding nothing, was overcome
by sorrow and amazement. Then, though all did their utmost
to get her out of the water and save her life, as usual in spring,
the sky was cloudy and the moon obscured so that they could
not see where she was, and when at last they did discover her
and pull her out of the water, her life was already departing.
Thus they laid her on the deck with the salt water streaming
from her white hakama and the thick double layers of her
First            Court costume, and dripping from her long black hair, and her
foster-mother, taking her hands in hers and pressing her face to
her cold features, exclaimed; "Why did you not let me know
your resolve, and let me follow you to the bottom of the sea ?
Woe is me, now I am left here all alone! At least will you
not speak to me once more?" But though she thus addressed
her daughter in tones of agonized entreaty, she was already
destined for that other world, and her breath, which until now
had just barely fluttered in her body, at last departed for
ever.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the moon of the spring night was sinking in the
sky, and the glimmer of dawn was just beginning to break
through the clouds, grieved to the heart at her loss, as it must
be, they bound a suit of her husband's armour to her body
that it might not rise again, and committed it again to the
waves. Her mother, unwilling to be left behind, tried to leap
in after her, but being prevented by the others, she shaved her
head and was afterwards received as a nun by <persName>Chūnagon-no-Risshi Chūkai</persName>,
<pb n="167" xml:id="p181-167"/>

 the younger brother of the late <persName>Sammi
Michimori</persName>, observing the ordinances of <persName>Buddha</persName> and praying
for the happiness of the deceased. From ancient times it has
been a common custom for women to forsake the world on the
death of their husband, but those who have put an end to their
lives have been few indeed. Still, as there is the injunction,
"A loyal retainer does not serve two masters, nor a chaste
woman have two husbands", such things did sometimes
happen.
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">A loyal retainer, etc. from the <title>ER. DR.</title></note>
<p>
This lady was the daughter of <persName>Tō-no-Gyōbu Kyō
Norikata</persName>, and was the greatest beauty of the Court, where she
was formerly known by the name of <persName>Kozaishō</persName>, being in
attendance on <persName>Joseimon-in</persName>. In the spring of the period Angen,
when she was about sixteen years old, she accompanied her
mistress to <placeName>Hōsshōji</placeName> to view the cherry-blossoms, and <persName>Michimori-no-Kyō</persName>, who was also in attendance as <persName>Chugu-no-suke</persName>,
then first saw her and fell in love with her. From this time he
continued to send her poems and letters, but she only put them
by without taking any notice.
</p>
<p>
After this had gone on for three years <persName>Michimori</persName> wrote
her a letter which he determined should be the last, and sent
it to her by a messenger. It happened on this occasion that
the lady was not to be found, and the servant was returning
again with the letter, when he met <persName>Kozaishō</persName> proceeding from
her residence to the Court. As he did not wish to go back to
his master without delivering the letter, he made as though to
pass close by her carriage and threw it in through the curtain.
Being asked by her companion who was riding with her who
had sent it, she said that she did not know, but on opening it
she found that it was from <persName>Michimori</persName>. As she could not leave
it in the car, and it was not a thing that
could be thrown out
on to the road, she thrust it into the band of her hakama and
so entered the Court. Thereafter it chanced that, while
<pb n="168" xml:id="p182-168"/>

engaged in her duties of lady-in-waiting, though the Palace was
exceedingly wide, she happened to drop it right in front of her
mistress. The <persName>Princess</persName> at once picked it up and put it into the
sleeve of her dress, after which she called her ladies and said to
them : "Here is a strange thing that I have found; to whom
does it belong? All the other ladies swore by the gods and
<persName>Buddhas</persName> that they knew nothing about it, and only <persName>Kozaishō</persName>
blushed furiously and said nothing. Then the <persName>Princess</persName>,
perceiving that the letter was from <persName>Michimori</persName>, opened it to
scan the contents. It was heavily scented with incense and the
writing was extremely elegant. "Although you are very
hard-hearted, I am very delighted......" it began, and when
she had read it through to the end, she found appended the
following verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Like is my love to a bridge that is built of the slippery pine-logs,</l>
<l>If you trample it down, surely my sleeves will be wet."</l>
</lg>
<p>
"This is a very strong letter ", said the <persName>Princess</persName>, “and I
fear, if you are too hard-hearted, this love may turn into hate.
<persName>Ono-no-Komachi</persName> was famous for her beauty, but she did not
know what pity was, and so in time everyone came to hate her.
So, though loved by many, her stony heart in the end brought
her to such a sorry plight that she had not even the
wherewithal to keep off the wind and rain, and was driven to live like
a vagrant in the open fields with nothing but the moon and
stars to gaze at through her tear dimmed eyes. At any rate
an answer must be sent to this letter." And the <persName>Princess</persName>
called for her ink-stone and wrote a reply with her own august
hand.
</p>
<lg>
<l>"If the bridge of logs on which he relies be down-trodden,</l>
<l>Will not she who breaks it certainly fall in the stream?".</l>
</lg>
<p>
Love smoulders in the bosom like the smoke of <placeName>Fuji</placeName>, and
the tears that moisten the sleeve are like the waves of <placeName>Kiyomigaseki</placeName>; so in the end <persName>Michimori</persName> obtained this lovely lady,
<pb n="169" xml:id="p183-169"/>

and their affection for each other was most profound. So she
followed him even to the wind-tossed waves of the <placeName>Western
Sea</placeName>, and in death their path was not divided. <persName>Kadowaki-no-Chūnagon</persName>, thus bereaved both of his eldest son <persName>Echizen-no-Sammi Michimori</persName> and his youngest son <persName>Narimori</persName>, had now
none to rely on save <persName>Noto no-kami Noritsune</persName> and the priest
<persName>Chūnagon-no-Risshi Chūkai</persName>, so the death of this lady, who
was the only legacy of his late son, could only add still more
to his grief.

<head>CARRYING ROUND OF THE HEADS.</head>
<p>On the twelfth day of the second month of Ju-ei the heads
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> that had been cut off on the seventh day at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName> were brought into the Capital, and all those
who were related to them were cast into deep dejection and
mourned together, wondering what evil tidings they might
hear, or what fresh misfortune they might suffer. And among
them the wife of <persName>Komatsu-no-Sammi Chūjō Koremori-no-Kyō</persName>,
who had hidden herself in the temple of <placeName>Daikakuji</placeName>, hearing that
most of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had perished at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, but that one of
them who went by the title of <persName>Sammi Chūjō</persName> had been taken
alive, was in extreme anxiety to know whether it was indeed
her husband. But soon a woman came to the <placeName>Daikakuji</placeName> and
said that this was not so, but that it was <persName>Hon-Sammi Chūjō
Shigehira</persName> who had been taken; whereat her fears were only
increased, lest his head should have been taken with the others.
</p>
<p>
On the thirteenth day the officials of the <persName>Kebiishi</persName> under
<persName>Taiyu-no-Hangwan Nakayori</persName> proceeded to <placeName>Rokujō-kawara</placeName> to
receive the heads, and passed on by <placeName>Higashi-no-Dō-in</placeName> to the
northward, while <persName>Noriyori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> sent word to His
Majesty that they would be exposed on the public gibbet. At
this news the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was much perturbed, and sent for the
<persName>Dajō-daijin</persName>, the <persName>Sadaijin</persName>, <persName>Udaijin</persName>, <persName>Naidaijin</persName> and <persName>Horikawa-no-Dainagon Tadachika-no-Kyō</persName> to consult with them about it.
The five Ministers then said: "From ancient times there is no
precedent for carrying the heads of Ministers and Courtiers
through the streets of the Capital: and moreover these are near
relations of the <persName>Late Emperor</persName> who have for long served at
</p>
<p><pb n="171" xml:id="p185-171"/>

Court. Therefore it is by no means advisable to listen to the
demands of <persName>Noriyori</persName> and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>."
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Hō-ō</persName> accordingly decided that the heads were not to
be exposed, but when this was reported to the two Com-
manders they again insisted, saying: "When we consider the
insurrection of Hogen they were the enemies of our grandfather
<persName>Tameyoshi</persName>, and in the former days of Heiji they were the foes
of our father <persName>Yoshitomo</persName>. Therefore did we jeopardy our lives.
to appease the wrath of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and to cleanse the stain
on our father's memory, by destroying the enemies of the
Throne. If the heads of these <persName>Heike</persName> be not exposed, how
shall we be bold to subdue rebellion in the future?"
And so,
as they thus persisted in their demand, the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> could not but
give way, and the exposure took place at last. Among the
innumerable multitudes that thronged to see them were many
who had feared and dreaded them in the days of their
prosperity, but even these were moved to lamentation when
they saw their heads thus paraded in the public street. Then
<persName>Saitō Go</persName> and <persName>Saitō Roku</persName>, the two brothers who were in
attendance on <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>, the young heir of a <persName>Sammi
Chūjō Koremori</persName>, who was concealed in the <placeName>Daikakuji</placeName>, no
longer able to restain their anxiety, disguised themselves as
menials and mingled with the crowd, looking carefully at all
the heads, but to their joy did not find that of the <persName>Chūjō</persName>
among them. Unable, however, to control their feelings at the
sad sight, they feared the eyes of the crowd, and hastened to
return to the <placeName>Daikakuji</placeName>. Immediately the wife of the <persName>Chūjō</persName>
asked them how they had fared, whereupon they replied:
"Though we looked carefully at all the heads we did not see
that of the <persName>Chūjō</persName> among them. Among the brothers of our
lord, <persName>Bitchu-no-Kami Moromori's</persName> head alone was there: and
beside his there were the heads of so-and-so and so-and-so."
But his mistress could bear no more, and covered her face with
her garment and bowed herself to the ground. After a while
<persName>Saitō Go</persName> controlled his feelings and continued: "For these
<pb n="172" xml:id="p186-172"/>

two years we have been here in hiding, and thus have seen no
one, but now I have been able to look round as I wished, and
moreover I have found out from one who has an exact
knowledge of everything that the lords of the house of <persName>Komatsu
Dono</persName> took no part in this battle. And the reason was that
they were stationed at <placeName>Mikusa-yama</placeName> on the borders of <placeName>Harima</placeName>
and <placeName>Tamba</placeName>, and when this line was broken by <persName>Kurō Yoshi-
tsune</persName>, <persName>Shin-Sammi Chūjō Sukemori</persName>, <persName>Shōshō Arimori</persName> and
<persName>Tango-no-Jiju Tadafusa</persName> took ship from <placeName>Takasago</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName>
and crossed over to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>. Why it was that he
came to be separated from his brothers I know not, but <persName>Bitchu-no-Kami</persName> alone fought and fell at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>." Then, as they
questioned him further about the matter of the <persName>Chūjō Koremori</persName>
he went on: "They say that it was because he was taken with
a grievous sickness that he was not present at this engagement,
but went over to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> before the battle." "Ah"
exclaimed his mistress, "it is because of his anxiety about us,
his anguish of mind when day and night he thinks of our lot,
that he has fallen sick; when the winds are contrary how must
his heart sink to be at sea, and before the battle how dread the
suspense lest it be his last! And on his sick-bed who is there
to soothe his uneasy pillow? Oh, that we could know these
things!" And the young lord and his sister added their
complaint also, saying: "Why did you not find out what
sickness it was?"
</p>
<p>
<persName>Sammi-no-Chūjō</persName> too was equally, tormented by anxious
thoughts: "Alas" he mused, "in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> they will be
wondering what has happened to me; for though my head is.
not there with the others, they cannot be sure that I have not
been drowned or killed by a chance arrow, and so perchance
they think I am no longer of this world." So to let them
know that he was still living he sent a messenger with three
letters, and in that to his wife he wrote: "How sad I am to
think of you living in the Capital surrounded by so many
enemies, and with no proper place to go to: and to have the
<pb n="173" xml:id="p187-173"/>

children to look after must be a greater trial still. How much
would I wish to have you all here together with me, but,
though I can endure it, it would be a cruel place for you."
In this wise he wrote, and among many other things was this
verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"These sad thoughts I indite-like sea-weed gathered together,</l>
<l>As a memento of me, should we meet never again."</l>
</lg>
<p>
"I fear you must find your days very tedious at present
he wrote to his children, “but I intend soon to come and fetch
you."
</p>
<p>
When the messenger arrived at <placeName>Miyako</placeName> with these letters,
and delivered them to his wife, and she opened them and saw
his writing, she was so overcome by her feelings that she could
do nothing but hide her face in her garments and weep.
</p>
<p>
After four or five days had passed the messenger came
and asked her to write an answer that he might start back
again with it, and she did so, bedewing the paper with her
tears. The two children too took up their pens to write and
asked her: "What shall we say in our letters to our father?
"It is best that you write whatever you think ", the lady
answered, and so the two both wrote the same reply. "Why
have you not come to fetch us before this? We are both so
longing to see you again. We hope you will come very
soon." When the messenger returned to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> with these
letters and presented them to the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, and he read those of
his children, he was so affected that he could do nothing.
"Even for the <placeName>Paradise of the West</placeName> I have little care", he
declared, weeping; "for so strong are the bonds of affection
that bind me to this world that Heaven itself has no attraction.
If only I could get across' the mountains to the Capital and
there see my children once again I should be quite content to
die by my own hand."

<p>On the fourteenth day of the same month <persName>Hon-Sammi
Chujō Shigemori-no-Kyō</persName> who had been taken prisoner was
brought into the Capital and paraded through the streets.
The front and back curtains of the car in which he rode were
lifted and the windows on each side were opened, while <persName>Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira</persName>, clad in a hitatare of yellowish-red hue and half
armour, rode in command of thirty men-at-arms who
surrounded the car on all sides. "How sad!" cried all the
people of the Capital on beholding the spectacle, "that of all
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> Courtiers such a fate should befall this one.
He
who was the especial favourite of the <persName>Nyūdō</persName> and his Consort,
the most respected of all their house, and even when he went
to the Court of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> all, both old and young, would make
way in his honour. Surely it is because he burnt the temples
of <placeName>Nara</placeName> that the <persName>Buddhas</persName> have brought this punishment upon
him." Thus they brought him along <placeName>Rokujō</placeName> to the eastward
until they came to the river, and from there returning brought
him to the mansion of the late <persName>Naka-no-Mikado-no Tō-

in solitary confinement.

<p>
Then an envoy was sent to him from the Court of the
<persName>Hō-ō</persName>. He was <persName>Kurando-no-Saemon Gon-no-Suke Sadanaga</persName>,
and he proceeded to <placeName>Hachijō Horikawa</placeName> in robes of dark red
and carrying sword and shaku. <persName>Shigehira</persName> was in robes of
white clouded with blue with a folded eboshi on his head, and
regarded <persName>Sadanaga</persName>, of whom he had formerly thought nothing,
with the same feeling as sinners regard the jailers in <placeName>Hell</placeName>.
"It is His Majesty's decision " quoth <persName>Sadanaga</persName>, that if
you wish to return to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, that you send a message to the
<persName>Heike</persName> Courtiers that they forthwith send back the Three
Sacred Treasures to the Capital, in which case you will be
permitted to go." "I do not think it at all probable", replied
<pb n="175" xml:id="p189-175"/>

<persName>Shigehira</persName>, "that the chiefs of our house will send back the
precious Sacred Treasures in exchange for my person, though
the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName>, since she is a woman, might possibly wish to
do so; still, as it would not be proper to reject the Imperial
Message without further consideration, I will communicate with
them forthwith." One of the retainers of the Court named
<persName>Hanakata</persName> was sent with the Imperial Edict, which was
addressed to the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> and the <persName>Taira Dainagon
Tokitada</persName>, while <persName>Shigehira's</persName> letter to the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName> was
dispatched by the hand of <persName>Heizaemon Shigekuni</persName>. As he was
not allowed to send any private letters beside this, he could
only send messages to various people by word of mouth, and
the one he sent to his wife, <persName>Dainagon-no-Suke</persName> was worded,
thus: "Even on a journey to be separated from those we love,
and who love us, how sad indeed! but as our promise to each
other cannot be dissolved we will surely be reborn to meet
again in the after life": and as he gave the message his feelings
overcame him, so that <persName>Shigekuni</persName> also could not restrain his
tears. Now there was a certain samurai named <persName>Muku
Umanojo Tomotoki</persName>, who had long served <persName>Shigehira</persName>, and was
also in attendance on the lady <persName>Hachijō-no-Nyoin</persName>, and he sought
out <persName>Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira</persName> and said to him: "I am an old
retainer of the <persName>Sammi Chūjō</persName>, and to-day I saw him in the
streets, a spectacle too pitiful to look at. May I not then be
allowed to go to him and comfort him by speaking of old
times? Though I am a samurai, I was not one of those who
accompanied my lord to battle, but was only accustomed to
wait on him morning and evening. If you suspect me of
doubtful designs, I will willingly lay aside my weapons if
permission be granted. So <persName>Sanehira</persName>, feeling compassion, saw
no harm in his request, and he put away his weapons and
was brought to the <persName>Chūjō</persName>. Overjoyed at his success <persName>Umanojō</persName>
hurried to his master's presence, but when he saw how sad and
broken down was his bearing, and thus understood what he
must feel, he could no longer restrain himself, but broke down
<pb n="176" xml:id="p190-176"/>

and wept. The <persName>Chujō</persName> also, feeling as though it were a dream
within a dream, could for a while find nothing to say.
</p>
<p>
Presently, however, they began to talk of past and present
affairs, and then the <persName>Chujō</persName> enquired of him whether a certain
lady, to whom <persName>Umanojō</persName> used to take letters from him, was
still at Court. On the retainer answering that he thought so,
<persName>Shigehira</persName> continued : "As I have written nothing to her
since I went down to the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, and indeed there
was nothing to write, no doubt she thinks I am altogether
faithless, and this grieves me. Could you not take a letter to
her if I write ?" "Indeed that would not be difficult", replied
<persName>Umanojō</persName>, and the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, greatly rejoiced, penned the letter.
The retainer took it and was going forth, when he was stopped
by the guards, who called out, "What letter is that? Show it
to us!" "Show it to them, then!" said the <persName>Chūjō</persName>. "It is of
no matter," replied the warders when they had examined it,
and <persName>Umanojō</persName> received it again and passed out. Hastily
making his way to the Palace, he feared to be seen by people
while it was yet day, and stood waiting in a little hut nar
by until the twilight, when he slipped in as far as the door of
the woman's apartments and listened. There he heard a sound
of weeping and a voice that he thought was that of the lady
he sought exclaiming: "How pitiful! That he of all the
nobles should be treated thus. They all say that it is because
he burned the temples of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, and the <persName>Chūjō</persName> himself says
that so it may be, for though it was not his wish that they
should be burned, some disorderly soldiers of his army started
the fire that destroyed many halls and pagodas, so, as the
saying is", the dew-drops on the topmost leaves all run
down on the trunk ", he must bear the blame for their deed ;
and indeed so I too think." Then <persName>Tomotada</persName>, much touched
by her sorrow, called out to her, and on her asking what he
wished, he told her that he brought a letter from the <persName>Chūjō</persName>.
Then the lady, who at ordinary times was ashamed to show
her face to anyone, ran out hurriedly and took it from him
<pb n="177" xml:id="p191-177"/>

with her own hands, and immediately tearing it open, read all
that he had written to her of how he had been captured in the
West, and was now living in uncertainty of his life from day to
day. In the letter he had inserted these lines:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though in a river of tears my name is sunk and dishonoured,</l>
<l>Happy yet should I be, if I could meet you again."</l>
</lg>
<p>
When she read this the lady could bear no more, but
folded her face in her robe and sank down weeping. After a
while, however, as time was pressing, <persName>Tomotoki</persName> requested that
she give him an answer to take back, and so, weeping bitterly,
she wrote how lonely and sad she had been for the last two
years while she had heard nothing from him, and with the
letter she sent this verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Nought do I also care if with you my name is dishonoured, carried away like waste drifting along on the stream.”</l>
</lg>
<p>
<persName>Tomotoki</persName> took it and returned, and as before he was
stopped by the guard, who demanded to see the letter, but
when they examined it they made no objection, and he
delivered it safely to <persName>Shigehira</persName>. On reading it the <persName>Chūjō</persName> was
greatly affected, and by and by sought an interview with <persName>Doi-no-Jirō</persName>, saying:
"For the many kindnesses you have shown
me I am deeply grateful, and now I would entreat of you yet
one more favour. Since I have no child, I have nothing to
leave behind with regret in this fleeting world; but there is a
lady whom for long I have held in tender regard, and if I
might see her again and speak somewhat about the hereafter, it
would be a great comfort." "There is nothing impossible in
that request", replied <persName>Doi-no-Jirō</persName>, who was not wanting in
compassion, and the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, overjoyed at having obtained
permission, at once borrowed a car and sent it for her. The
lady, without even stopping a moment for any preparation,
immediately got into it and set out, and as soon as they told
the <persName>Chūjō</persName> that her car had arrived at the entrance of the
<pb n="178" xml:id="p192-178"/>

mansion he ran out to her, and exclaiming; "Do not
alight or the guards will see you!" he drew the curtains
of the car, and the two continued sitting there for a long
time, hand in hand and with their faces pressed together,
speaking no word and doing nought but weep.
After a
while <persName>Shigehira</persName> restrained his emotion and said: "When
I went down to the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> I wished to see
you again, but owing to the confusion of those days I had no
one to send, and after that I greatly wished to send you a letter
and to hear from you in return, but the hardships of our
homeless life, and the perils of war both by night and day left
me no leisure; and that I have suffered myself to be captured
alive and brought up to the Capital - it was only that I might
be able to see you once more." And he covered his face
again and wept. How melancholy to think of their mutual
sorrow! Thus the time passed and it began to grow late,
whereupon the warders appeared again and urged the return of
the lady, as the streets might be perilous after dark, so the
<persName>Chūjō</persName> was fain to let her go, but as her car was about to
depart he caught her by the sleeve and extemporised these
lines :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Now let my fleeting life like this our meeting be ended,</l>
<l>Never more shall we meet, this is the last time on earth.”</l>
</lg>
<p>
To which the lady immediately responded:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though we bid adieu ere long to this fleeting existence,</l>
<l>I may have gone before, ere my beloved expires."</l>
</lg>
<p>
So she returned to the Palace and afterwards, as the
warders did not allow them to meet again, they exchanged
letters from time to time. Now this lady was the daughter of
<persName>Mimbu-no-Kyō Nyūdō Shinhan</persName>, and was extremely beautiful,
beside being of a most loving disposition, and when she heard
that the <persName>Chujo</persName> had been handed over to <placeName>Nara</placeName> and executed,
she straightway became a nun, cutting off her hair and putting
on black robes, to pray for his happy rebirth in the after life.

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>THE IMPERIAL EDICT TO YASHIMA.</head>
<p>After a few days the Imperial Messenger <persName>Hanakata</persName>,
Groom of the Imperial Bedchamber, arrived at the shore of
<placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName> on the twenty eighth day of the same
month, and presented the Edict of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>. The <persName>Daijin
Munemori</persName> and all the <persName>Heike Courtiers</persName> met in solemn assembly
to hear it, and it was opened and read thus :
</p>
<p>
"That the August Person of the Divine Sovereign should
leave the <placeName>Ninefold Precincts of the Palace</placeName> and journey through
the provinces, and that the Three Sacred Treasures should be
hidden in <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> for so many years, is a great calamity to the
Imperial Court, and may be the cause of our country's ruin.
Now this <persName>Shigehira no-Kyō</persName> is the disloyal subject who burnt
the <placeName>Tōdaiji</placeName> at <placeName>Nara</placeName>, and according to the advice of Our
Minister <persName>Yoritomo</persName> whom we have consulted should properly
be put to death. Separated from those of his family he was
captured alive, and now languishes in captivity like a caged
bird that pines for the sky, or, like a wild goose that has lost
his mates, he would fly back to the far-away isle in the
southern seas where is the Palace of his Imperial Lord. But if
the Three Sacred Treasures be returned to the Capital
forthwith, this rebel lord shall receive our Imperial Forgiveness.
This is Our Imperial Edict. Given on the fourteenth day of
the second day of the third year of Ju-ei by the hand of
<persName>Daizen-no-Taiyū Naritada</persName>. To the former <persName>Taira Dainagon</persName>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4" xml:id="v10_ch4">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>THE ANSWER.</head>
<p>The purport of the Imperial Edict was forthwith
communicated by the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> to the <persName>Taira Dainagon
Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName>. Then the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> opened the let er of
<persName>Shigemori</persName>, which ran as follows: "If you wish to see me
<pb n="180" xml:id="p194-180"/>

again alive, see to it that the Three Sacred Treasures be
sent back again to the Capital; if this be not done consider
that you will never see me again"; and when she read
these words she was so affected by them that she pushed
the doors that led to the next room where all the <persName>Courtiers</persName>
were assembled, and with the letter pressed to her face,
threw herself down before <persName>Munemori</persName>, quite unable to utter
a single word. After a short space, however, she arose, and
controlling her emotion addressed him thus: "See here,
<persName>Munemori</persName>! How pitiful is the message I have received from
the <persName>Chujō</persName> at <placeName>Miyako</placeName>! . Anxious indeed must be the thoughts
of his heart. Allow me then to have the Three Sacred
Treasures sent back to the Capital." "I also", replied
<persName>Munemori</persName>" might wish to do this thing, but to exchange the
Three Sacred Treasures of our Realm for <persName>Shigehira</persName> would be
a most improper act. Moreover with respect to <persName>Yoritomo</persName> I
think it would avail nothing. And the maintaining of the
Sovereign Power of the Empire depends on the presence of the
Sacred Mirror alone. And how can you consider the welfare
of one child, when all the others and our friends will suffer
detriment on account of it? Even affection for children must
be according to circumstances. By no means can this thing
be done." But the <persName>Nii Dono</persName>, reluctant to give up her wish,
still persisted: "For myself I did not desire to live a day or
an hour after the death of the late Chancellor, my husband,
and it is only that I would see his Sacred Majesty again come
to his own, after tossing so long on the waters of the <placeName>Western
Sea</placeName>, that I have survived to this day. When I heard that the
<persName>Chujo</persName> had been captured at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, my breast was
straitened and my throat obstructed so that I could not even
drink hot water, and if I hear that he is no longer of this
world I also will depart with him, so pray kill me at once that
I may be troubled no more." And she cried and groaned
aloud, so that all the assembly cast down their eyes in
embarassment.
</p>
<p><pb n="181" xml:id="p195-181"/>

Then the <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> delivered his
opinion as follows: "Even though we should send back
the Three Sacred Treasures to the Capital, it is doubtful
whether they would return <persName>Shigehira</persName> to us. Is it not well
then to send a reply to that effect?" To this counsel all
assented, and the <persName>Daijin</persName> set about composing the reply, while
the <persName>Nii Dono</persName>, who was so overcome that she could scarcely
hold the pen, yet, nerved by her great affection for
<persName>Shigehira</persName>, also began to write an answer. <persName>Dainagon-no-Suke</persName>,
the wife of the <persName>Chujō</persName>, could say nothing, but only covered
her face and wept.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Taira-no-Dainagon Tokitada</persName> ordered the Imperial
Envoy <persName>Hanakata</persName> to be summoned, and thus addressed him :
Since you have thus braved the perils of the waves, and have
made this long journey to this far-off island, I will give you a
souvenir of your exploit that you will carry with you all your
days." And he had the two characters <foreign xml:lang="ja">Namikata</foreign>' branded
on his face with a hot iron. When he returned to the Capital
and the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> saw it, he asked him,
"Are you <persName>Hanakata</persName> ? '
"I am,'
was the reply. "Then," said the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> with a laugh,
"
we must call you '<persName>Namikata</persName>' in future"; after which he
read the answer, which ran as follows:
</p>
<p>
"The Imperial Edict dated the fourteenth of this month has
arrived here at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in <placeName>Sanuki</placeName> on the twenty eighth day,
and has been respectfully perused by us, and thus do we think
concerning what is written in it. <persName>Michimori-no-Kyō</persName> and many
others of our house have already been slain at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>:
what then have we to rejoice at if <persName>Shigehira</persName> alone is pardoned ?
Our Sovereign, having received the succession to the Throne
of the late <persName>Emperor Takakura-in</persName>, was only four years old when
he began to reign, and while he was learning the way of
benevolent and virtuous government, <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, the barbarian
of the East, and <persName>Yoshinaka</persName>, the rebel of the North, plotted
together, and gathering their forces entered the Capital, thus
causing grievous affliction to the youthful Sovereign and his
<pb n="182" xml:id="p196-182"/>

August Mother, and no small indignation to the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and
<roleName>Ministers</roleName> their relations. For a considerable period they
retired to the isles of <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, and until they return to the
Capital how shall the Three Sacred Treasures be separated
from his August Person? As the Chinese Classic says, “The
Subject considers the Sovereign as his mind, and the Sovereign
considers the subject as his body." If the Sovereign be
demeaned, so will the subject be also, and if the subject be
demeaned, so also will the country be too. If the Sovereign
above mourns, how can the subject below rejoice? And if
the heart within be filled with grief, how can the body without
be glad? Since the time that our ancestor <persName>Taira Sadamori</persName>
subdued the rebel <persName>Söma-no-Kojiro Masakado</persName>, pacifying the
eight provinces of the East, the tradition has been handed down
to his sons and grandsons, so that they have put down
rebellious subjects, and through succeeding ages have loyally
guarded the Sacred Destiny of the Throne. Thus it was that
our late father the <persName>Dajō-dajin Kiyomori</persName>, in the periods of
Hogen and Heiji held in great respect the Imperial Wishes, but
paid little regard to his own life; thus acting entirely on behalf
of his Sovereign, but for himself not at all. And as for this
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>, though when, on account of the treason of his father
<persName>Sama-on-kami Yoshitomo</persName> in the twelfth month of the first year
of Heiji, many were constantly demanding his execution, the
late Chancellor out of the kindness of his heart was pleased to
pardon him, yet he forgets all this former obligation and is
entirely unmindful of any gratitude. Straightway gathering
together hordes of rebels, in traitorous wise he wrought
exceeding folly beyond description. Soon may they invite the
punishment of heaven, and the hour of their ruin and defea: be
privily ordained. The sun and moon darken not their light for
one thing, neither does the <persName>Buddha</persName> alter the Law for one man.
One evil deed should not cancel many virtuous acts, neither
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">Chinese Classic 禮​託​,臣​軌</note>
<p><pb n="183" xml:id="p197-183"/>

should a small blemish cover up great merit. If the faithful
service of our house for many generations, and the many loyal
deeds of our late father, had not been forgotten, what need would
there have been for our Sovereign to proceed to <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> ?
Let an Imperial Edict then be issued that we may return
once again to our ancient Capital, and our former shame
be put away. For if not we shall go to <placeName>Korea</placeName>, or <placeName>China</placeName>, or
<placeName>India</placeName>, or the uttermost confines of the demon-world. What a
calamity! Are the Sacred Treasures of our Imperial Realm,
handed down through eighty one generations of Earthly
Sovereigns, to become but the vain ornaments of an alien
land? Let this our meaning be brought plainly before His
Majesty. Given with the utmost respect and obeisance on
the twenty eighth day of the second month of the third year
of Ju ei. The answer of <persName>Taira Munemori Ason</persName>, former
Naidaijin of the Lower First Rank."

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>RECEIVING THE DOCTRINE.</head>
<p>When the <persName>Chujō Shigehira</persName> was informed of the reply that
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had made, he said: "That is just what I had
expected no doubt the rest of the family have but a poor
opinion of me." He felt some disappointment, it is true, but
there was no help for it, and indeed he had not considered it
likely that they would be ready to return the Three Sacred
Treasures as the price of his release. So the purport of the
reply caused him no surprise, though naturally, while the
matter was yet undecided, he could not help feeling unsettled,
and as, when the answer was received, it was resolved to send
him down to the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, he felt great regret at
leaving the Capital. Calling <persName>Doi-no-Jirō</persName>, he asked him whether
they would permit him to become a monk, but when this
request was communicated to <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> and by him reported
<pb n="184" xml:id="p198-184"/>

to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, His Majesty decided that he could not give
his consent until the question had been referred to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>.
"Then" said the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, "may I not be allowed to see a
priest who is an old friend of mine, that I may speak
with him somewhat about the after life?" "Who is the
priest?" asked <persName>Doi</persName>. "<persName>Hōnembō</persName> of <placeName>Kurodani</placeName>",
was the
reply. "In that case there is no objection ", he answered,
and gave permission.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Chujo</persName>, much pleased at this, soon called the priest,
and on his arrival, said to him, weeping; "Though I have
been taken alive after many dangers in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>,
and brought up to the Capital, yet it is a happy thing for me
in that I can thus meet you again. But what will my fate be
in the hereafter? While I had rank and place in the world,
distracted by many affairs and held fast in the bonds of the
things of this life, my heart was wholly given up to pride,
without a thought for what vicissitudes might happen to me.
Still more when misfortune overtook our house and we fled the
Capital, fighting and struggling here and there, my mind was
clogged with the evil desire of killing others and saving my
own life, so that no good thoughts could dwell in me. As to
the burning of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, whether we say it was an Imperial Order,
or the chance of war, at His Majesty's Behest, since the way of
this world is difficult to escape, on account of the evil deeds of
the monks we marched against them, and the chance burning
of the temples that followed was beyond my power to prevent.
Still, as I was the Commander at that time, if punishment is to
fall on one person, it must be on my head that it will fall. So
whatever shame may overwhelm me I know that it is but
retribution for this deed. Therefore I would shave my head
and go as a mendicant priest, practising austerities and seeking
only the Way of <persName>Buddha</persName>. But even if I could do this in the
body, I cannot believe that my heart would be changed; for
whatever austerities I might practise would not be enough to
attain salvation. Alas! When I think over the conduct of my
<pb n="185" xml:id="p199-185"/>

past life, my guilt is greater than <placeName>Mount Sumeru</placeName>, while all my
righteousness is less than a speck of dust; and if thus in vain.
I end my life, without doubt I shall be reborn in the <term>Three
Ways of Torment</term>. And so I beseech you, O <persName>Shōnin</persName>, of
your kindness and compassion deign to help even such a
worthless one as myself, and to show me how to achieve
salvation."
</p>
<p>
At this melancholy speech the <persName>Shōnin</persName>, overcome by
grief, bowed his face to the ground, and for a long while,
choked by sobs, could answer nothing. By and by,
however, he raised himself and spoke as follows: "After with
difficulty attaining to birth as man, to fall again into the
"<term>Three Ways of Torment</term> is too grievous a lot. But if in
disgust at this sinful world, you seek rebirth in the <placeName>Pure
Land</placeName>, cleansing your mind of evil and turning to good, of
a surety all the <persName>Buddhas</persName> of the <placeName>Three Worlds</placeName> will rejoice
and, be glad.
</p>
<p>
In times of degeneracy and of the <term>Five Corruptions</term>, by
faith in the name of <persName>Amida</persName> we can prevail. Thus fixing the
whole mind on His <placeName>Paradise</placeName>, and concentrating all austerities
into the repetition of the <term>Six Character Invocation</term>, none can be
so dull or ignorant but his prayer will be heard, nor will any
be despised, be his guilt never so deep. If you turn from the
<term>Ten Transgressions</term> and the <term>Five Rebellions</term>, you will attain
<placeName>Paradise</placeName>, and however small your merit, your hope will
not be disappointed. If with earnest mind you repeat the
<term>Nembutsu</term>, surely <persName>Amida</persName> will come to meet you. If, with the
full knowledge that <placeName>Paradise</placeName> is to be obtained by the repetition
of the <term>Nembutsu</term>, you wholeheartedly repeat it, then <placeName>Paradise</placeName>
is yours. If you say that repeating it means repentance, and
thus repeat it, you do indeed repent. If you trust in <persName>Amida</persName>
the All-Powerful, no evil Karma can approach, and if you have
faith in the <term>Nembutsu</term> to cleanse from sin, all your sins will be
washed away. The peculiar advantage of the <placeName>Pure Land</placeName> Sect
lies in this, that it sums up the whole doctrine in this one
<pb n="186" xml:id="p200-186"/>

sentence: "The attainment of <placeName>Paradise</placeName> depends on Faith."
And if you deeply believe this teaching, without departing
from the ordinary avocations and limitations of daily life,
and still observing the <term>Three Actions</term> and the <term>Five Dignities</term>,
if you do not neglect to repeat the <term>Nembutsu</term> with fervour,
when the hour of death approaches, departing out of this
world of trouble, you shall without doubt be reborn into
the changeless bliss of the <placeName>Western Paradise</placeName>." At this
exposition the <persName>Chujō</persName> was greatly rejoiced, and replied: "I
pray you straightway let me receive the Ten Precepts;
but is it possible that I can do this without becoming a
monk?" "Indeed", said the <persName>Shōnin</persName>, "it is quite usual
to observe the Ten Precepts without becoming a monk."
And taking a razor he laid it on his forehead, and made
the motions of shaving his head, after which he instructed
him in the Ten Precepts. The <persName>Chūjō</persName> received his instruction
with tears of gladness, and the <persName>Shōnin</persName> too, being a man of
sympathy in all things, taught him the ordinances in a voice
broken by sobs. Then sending for his inkstone, which he had
deposited with the samurai, he handed it to the <persName>Shōnin</persName>, saying :
"Do not give this to anyone, but please keep it always near
you; and whenever you look at it, remember that it belonged
to a certain person, and deign to say a <term>Nembutsu</term>. Moreover
if you can spare time, please send me a volume of the <title>Sutras</title>."
At this the <persName>Shōnin</persName> could find nothing to say, but, putting the
inkstone into his bosom, he pressed to his face the sleeve of his
black robe, and weeping bitterly returned to <placeName>Kurodani</placeName>. This
inkstone was one that the <persName>Sung Emperor</persName> had sent as a return
gift to his father, the <persName>Nyūdō</persName>, when the Chancellor had sent a
present of golddust to <placeName>China</placeName>, and was inscribed, "to the Great
Minister of the <orgName>Taira</orgName> of <placeName>Wada</placeName> in <placeName>Japan</placeName>." Its name was

<head>THE SEA ROAD.</head>
<p>Now since <persName>Hyōye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> had given repeated
orders to that effect, there was nothing for it but that <persName>Shigehira</persName>
should go down to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, and so he was handed over by
<persName>Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira</persName> and sent to the quarters of <persName>Kurō Onzōshi
Yoshitsune</persName>, and on the tenth day of the third month he set out,
accompanied by <persName>Kajiwara Heizō Kagetoki</persName>. It was a sad fate
for him to be taken alive and sent to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> after all the
hazards of the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, but how much worse was
it now to have to travel even beyond the <placeName>Eastern Barrier</placeName>.
When they came to <placeName>Shi-no-miya Kawara</placeName>, he remembered how
formerly the fourth Imperial Prince of <persName>Enki</persName> called <persName>Semi-Maru</persName>
had calmed his mind amid the Eastern tempests by playing his
biwa in this spot, and how <persName>Hakuga-no-Sammi</persName>, persevering for
three years both on gusty days and calm, on rainy nights and
fine, pacing up and down and standing to listen, received from
him the three secret melodies. In those days too, he thought,
it was hard to live in a straw thatched hut. Passing over
<placeName>Ausaka-yama</placeName> the hoofs of their horses echoed as they rode
over the <placeName>Bridge of Seta</placeName>, and the sky-lark rose in the heavens.
The village of <placeName>Noro</placeName> and the waves of <placeName>Shiga</placeName> were shrouded in
the mist of spring, and leaving <placeName>Kagami-yama</placeName> and the lofty peak
of <placeName>Hira</placeName> on the north, the hill of <placeName>Ibuki</placeName> drew nigh. Though not
of much interest, the crumbling wooden eaves of the barrier of
<placeName>Fuwa</placeName> had a certain charm, while the ebbing tide of the bay
of <placeName>Narumi</placeName> suggested sad forebodings of the future that
moistened his sleeve with tears. As they came to <placeName>Yabase</placeName> in <placeName>Mikawa</placeName>
they thought of <persName>Ariwara-no-Nar hira</persName>, and the famous stanza that
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><persName>S mi-Maru</persName>. In the Konjaku Monogatari he is said to have been the
servant of <persName>Prince Atsuzane</persName>, the eighth son of the <persName>Emperor Uda</persName>. <persName>Enki</persName>
signifies the <persName>Emperor Daigo</persName>.</note>

<p><pb n="188" xml:id="p202-188"/>

he made there, beginning, "<foreign xml:lang="ja">Karakoromo kitsutsu nare ni shi</foreign>”;
and as they watched the parting of the waters, this too caused
them sad reflections. As they passed over the bridge of <placeName>Hamana</placeName>,
the wind was blowing in the pines, and the sound of the waves
smote on their ears at <placeName>Irie</placeName>; but even without these mournful
sounds the journey would have been melancholy enough.
</p>
<p>
As evening drew on they came to <placeName>Ikeda</placeName> in <placeName>Tōtōmi</placeName>, and at
this station the <persName>Chujo</persName> lodged at the house of a certain <persName>Lady-in-
waiting</persName> who was the daughter of one <persName>Yuya</persName>, a wealthy man of
that place. When the lady perceived the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, she said:
"How strange that such a personage should come to a poor
place like this, of which he has not even thought": and she
sent him the following verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"When on a journey you rest in a lowly ana smoke-begrimed cottage,</l>
<l>Then your Miyako home dearer and fairer appears."</l>
</lg>
<p>
The <persName>Chujo</persName> replied:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"On such a journey as this what boots it to wish for Miyako?</l>
<l>Since I can call it home never again in this life."</l>
</lg>
<p>
After a while the <persName>Chūjō</persName> summoned <persName>Kajiwara</persName> and enquired
of him: "Who is the author of that verse? It must be a
person of some elegance." "Perhaps your lordship does not
know", replied <persName>Kagetoki</persName>, "but this lady is one who was
greatly beloved by the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> when he was Governor
of this province, and was summoned to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> by him, but as
she had left an old mother in this place, she was always asking
permission of him to return, which he would not grant; and in
the early part of the third month she made this well-known
stanza and sent it to him:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Sad though I feel to miss the beauties of spring in Miyako,</l>
<l>In my loved Eastern land haply the flowers may fall."</l>
</lg>
<p><pb n="189" xml:id="p203-189"/>

And so he at length allowed her to depart. In all this
<placeName>Tōkaidō</placeName> district there is none other like her.”
</p>
<p>
Some days had now passed since they left the Capital, and
the third month was half over. The flowers on the far-away
mountains they sometimes mistook for the late-lying snow, and
over the bays and islets the mist slowly drifted, and as the
<persName>Chūjō</persName> rode on he brooded over his past life and what was to
befall. By what karma-relation in a former life had this
misfortune come upon him? Verily the only abiding thing
was tears! His mother the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> and his wife <persName>Dainagon-no-Suke</persName> had often regretted that he had no child, and had
prayed fervently to the gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName> to grant them one,
but with no effect. "Perhaps it is as well," quoth <persName>Shigehira</persName>,
"for where there is no child there is the less to regret."
</p>
<p>
When they came to <placeName>Sayo-no-Nakayama</placeName> and thought that
they had to pass over it, they felt the more grieved, and again
their sleeves were wet. <placeName>Utsu-no-Yamabe</placeName>, with its ivied path,
though it depresses them is passed too, and they go on through
<placeName>Tegoshi</placeName>, when afar off to the north a snow-clad peak appears,
and on asking, the <persName>Chujō</persName> is told it is called <placeName>Kai-no-Shirane</placeName>, the
white peak of the province of <placeName>Kai</placeName>. Repressing his tears he
makes this verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Little reck I of life indeed, but to-day for the first time</l>
<l>Clear before my eyes looms the White Peak of Reward."</l>
</lg>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">Peak of Reward. The word Kai has also this meaning.</note>
<p>
Passing by <placeName>Kiyomi-ga-seki</placeName> they entered the plain at the
foot of Mount <placeName>Fuji</placeName>: on the. north lay the steep green slope of
the mountain with its pine-trees rustling in the breeze, and on
the south lay the wide expanse of blue sea with its waves for
ever rolling up on the shore. They then passed over <placeName>Ashigara-
yama</placeName>, the <persName>Myōjin</persName> of which place is recorded to have made
this verse concerning his wife: "If you love, your body
<pb n="190" xml:id="p204-190"/>

becomes wasted, and as it is not, you do not love." Then they
came to <placeName>Koyurugi-no-mori</placeName> and <placeName>Mariko-kawa</placeName>, and the shore
of <placeName>Koiso</placeName> and <placeName>Oiso</placeName>, and after passing <placeName>Yatsuma</placeName>, <placeName>Togami-ga-hara</placeName>
and <placeName>Mikoshi-ga-saki</placeName>, having spent many days on the way,
though they had not seemed to hurry, they came at last to
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName>.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7" xml:id="v10_ch7">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>SENSHU.</head>
<p>So <persName>Sammi Chūjō</persName> was brought into the presence of <persName>Hyōye-no-suke</persName>, and <persName>Yoritomo</persName> thus addressed him: "To appease
the Imperial displeasure, and to wipe away the stain from
my father's memory I have undertaken to overthrow the
<persName>Heike</persName> family, and it will not be difficult to accomplish;
but verily I did not at all expect to see you here under these
circumstances. As it is, perchance I may have the honour of
receiving the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> as well. But concerning the
burning of the temples of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, whether it was done by the
command of the late <persName>Nyūdō Kiyomori</persName>, or whether it was
ordered by you on the spur of the moment, I know not; but
anyhow it was an exceeding heinous crime." "It was done
neither by the command of the <persName>Nyūdō</persName>, nor by my own
design", replied the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, "but it happened accidentally in
the course of the operations we undertook to suppress the
violence of the monks. I beg your indulgence to speak of a
fresh subject, but, as you know, in former days the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and
<persName>Heike</persName> families stood together in rivalry to support the Throne,
and after that the fortunes of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> house declined, and our
family alone, since the days of Hogen and Heiji, has many
times subdued the Imperial enemies, and been rewarded for its
services, even, I speak it with reverence, so far as to be
permitted to become Imperial Relatives, and to hold the office
of <persName>Dajō-daijin</persName>; while no less than sixty members of the family
</p>
<p><pb n="191" xml:id="p205-191"/>

have been promoted to high office, so that for twenty years
there has been none to equal it in all the land for rank and
authority. Now it is said that he who fights the battles of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> shall not be bereft of the Imperial Favour for seven
generations; but this I think is quite false, for though the late
<persName>Nyūdō</persName> hazarded his life for the Throne many times, it was his
generation only that was fortunate and happy, and his children
have come to this state that you behold. Our fate has come upon
us and our rule is overthrown: fugitives from the Capital, our
corpses bleach on mountain and plain, and men would spread
our shame far over the waves of the <placeName>Western Ocean</placeName>. That I
should thus be taken alive and brought down hither is a thing
of which I never dreamed, and I can but regard it as the result
of the misdeeds of a former life. It is related in history how in
<placeName>China</placeName> king <persName>In</persName> of <placeName>To</placeName> was captured at <placeName>Ka-dai</placeName>, and how king
<persName>Bun</persName> was held prisoner at <placeName>Yū-ri</placeName>; and if there were such examples
in antiquity, how should the men of this age fare better? It is
not really such a disgrace for a warrior to fall into the hands of
his enemy and be put to death, so I pray you of your favour
grant me a speedy execution." As he thus finished speaking,
<persName>Kajiwara</persName> exclaimed in admiration : "Ah! There is a great
leader indeed! And both he and the samurai in attendance
could not refrain from pressing their sleeves to their eyes.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> too was not unaffected by his bearing: "Far be it
from me to regard the <orgName>Taira</orgName> house as my personal foes", he
exclaimed in reply", it is only that I carry out the Imperial
Order: as for the burning of the temples of the <placeName>South Capital</placeName>,
let that be settled by the decision of the monks themselves."
And he ordered that the <persName>Chūjō</persName> should be placed in charge of
<persName>Kanō-no-suke Munemochi</persName> of the province of <placeName>Izu</placeName>. A treatment
that seemed just like the handing over of the sinners of the
<placeName>Shaba-world</placeName> to the <persName>Ten Kings</persName> for seven days each. But this
<persName>Kanō-no-suke</persName> was a merciful man and did not treat the <persName>Chūjō</persName>
at all severely, but was very kind to him in all things. And
first of all he led him away to take a hot bath. Now the
<pb n="192" xml:id="p206-192"/>

<persName>Chūjō</persName> thought he could meet any fate calmly if he could wash
away the dust and grime of the road, and make himself clean
again, and was just taking his bath, when after a little while the
door of the bath-room was opened and there entered a beautiful
girl of about twenty years old, with a fine white complexion and
very lovely hair. She was wearing a bath-robe of unlined
material dyed in colours, and was attended by a little maid of
fourteen or fifteen with short hair, dressed in an unlined
garment of white, dyed with a blue design here and there, and
carrying some combs in a small wash-basin. This lady assisted
the <persName>Chujō</persName> in his bath for some time, and then, after she had
washed her hair, made to depart again, but as she was going
out she said to him: "I am one of these who have access to
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>, so if there is anything you wish, please tell me, and
I will ask him; this may be difficult for a man, but a woman
can manage these things." "In this condition, what can I
want?" replied the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, "there is only one thing that I
could desire, and that is to be allowed to become a monk."
This request the lady repeated to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, but he replied:
"That cannot be. If he were my own enemy, it might be, but
as he is an enemy of the Throne it is not possible." When the
lady brought this answer to the <persName>Chujo</persName>, after she had retired
again he asked his guard what might be the name of this
very elegant visitor. "She is the daughter of the <persName>Chōja</persName> of
<placeName>Tegoshi</placeName>", said <persName>Kanō-no-suke</persName>, "and she is equally winsome in
face and figure and disposition; she has been in attendance on
the lord <persName>Hyōye-no-suke</persName> for some two or three years, and her
name is <persName>Senshu-no-Mae</persName>."
</p>
<p>
That evening was somewhat rainy, and everything was
very dreary, when the lady again appeared bringing a biwa
and koto. <persName>Kanō-no-suke</persName> also came in with ten of his attendants
and brought wine before the <persName>Chūjō</persName>, which <persName>Senshū-no-Mae</persName>
served to him. <persName>Shigehira-no-Kyō</persName> took a little, but seemed
rather indifferent to their attentions, whereupon <persName>Kanō-no-suke</persName>
spoke as follows: "I am a man of the province of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, and
<pb n="193" xml:id="p207-193"/>

am only a sojourner in <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, but I will do anything I
can to serve you; and <persName>Hyōye-no-suke Doño</persName> has ordered that
we accede to any wishes you may have, so please command us.
So let saké be served." So <persName>Senshu-no-Mae</persName> brought him saké
and recited once and again the piece entitled: "I am angry
with the weaving-woman for the heaviness of my silken robe."
"Though <persName>Kitano Tenjin</persName> swore that he would hasten three
times a day to protect him who sings this verse ", said the
<persName>Chūjō</persName>, "seeing that I am one forsaken and without hope in
this world, of what avail is it to join in the singing; still, if it
will at all lessen my guilt, I will do so." Then <persName>Senshu</persName> sang the
refrain entitled: "Even the Ten Transgressions, they shall be
taken away", and then sang four or five times the Imayō
measure: "Let all who desire <placeName>Paradise</placeName> call on the name of
<persName>Amida</persName>." Then the <persName>Chujo</persName> drained his cup, and <persName>Senshu</persName> took
it and gave it to <persName>Kano-no-suke</persName>, and while he was drinking
she played the biwa. This melody is usually called
<term>Gojō-raku</term>", said the <persName>Chūjō</persName> in jest; "but now it seems
to me like <term>Goshō-raku</term> (songs of the next world); so I
will sing the piece called <term>Ojō-no-kyū</term> (hastening to heaven):
and he took the biwa and tuned it, and sang the melody
<term>Ojō-no-kyū</term>.
</p>
<p>
And so the night grew on, and his heart became free of
care, and he said: "Who would have thought to find such.
grace in the <placeName>Fastern Provinces</placeName> ? Let us have another song."
So <persName>Senshu-no-Mae</persName> sang several times with great feeling the
<term>Shirabyōshi</term> refrain: "Those who find shelter beneath one
tree, or those who snatch a draught from the same stream; it
is naught but the promise of a former life." Then the <persName>Chujō</persName>
also sang: "The tears of <persName>Gu-shi</persName> when the light grew dim."
And the meaning of this song is as follows: when in old time
in <placeName>China</placeName> the <persName>Emperor Kōso</persName> of <placeName>Kan</placeName> strove with <persName>Kō-u</persName> of <placeName>Sō</placeName>,
<persName>Kō-u</persName> triumphed in seventy-two battles, but at length he was
beaten and his army routed. Then, springing on to his
horse <persName>Sui</persName>, famous for its wondrous strength and swiftness, he
<pb n="194" xml:id="p208-194"/>

made to escape with his consort <persName>Gu-shi</persName>, when strange to say
the horse set both his feet firm and refused to move. Shedding
tears of chagrin <persName>Kō-u</persName> exclaimed: 'My power is already
gone, and for the attacks of the enemy I care nothing,
all that grieves me is the parting with this lady." It is
the scene of <persName>Gu-shi</persName> weeping in the waning light, as the
troops of the enemy came shouting down on all sides, that
<persName>Kisshō-kō</persName> has represented in this poem, and it was a sign
of the Chujo's artistic feeling that he chose it to sing on
this occasion.
</p>
<p>
So they went on until the day was about to break, when
<persName>Kano-no-suke</persName> took leave of the <persName>Chujō</persName>, and <persName>Senshu-no-Mae</persName>
returned also. That morning it chanced that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was
reading the <title>Hokke Sutras</title> in the <placeName>Jibutsu-dō</placeName> when she came
back, and he turned to her with a smile and remarked: "No
doubt the entertainment last night was very amusing?" At
this <persName>Sai-in-no-Jikwan Chikayoshi</persName>, who was writing something
in his presence, asked what he meant. "For the last two or
three years the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have experienced nothing but hardships
and fighting", said <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, "and yet so charming was the
playing and singing of <persName>Sammi Chūjō</persName> that I stood all night
outside listening to it. He is indeed a fine artist." "I too
should have liked to hear it ", replied <persName>Chikayoshi</persName>, "but I had
some other business last night and so I could not; but I will
take the first chance of doing so henceforth. The <persName>Heike</persName> have
always produced many talented muscians and artists, and a
while ago when they were comparing each other to various
flowers, they decided that <persName>Sammi-Chūjō</persName> was the peony among
them." At any rate his playing the biwa and singing so
impressed <persName>Yoritomo</persName> that he never forgot it.
</p>
<p>
When <persName>Senshu-no-Mae</persName> afterwards heard that the <persName>Chujō</persName>
had been sent to <placeName>Nara</placeName> and put to death there, the tidings so
affected her that she retired from the world and became a nun,
entering the temple of <placeName>Zenkōji</placeName> in <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, there to pray for
his happy rebirth in <placeName>Paradise</placeName>.

<head>YOKOBUE.</head>
<p>Now though the body of <persName>Komatsu-no-Sammi Chūjō
Koremori</persName> was in <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, yet his heart was ever in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>,
for never for a moment was his mind free from anxiety about
his wife and little ones whom he had left in the Capital. Unable
at last to bear the suspense, on the fifteenth day of the third
month of the third year of Ju-ei, he slipped out of his house at
<placeName>Yashima</placeName> at dawn and departed, accompanied by <persName>Yosōhyōye
Shigekage</persName>, his page <persName>Ishidō Maru</persName>, and a <persName>Toneri</persName> named <persName>Takesato</persName>,
who was included because he understood ships. With these
three he took ship at <placeName>Yuki-no-ura</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Awa</placeName>, and
after passing by the offing of <placeName>Naruto</placeName>, they shaped their course
towards <placeName>Kii</placeName>, passing on their way the shrines of <persName>Tamatsu-shima
Myojin</persName>, (who is worshipped as the god of <placeName>Waka</placeName>, <placeName>Fukiage</placeName> and
<persName>Sotōri-hime</persName>), <persName>Nichizen</persName> and <persName>Kokken</persName>, and arriving at last at
<placeName>Minato</placeName> in <placeName>Kii</placeName>. Thence he thought to go by the hills to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>
and meet his wife and children, but when he remembered
how his uncle the <persName>Chujō Shigehira</persName> had been taken alive, and
exposed to the shame of being carried thus to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, he feared to heap shame on his father's grave if he
also were taken, and though his feelings naturally dragged him
in that direction, he fought them down and proceeded to <placeName>Kōya</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now in <placeName>Kōya</placeName> there was a certain saintly priest whom he
had formerly known. He had been a retainer of <persName>Komatsu
Dono</persName>, and his name was <persName>Saitō Takiguchi Tokiyori</persName>, the son of
<persName>Saitō Saemon Mochiyori</persName>. When he was thirteen years of age
he had gone to the Palace to take up his duties, and there he
fell deeply in love with a girl named <persName>Yokobue</persName>, a maid-in-waiting
on the <persName>Imperial Consort Kenrei-mon-in</persName>. When his father heard
of this he remonstrated with him very strongly, for he had
intended that his son should make a good match through
which he might be able to obtain a good position at Court.
Thereupon <persName>Takiguchi</persName> exclaimed: In ancient times in <placeName>China</placeName>
<pb n="196" xml:id="p210-196"/>

there lived one named <persName>Seō-bo</persName> who is alive no longer, and
<persName>Tōbō-saku</persName> also is now but a name and nothing more. Fleeting
are the limits of youth and age; for as a flash of fire they pass
and are gone,
If we speak of long life, it is but seventy or
eighty years, and of these the prime of life is no more than
twenty. So in this world of dreams and illusions why be
burdened with one we dislike, even for a moment? But if I
look on the one I love it is disobedience to my father.
By
this lesson I will learn virtue. I will renounce this passing
world and enter the way of <persName>Buddha</persName>." And at the age of
nineteen he shaved his head and entered the temple of <placeName>Ojo-in</placeName>
in <placeName>Saga</placeName>. When <persName>Yokobue</persName> heard this, she said: "That he
should give me up is quite natural, but why be so foolish as to
become a monk? And if he meant to retire from the world,
why did he not first come and tell me of it? So thinking that
however strong his resolve might be, he might have come and
expressed his regret, she left the city one evening and set off
for <placeName>Saga</placeName> in anxious mood.
</p>
<p>
It was now past the tenth day of the second month, and
the spring breeze of <placeName>Umezu</placeName> wafted her the grateful scent of
many blossoms, while the moon, half-hidden by the drifting mist,
reflected itself dimly in the <placeName>Oigawa</placeName>, but how sad and troubled
was her heart as she searched for her lover. All she had
heard was the name of the temple, but she knew not in what
part of it he was living, and so she wandered about distractedly
hither and thither, trying to find it in great distress. Then she
heard proceeding from a rough and poor cell the voice of
someone reciting the <title>Sutras</title>, and she knew it for the voice of
<persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName>. So she told the maid who was with her
to go and take this message: "Even though you have thus
changed your condition, I, <persName>Yokobue</persName> have come so far to see
you once more." <persName>Takiguchi</persName> was greatly amazed and agitated
to hear this, and peeping through a hole in the shoji, saw her
standing outside, the skirts of her garments soaked with dew,
and her sleeves wet with tears. Her face had grown thinner in
<pb n="197" xml:id="p211-197"/>

the meanwhile, and she looked weary with her search, truly a
sight to melt the heart of the most fanatic devotee. But
<persName>Takeguchi</persName> only sent someone out to say:
"The person
whom you seek is not here. You must have come to the
wrong place." And so there was nothing for <persName>Yokobue</persName> to do
but to swallow her tears and wend her way back to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>,
sad and bitter of heart.
</p>
<p>
By and by <persName>Takiguchi</persName> said to the monk who dwelt with
him: "This is a quiet place, and there is no interruption to
one's prayers, but now that girl knows my whereabouts, and
though once I was able to steel my heart, if she should follow
me again I might melt. Farewell." And he left <placeName>Saga</placeName> and
betook himself to Mount <placeName>Kōya</placeName>, where he entered the temple of
<placeName>Shōjō-shin-in</placeName> to practise the religious life. There after a while
he heard that <persName>Yokobue</persName> too had left the world and become a
nun, and he sent her this stanza:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Till you forsook the world your heart was filled with resentment,</l>
<l>Surely your soul must rejoice, now you have entered the Way."</l>
</lg>
<p>
To this <persName>Yokobue</persName> answered:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Where is the need for regret when once we have entered the cloister?</l>
<l>There is no turning back, when we have entered the Way.".</l>
</lg>
<p>
Afterwards she entered the temple of <placeName>Hokkeji</placeName> at <placeName>Nara</placeName>, but
she was unable to forget the past, and brooded over it until
before long she fell sick and died. When <persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName>
was told of it he redoubled his religious austerities, and his
father forgave his unfilial conduct, so that he became to be
known to all who were acquainted with him as the Saint of
<placeName>Kōya</placeName>. Now when <persName>Koremori</persName> met him after a long while he
remembered him as attired in Hariginu and Tate-eboshi, his
hair carefully dressed and his whole appearance rich and gay,
<pb n="198" xml:id="p212-198"/>

but the man he now beheld was dressed in a priest's robe and
stole of sombre colour, and though he was not yet thirty years
old, he looked like an emaciated old monk. His person exuded
an odour of incense smoke, and his whole demeanour was that
of a sage sunk in profound and pious meditations, so much that
his condition seemed to <persName>Koremori</persName> a most enviable one. Perhaps
the <persName>Seven Sages</persName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName> who dwelt in the <placeName>Bamboo Grove</placeName>, or
the <persName>Four Greybeards</persName> of <placeName>Kan</placeName> who lived in <placeName>Shozan</placeName>, did not look
more venerable than he.

<head>THE BOOK OF KōYA.</head>
<p>When <persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName> saw that it was <persName>Koremori</persName>, he
exclaimed: "Can it be that you are not an illusion? Then
how is it that you have managed to escape from <placeName>Yashima</placeName>?
"When I left the Capital for the <placeName>Western Povinces</placeName>", replied
<persName>Koremori</persName>, "I did not think much of it, but afterwards I could
not rest for a moment for anxiety about those I had left behind
there, and though I said nothing my feelings were apparent, and
both <persName>Munemori</persName> and the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> were uncertain whether
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> would extend to them the indulgence that he had to
<persName>Yorimori</persName> for the sake of <persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName>, and so, unable to bear
the suspense any longer, I was impelled to come thus far. Here
I thought to renounce the world, and yield up my life by fire
or water, but I have a great desire to go to <placeName>Kumano</placeName>." "The
affairs of this world of dreams are of little matter", replied
<persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName>, "but to spend long ages in the hells is
indeed painful.”
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Takiguchi</persName> led him round to pray at all the
monasteries and pagodas, coming at last to the <placeName>Oku-no-in</placeName>. Mount
<placeName>Kōya</placeName> is two hundred ri from the Imperial Capital silent and
far from the habitations of men: untainted are the breezes
that rustle its branches, calm are the shadows of its setting sun.
Eight are its peaks and eight are its valleys, truly a spot to
<pb n="199" xml:id="p213-199"/>

purify the heart: beneath the forest mists the flowers blossom;
the bells echo to the cloud-capped hills. On the tiles of its
roofs the pine-shoots grow; mossy are its walls where the
hoar-frost lingers.
</p>
<p>
In ancient times in the period Enki, in answer to a request
in a dream from <persName>Kōbō Daishi</persName>, the <persName>Mikado Daigo Tennō</persName> sent a
dark coloured robe to <placeName>Kōya</placeName>; but when the Imperial Messenger
<persName>Chūnagon Sukezumi-no-Kyō</persName> ascended the mountain,
accompanied by the <persName>Sōjō Kwangen</persName> of <placeName>Hannyaji</placeName>, and opened the doors of
the holy tomb to put the new robe on the <persName>Daishi</persName>, a thick mist
arose and hid his figure from their eyes. Bursting into tears
<persName>Kwangen</persName> exclaimed: "Why are we not permitted to see
him? This is the .first time since I was born that I have
received such a rebuke." And casting himself on the ground
he wept bitterly. Then the mist gradually melted away, and
the <persName>Daishi</persName> appeared like the moon from the clouds, and
<persName>Kwangen</persName>, weeping now for joy, clothed him in the new
garment and also shaved his hair which had grown very long.
</p>
<p>
Though the Imperial Messenger and the <persName>Sōjō Kwangen</persName>
were able to see and adore the <persName>Daishi</persName>, the <persName>Sōjō's</persName> acolyte,
<persName>Naigu Shunyū</persName> of <placeName>Ishiyama</placeName>, who had accompanied them, was
unable to do so on account of his youth, and was greatly
grieved in consequence, so the <persName>Sōjō</persName> took his hand and placed
it upon the knee of the <persName>Daishi</persName>, and ever after this hand had a
fragrant odour all his life. It is said too that instruction for
making incense of a similar scent is still handed down at the
temple of <placeName>Ishiyama</placeName>. Now this was the reply that the <persName>Daishi</persName>
sent to the <persName>Mikado</persName>: "In former days I met a Sattva, and
from him learned all the secret tradition of <term>Dharani</term> and <term>Mudra</term>.
In everlasting pity for the people of the world I took upon
myself an unparalleled vow, and trusting in the great pity of
<persName>Fugen</persName>, exhibiting in myself perfect tranquillity in these far-off
confines, I wait the coming of <persName>Miroku</persName>." Not otherwise did
<persName>Maha Kas'yapa</persName> retire to the cave in <placeName>Mount Keisoku</placeName> to await
the coming of universal peace. It was on the twenty first day
<pb n="200" xml:id="p214-200"/>

of the third month of the second year of Shō-wa, at the Hour
of the Tiger, that <persName>Kōbō Daishi</persName> entered Nirvana, and that is
now three hundred years ago, so that he has yet five billion six
hundred and seventy million years to wait for the rebirth of
<persName>Miroku</persName> and the salvation of the world.

<head>KOREMORI RENOUNCES THE WORLD.</head>
<p>"I am forever undecided, like the birds on the snowy
peaks of <placeName>India</placeName> that are always crying, "to-day we will build our
nest, or to-morrow"; declared <persName>Koremori</persName>, weeping. Tanned
by the salt breezes, and wasted by continual anxiety, he no
longer looked like his former self, but even now he was far
more comely than most men.
</p>
<p>
That night he returned to the cell of <persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName>,
and there they talked of many things both past and present.
As the night grew on and he watched the deportment of the
<persName>Nyūdō</persName> he perceived that he was indeed as it were polishing the
jewel of Truth on the floor of profound faith, and at the boom
of the bell at the Hour of the Tiger, (4 a.m.) he came to
understand the unreality of this world of illusion. Early the
next morning he called <persName>Chigaku Shōnin</persName> of <placeName>Tozen-in</placeName> and
intimated to him that he wished to become a monk. He also
summoned <persName>Yosöbyoye Shigekage</persName> and <persName>Ishidō Maru</persName>, and
addressed them thus: "As for me I am overwhelmed by unspeakable
anxieties, and my way has become straitened so that I cannot
escape, but whatever may become of me there is no need for
you to throw away your lives. Many others are still living,
so after I have met my fate, do you make haste to the Capital
and help them, both cherishing my wife and children, and
praying for my happier rebirth.” On hearing this the two
were for a while choked by emotion so that they could utter
no word, but by and by <persName>Shigekage</persName> controlled his feelings and
said. "At the time of the rebellion of Heiji my father
</p>
<p><pb n="201" xml:id="p215-201"/>

<persName>Yosozaemon Kageyasu</persName> followed our lord <persName>Shigemori</persName>, and at
<placeName>Nijō Horikawa</placeName> engaged <persName>Kamada Hyōye</persName> and fell by the hand
of <persName>Akugenda</persName>. I also might have done some such deed, but at
that time I was hardly two years old and so remember nothing
of it. When I was seven years old my mother followed my
father, and I was left alone with none to care for me, when
your late father took compassion on me, saying that, as I was
the son of one who had given his life for him, I should always
be brought up in his house; and so, when I was nine years old,
on the same night as you performed <term>Gempuku</term>, I also, to my
great pride, was permitted to bind up my hair. As the
character 'mori' is the sign of your house, your father gave it
to you the fifth generation, and to me he gave the first character
of his name, and called me <persName>Shigekage</persName>, my name before this
being <persName>Matsuo</persName>. And concerning this my youthful name
<persName>Matsuo</persName> also; on the fiftieth day after my birth my father took
me in his arms to our lord, and he said:
"The name of my
house is <persName>Komatsu</persName>, so let him be called <persName>Matsuo</persName> in
commemoration." Indeed my father having died thus was a great blessing
to me, for among the other retainers my equals I was perchance
even too much favoured by our lord. So, when he was dying,
and had already put away all thoughts of the things of this
world, he sent for me and said: "Alas! You regarded me
as your father, and I looked on you as a memento of <persName>Kageyasu</persName>.
At the next appointment of officials I intended to raise you to
be Yukie-no-jō, thus giving you the same rank as your father
bore, but now it is all in vain. But I beg you to be mindful
always to keep on good terms with <persName>Koremori</persName>." And so I
thought it natural to look forward to giving my life for yours
some time or other, and it seems a great shame to me that you
bid me run away and save myself in this fashion. Many may
survive, as you say, but as things now are they will all be
retainers of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. And after you have departed this life,
what pleasure can I have in living longer? And if one lived
for a thousand, or ten thousand years, would not one have to
<pb n="202" xml:id="p216-202"/>

die in the end? I can see no greater wisdom than this." And
so saying he cut off his hair himself, and then received the
tonsure from <persName>Takiguchi</persName>. When <persName>Ishidō Maru</persName> saw this, not to
be outdone, he too cut off his hair. He had been with his
master since he was eight years old, and his gratitude was no
less than that of <persName>Shigekage</persName>, so he also had his head shaved by
<persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName>. When <persName>Koremori</persName> saw what they had done
he felt inexpressibly sad, and excalimed: "Ah! I had
thought to see my dear ones once again in my former state,
but now I have nothing more to hope for." And so, as it
must be, repeating three times the Buddhist text, "<foreign xml:lang="ja">Ryūten
sankai-chu, On-ai-funō-dan, Kion-nyu-mu-i, Shinjitsu hō-onsha</foreign>",
he submitted his head to the tonsure. Both <persName>Koremori</persName> and
<persName>Yosobyōye</persName> were twenty seven years old at this time, while
<persName>Ishidō Maru</persName> was eighteen. By and by he called the <persName>Toneri</persName>
<persName>Takesato</persName> and said: You are not to go up to the Capital.
now. In the end it can not be concealed, but if my wife were
to know what I have done now, no doubt she too would
renounce the world. But go to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> and tell them
that, as they can see, the world is in a sad plight, and those
who are tired of existence are many; perhaps they may not
have heard that <persName>Hidan-no-Chūjō Kiyotsune</persName> fell in the <placeName>Western
Provinces</placeName>, and <persName>Bitchu-no-kami Moromori</persName> was killed at <placeName>Ichi-no-
tani</placeName>, while my chief regret is that they may think me recreant
on account of my present behaviour. Moreover, as to this
armour of Chinese leather, and the sword <persName>Kogarasu Maru</persName>, which
have been handed down as heirlooms from <persName>Taira Sadamori</persName>, and
have come to me after nine generations, in the event of fortune
favouring our house again so that we are able to return to
the Capital, you must take them and give them to my son
<persName>Rokudai</persName>." <persName>Takesato</persName>, overcome by emotion, could make no
reply for some time, but after a while he restrained his feelings
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><foreign xml:lang="ja">Rzuten</foreign>, etc. "Whosoever is continuously reborn in the Three Worlds,
it is because he cannot sever the bonds of affection. Whosoever renounces
affection and enters Nirvana, he it is who in truth requites affection."</note>
<p><pb n="203" xml:id="p217-203"/>

and said: "Not till I have seen what is to befall will I leave
my master, but when all is ended I will go to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>."
Whereat <persName>Koremori</persName> allowed him to go with him. Then, taking
<persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName> with them as a guide to salvation, they set
out from <placeName>Kōya</placeName> in the guise of <term>Yamabushi</term>, and soon arrived
at <placeName>Santō</placeName> in <placeName>Kii</placeName>. After worshipping at the (shrine of <persName>Prince
Fujishiro</persName> and others, before the shrine of <persName>Prince Iwashiro</persName> to
the north of <placeName>Senri-ga-hama</placeName> they met seven or eight horsemen
in <term>kariginu</term>.´ Thinking they might be in danger of being
captured, each of the party laid his hand on his dirk to cut
open his belly, when the others, respectfully dismounting
without any trace of suspicious conduct, made a deep obeisance
and passed on. After this encounter, fearing that they might
meet some others who knew them in these parts, <persName>Koremori</persName> and
his men quickened their steps and hurried on. The horseman
whom they had met was one <persName>Yuasa-no-Shichirōhyōye Mune-
mitsu</persName>, the son of <persName>Yuasa-no-Gon-no-kami Muneshige</persName>, and when
his retainers asked him who it was he replied: "That is
<persName>Sammi Chujō Koremori</persName> the eldest son of <persName>Komatsu-no-Daijin
Shigemori</persName>. He has escaped from <placeName>Yashima</placeName> somehow or other,
and has already shaved his head and become a monk. Those
with him were <persName>Yosobyōye</persName> and <persName>Ishidō Maru</persName>, who have also
renounced the world with him. I would have stopped and
enquired of him how he did, but I thought he would be
embarrassed and so passed on.
How pathetic indeed is his
fate!"
And he pressed his sleeve to his face and wept: and of
his retainers there was none who did not moisten the sleeve of
his <term>kariginu</term>.

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>THE PILGRIMAGE TO KUMANO.</head>
<p>Thus proceeding on their way at length they came to the
<placeName>Iwatagawa</placeName>. And of this river it is said that whosoever crosses
it is cleansed of all evil karma and hindrances to right conduct,
<pb n="204" xml:id="p218-204"/>

and inherited sins. As he offered up his prayers with a calm
mind before the <placeName>Shōjōden</placeName> of the main shrine, and throughout
that night contemplated the bulk of the stately temple, his
heart was filled with thoughts too deep for utterance. A mist
of boundless mercy and protection hovered over the mountain
of <placeName>Yuya</placeName>, and the matchless spiritual power of the deity
manifested itself in the <placeName>Otonashigawa</placeName>. The moon of the
all-embracing efficacy of the doctrine shone clear and without
spot, and no dew of evil thoughts collected in the garden of
repentance for the <term>Six Roots of wickedness</term>. Everything
around spoke to him of help and salvation.
</p>
<p>
As the night grew on and he meditated in the silence, he
pondered sadly over the remembrance of how his father
<persName>Shigemori</persName> had come to this shrine and entreated the deity to
shorten his days and grant him happiness in the after life. And
as the <persName>Gongen</persName> of this shrine is <persName>Amida Nyorai</persName>, he prayed that,
in accordance with his vow to save all mankind, he would
bring him safe to the <placeName>Pure Land</placeName>, and also that his wife and
children in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, might find peace and safety: for even when
one has forsaken the world and entered the True Way, these
blind attactions are not wholly absent.
</p>
<p>
The next day he took ship and went from the <placeName>Hongū</placeName> to
the <placeName>Shingu</placeName> and worshipped the deity there. On its cliffs the
pine trees tower aloft; its breezes sweep all vain thoughts from
the mind; while its clear flowing waters wash away the dust
and mire of this evil world. Worshipping at the shrine of
<placeName>Asukai</placeName>, and passing by <placeName>Sano-no-Matsubara</placeName>, he came to the
shrine of <placeName>Nachi</placeName>. There is the famous three-fold waterfall that
soars up thousands of yards to the sky, where upon the top of
the cliff there stands a figure of <persName>Kwannon</persName>, a spot that might
be called <placeName>Fudaraku-san</placeName>: and as the sound of many voices
chanting the <title>Hokke Sutra</title> came out of the mist it might be
considered like the peak of <placeName>Gridhrakuta</placeName>. So since the time
that the <persName>Gongen</persName> became reincarnate in this mountain all the
people of our country from highest to lowest have come on
<pb n="205" xml:id="p219-205"/>

pilgrimage to bow their heads and pray at this shrine, and
therefrom have received great benefits. Hence are the temple
roofs so many, and the courts crowded with priests and laymen.
In the summer season of the period of Kwan-wa the <persName>Hō-ō
Kwazan</persName>, an Emperor possessing the Ten Virtues, came to pray
for rebirth in the heaven of <persName>Amida</persName>, and on the site of the cell
where he stayed an ancient cherry tree in bloom still recalls
his memory.
</p>
<p>
Now among the priests who were staying at <placeName>Nachi</placeName> there
were many who remembered the <persName>Chūjō Koremori</persName> in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>,
and when some of them asked who was this who had come to
worship, another replied: "This is <persName>Sammi Chūjō Koremori</persName>,
the son of the <persName>Daijin Shigemori</persName>; when he was only Shōshō of
the Fourth Rank, in the spring of the period Angen, there was
a celebration of the fiftieth birthday of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> at the <placeName>Hōjūji-
den</placeName>, and his father <persName>Komatsu Dono</persName>, who was then <persName>Naidaijin-no-Sadaishō</persName>, and his uncle <persName>Munemori</persName>, who was <persName>Dainagon-no-Udaishō</persName>, attended at the Palace. Besides these came also
<persName>Sammi-no-Chujo Tomomori</persName>, <persName>Tō-no-Chūjō Shigehira</persName>, and all the
<persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> of their house, then in the height of their
prosperity, and from among them as they stood by the curtain
of the dancing-stage, advanced this youthful <persName>Shigehira</persName>, crowned
with a wreath of cherry-blossoms, and danced the measure
called <term>Seikaiha</term>. Most gracefully his sleeves floated out on the
breeze, and his mien was brilliant as dew-sprinkled flowers,
brightening the earth and illumining the sky. Then the
<persName>Imperial Consort</persName> sent him a robe of honour as a present by the
hands of the <persName>Kwampaku</persName>, and his father the <persName>Daijin</persName>, leaving his
seat, came forth to receive it, placing it on his left shoulder
while he did obeisance to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>. It was an honour that
few could equal, and his fellow courtiers could not but be
envious; while some of the ladies of the Court in their
admiration compared him to a plum-tree among the trees of
the forest. When we consider how brilliant he then was, ere
long to rise to the high position of Daijin-no-Taishō, who
<pb n="206" xml:id="p220-206"/>

would have thought ever to see him in this sad and emaciated
condition. Though we speak of change and impermanence, it
is a painful thing to see such a thing." And among all the
priests of <placeName>Nachi</placeName> there was none who did not press his sleeve to
his eyes.

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14" xml:id="v10_ch14">
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>KOREMORI DROWNS HIMSELF.</head>
<p>So <persName>Koremori</persName>, after completing the pilgrimage to the three
shrines of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, took a boat before the shrine called
<placeName>Hama-no-miya</placeName>, and launched out to the open sea. There is an
island far out in the offing called <placeName>Yamanari-no-shima</placeName>, and to
this he rowed and disembarked on the shore. Weeping bitterly
he cut his name and pedigree on a great pine tree thus:
"<persName>Sammi-no-Chujo Koremori</persName>, religious name <persName>Jō-en</persName>, son of
<persName>Komatsu-no-Naidaijin Shigemori Kō</persName>, religious name <persName>Jo-ren</persName>,
grandson of the <persName>Dajō-daijin Taira-no-Ason Kiyomori</persName>, religious
name <persName>Jō-kai</persName>, aged twenty-seven years; drowns himself in
the offing of <placeName>Nachi</placeName>, twenty-eighth day of the third month of
the third year of Ju-ei": after which he again entered the
boat and rowed out into the offing.
</p>
<p>
Though he had made up his mind to end his life, when it
came to the point he felt down-cast and sad. As it was the
twenty eighth day of the third month a sea mist was rolling
over the waters, wrapping everything in a dreary pall; but even
on an ordinary spring day a melancholy mood comes over us
with the approach of evening, so how much more when today.
is the end, the last evening we spend on earth. Looking at the
fishing-boats as they rose and sank on the waves, though he
had made up his mind to sink likewise, yet his thoughts dwelt
on his own fate, and when he saw a flock of wild-geese he felt
as great regret and home-sickness for his birthplace as did <persName>Sōbu</persName>
when he was imprisoned in the land of <placeName>Ko</placeName>, and sent back a
message by a wild-goose. Recollecting himself, however, and
<pb n="207" xml:id="p221-207"/>

reproving himself for harbouring such vain thoughts of this
world, he put his hands together, and turning to the west
repeated the <term>Nembutsu</term>. But even so the thought came into
his mind how his dear ones in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> did not know that this
was his last hour, and would keep on waiting and hoping for
some tidings of him, so dropping his hands and ceasing to say
the <term>Nembutsu</term>, he turned to <persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName> and said:
"Ah, what a thing it is to have wife and children! For not,
only are they an anxiety in this world, but a hindrance to
obtaining Enlightenment in the next. I fear that the obtrusion
of these thoughts is because of the greatness of my guilt, and I
repent of it."
</p>
<p>
The sage felt deeply grieved in his heart, but thinking it
would not do to show any weakness, he wiped away his tears
and assumed an impassive expression. "Alas"! he said,
"tender feelings are common to all men, and it is indeed as
you say.
Endless are the karma-relations produced if a man
and woman place their pillows together but for one night, and
deep is the connexion in their after lives. Those that are
born must die; those that meet must part", is the way of this
world. "The last dew or the first drop," one must go before
the other, and whether one dies first or last, all must leave this
world at last. The pledge of <persName>Gensō</persName> to <persName>Yōkihi</persName> on an evening
in autumn at the <placeName>Ri-san Palace</placeName> led but to the bruising of hearts
at last, and even the favour of <persName>Shozen</persName> in the <placeName>Kan-sen-den</placeName> had
to come to an end. Even the magicians <persName>Sho-shi</persName> and <persName>Bai-sei</persName> did
not live for ever, neither are the highest rank of saints free from
birth and death; so that even if you can boast of the pleasures
of long life, this resentment cannot be put away for ever.
Thus if you live for a hundred years; the pain of parting will
still be the same. And <persName>Mara</persName> the king of evil in the sixth
<placeName>Devaloka</placeName>, who opposes the Way, taking possession of the <placeName>Six
Heavens of Desire</placeName>, has made them his own, and grudging the
people of these worlds deliverance from birth and death,
becomes to them wives and husbands to hinder their
escape;
<pb n="208" xml:id="p222-208"/>

and so all the <persName>Buddhas</persName> of the <placeName>Three Worlds</placeName>, regarding all
mankind as their children, in their zeal to bring them to the
<placeName>Paradise of the Pure Land</placeName>, have strictly warned them that from
the utmost antiquity wives and children were fetters to bind
them to the <term>Wheel of Birth and Death</term>. But do not lose heart
on that account, for <persName>Iyo-no-Nyūdō Yoriyoshi</persName>, an ancestor of
the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, being sent by the Imperial Command to subdue
<persName>Ando Sadatō</persName> and <persName>Munetō</persName>, the rebels of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, in the course of
twelve years took the heads of more than sixteen thousand
men, besides which he deprived of life many millions of the
beasts of the field and fish of the rivers, and yet at the time of
his death, as a strong desire for Enlightenment awoke within
him, he is said to have attained a seat in <placeName>Paradise</placeName>. So great is
the merit of forsaking the world that all the sins of previous
lives are washed away: even if one should build a Pagoda of
the Seven Precious Things reaching up to the thirty third
heaven, his merit would not be as great as that of him who
renounces the world for a single day. Or if one should feed a
hundred <persName>Arhats</persName> for a hundred thousand years, he who forsakes
the world for one day would have greater merit. Was not
<persName>Yoriyoshi</persName> able to attain bliss by his strength of mind? So
shall not you, whose guilt is far less, be able to be reborn in
the <placeName>Pure Land</placeName>? And moreover <persName>Amida Nyorai</persName>, the <persName>Gongen</persName>
of this shrine, has made forty eight vows to save mankind, and
among these in the eighteenth vow he states that whosoever in
true faith shall call up to ten times on his name, earnestly
desiring to enter <placeName>Paradise</placeName>, shall in no wise fail to attain
Enlightenment. So if indeed you believe this doctrine, relying
on it in firm faith without any doubt, and if you repeat the
<term>Nembutsu</term> either once or ten times, <persName>Amida Nyorai</persName>, diminishing
to some sixteen feet his august stature, which is of a height that
myriads of Nahutas, many in number as the sands of the <placeName>Ganges</placeName>,
only can measure, with <persName>Kwannon</persName> and <persName>Seishi</persName> and innumerable
Saints and <persName>Bodhisattvas</persName> encompassing them about tier on tier,
will come forth to meet you from the <placeName>Eastern Gate of Paradise</placeName>,
<pb n="209" xml:id="p223-209"/>

welcoming your advent with songs of rejoicing. Thus though
your body may sink to the bottom of this ocean, you will ride
in glory on clouds of purple. And when you have become a
<persName>Buddha</persName> and attained liberation, in true enlightenment you may
come back to this world, and without doubt may lead your
wife and child into the path of true salvation." And as he
spoke thus, striking his bell the while, and urging him to repeat
the <term>Nembutsu</term>, <persName>Koremori</persName>, in sure belief that he had attained
Enlightenment, steadfastly putting aside all vain thoughts, looked
towards the west and clasped his hands, with a loud voice
repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term> a hundred times, and then with the
word "Namu on his lips sprang into the ocean. <persName>Yasōbyōye</persName>
and <persName>Ishidō Maru</persName>, repeating the same invocation, also sprang to
their death with their master.

<head>THE THREE DAY'S HEISHI.</head>
<p>The <persName>Toneri</persName> <persName>Takesato</persName> was also about to follow his master
into the water, when <persName>Takiguchi Nyūdō</persName> prevented him and
said: "However grievous it may be, you must not depart
from your lord's last behest. It is miserable to be left thus
without a master, but you must live on to pray for the soul."
"In my grief at being left behind ", replied <persName>Takesato</persName>, "I had
quite forgotten my obligations." And casting himself down in
the bottom of the boat, he cried and lamented aloud, just as
did <persName>Tchandaka</persName> when he took the horse <persName>Kanthaka</persName> from <persName>S'akya
Muni</persName> at the time of his flight to <placeName>Mount Dantaloka</placeName>, and returned
with it to the palace. For a while they rowed about to see if the
others would reappear or not, but they had sunk deep and came
up no more. As they rowed they repeated the <title>Sutras</title> and the
<term>Nembutsu</term> for their happier rebirth. And so the evening sun
went down in the west, and all the sea grew dark, and though
they could not bear to leave, yet as it must be, they rowed
back the now empty boat to land, tears and oar-drips mingling
<pb n="210" xml:id="p224-210"/>

indistinguishably on the <persName>Nyūdō's</persName> sleeve.¨ <persName>Takiguchi</persName> returned
to <placeName>Kōya</placeName>, and <persName>Takesato</persName> went on weeping to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, where he
delivered his lord's letter to his younger brother <persName>Shin Sammi-no-Chujō Sukemori</persName>. "Alas!" said he when he opened it,
"I had not thought he would act thus. Would that I had
gone too and met my death with him, for it is grievous to die
thus separated. Both <persName>Munemori</persName> and the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> thought
that he was going back to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> by the favour of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>,
and meant to desert us, but now how sad that he has drowned
himself thus in the sea of <placeName>Nachi</placeName>. Did he give you any
message for us besides?" Then the <persName>Toneri</persName> related in detail
all that <persName>Koremori</persName> had told him to say to them, about the
deaths of his brothers and his sorrow at leaving them in this
way, finishing with his request about the armour and sword.
When he had heard it all he pressed his sleeve to his face,
exclaiming : "Now I too have no wish to live any longer."
And all the samurai who stood round, noticing the great
resemblance he bore to the late <persName>Chūjō</persName>, could not forbear from
moistening their sleeves. <persName>Munemori</persName> and the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName> also,
when they heard that he had not entreated the favour of
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> as they had thought, were terribly pained at his
untimely death.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of the fourth month the era was changed
and the subsequent one was called Gen-ryaku. On the same
day an appointment of officials was held, and the former
<persName>Uyōye-no-suke Yorimoto</persName> of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> was raised to the lower
grade of the Upper Fourth Rank from the lower grade of the
Lower Fifth, thus passing over five grades at once. On the
third day the <persName>Emperor Sūtoku-in</persName> was raised to be a god, and a
shrine was dedicated to him at <placeName>Oi-no-Mikado</placeName>, the ancient
battle field of Hogen. This is said to have been done by order
of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> alone, the Imperial Court knowing nothing
about it.
</p>
<p>
On the fourth day of the fifth month <persName>Ike-no-Dainagon
Yorimori</persName> set out for <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, for <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had always been
</p>
<p><pb n="211" xml:id="p225-211"/>

kindly disposed to him, having sworn many times: "I will
treat you with every care and attention, and give you the same
welcome that I would have done to your respected mother
<persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName>; by <persName>Hachiman Daibosatsu</persName> I swear it": but though
he did not doubt that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> himself thought thus, he was
not so sure about the other <persName>Genji</persName>, and had so far hesitated;
but lately a messenger had come from <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, saying:
"Come down hither without delay, for I wish to see you; I
will receive you just as the late <persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName> ;" and so he
started at once. Now among his retainers was one <persName>Yaheibyōye
Munekiyo</persName>, the most faithful of all the hereditary vassals of the
<persName>Heike</persName>, and he would not accompany him on this occasion.
On being asked the reason he replied: "My lord is thus able
to go down in safety, but I cannot rest for thinking of the
others of our house who are tossed about on the waves of the
<placeName>Western Ocean</placeName>; so when I have calmed my mind somewhat I
will follow on afterward." Abashed and pained by this speech
the <persName>Dainagon</persName> replied: "Indeed I felt it hard to be left behind
here when the rest of our family fled, but life is precious and I
was loath to throw it away, so I reluctantly stayed. And now
that I must go down to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, why can you not escort me
on such a long journey? When I stayed behind, why did you
not offer any remonstrance? Was there anything, great or
small, in which I did not consult you?" Shifting his
position, <persName>Munekiyo</persName> replied with a respectful obeisance : "Alas!
Nothing is more dear than life to all men, both high and
low; and so it is said that one will leave the world sooner
than give up his life. I did not think it a bad deed that
you should stay behind here; and it is only because the
life of <persName>Yoritomo</persName> himself was spared that he has reached
his present happy condition. Moreover he has not
forgotten my services in escorting him, at the bidding the late
<persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName>, as far as <placeName>Shinohara</placeName> in <placeName>Ōmi</placeName> at the time of his
exile; and if I accompany you to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> he will certainly
entertain me bountifully and make me presents. Therefore it
<pb n="212" xml:id="p226-212"/>

is that, when I think of my friends and the <persName>Courtiers</persName> of our
house cast upon the waters of the <placeName>Western Sea</placeName>, I feel ashamed
to receive such preference. And as to your going on a long
journey, I indeed feel anxious, and if you were going to attack
the enemy I would not fail to be among the first to go, but in
this case I think it no wrong to refuse." As he ended his
speech it was not easy for him to control his emotion, and all
the other samurai likewise pressed their sleeves to their eyes.
The <persName>Dainagon</persName> also was greatly displeased, but as there was no
help for it now, he soon after started.
</p>
<p>
On the sixteenth day of the same month he reached
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, and <persName>Yoritomo</persName> immediately received him in audience.
When he enquired where <persName>Munekiyo</persName> was, the <persName>Dainagon</persName> answered
that he was sick just then and could not come. "How can
that be?" replied <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, "I was formerly committed to
his charge, and so I feel very grateful to him, and was looking
forward with great pleasure to seeing him again. It is indeed
a pity that he has not come with you." And as he had
already prepared a grant of manors and many presents for him,
he was very disappointed. The lords of the <placeName>Eastern Country</placeName>
also, who had prepared similar presents and striven against each
other to do him honour, also expressed their regret at his
absence.
</p>
<p>
On the ninth day of the sixth month the <persName>Dainagon Yori-
mori</persName> started on his return journey to the Capital, for though
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> pressed him to stay longer, he feared that those
in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> would be anxious about him, and so begged leave
to depart. <persName>Yoritomo</persName> then sent a request to the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> that
<persName>Yorimori</persName> should be confirmed in the possession of all his fiefs
and lands, and that he should hold his office of <persName>Dainagon</persName> as
heretofore. Besides this he presented him with thirty saddled
horses and thi ty unsaddled, and thirty long chests full of gold,
rolls of silk, and dyed stuffs. Moreover besides what <persName>Yoritomo</persName>
gave him the lords of the <placeName>Eastern Country</placeName> vied with each
other in making him presents, so that the horses alone
<pb n="213" xml:id="p227-213"/>

amounted to three hundred. So that <persName>Ike-no-Dainagon Yori-
mori-no-Kyō</persName> not only returned to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> with his head on his
shoulders, but with great store of riches besides.
</p>
<p>
On the same day <persName>Hirata-no-Nyūdō Sadatsugu</persName>, uncle of
<persName>Higo-no-kami Sadayoshi</persName>, headed the troops of <placeName>Iga</placeName> and <placeName>Ise</placeName> and
led them against the province of <placeName>Ōmi</placeName>, but some offshoots of
the <orgName>Genji</orgName> rode out to encounter them, and on the twenty second
day, unable to hold out any longer, the men of <placeName>Iga</placeName> and <placeName>Ise</placeName>
were beaten and routed. Pathetically heroic was the loyal
conduct of these hereditary retainers of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house in
remembering their ancient obligations, but their plan of
campaign was quite beyond their strength. This was what is
called "The three days <persName>Heishi</persName>."

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>FUJITO.</head>
<p>Now when the scanty tidings which the wife, of <persName>Koremori</persName>
had been accustomed to receive from her husband ceased
altogether, for she had always heard from him about once a
month, she continued waiting and hoping, but when the spring
lengthened into summer, and there were rumours that he was
no longer in <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, she became exceedingly anxious and
sent a messenger to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> to enquire. For some time the
messenger did not return, and the summer became autumn,
when, at the end of the seventh month, he came back at last,
and in answer to the question of his mistress told her that
<persName>Koremori</persName> had started from <placeName>Yashima</placeName> at dawn on the fifteenth
day of the third month with <persName>Yosōbyōye</persName> and <persName>Ishidō Maru</persName>, had
proceeded to <placeName>Kōya</placeName> and become a monk, after which he had
made pilgrimage to <placeName>Kumano</placeName> and drowned himself in the offing
of <placeName>Nachi</placeName>, which news he had heard from the <persName>Toneri Takesato</persName>.
On hearing this the lady, confirmed in her worst fears, cast
herself to the ground in an excess of grief, while her young
<pb n="214" xml:id="p228-214"/>

children joined the voices of their lamentation to hers. Then
the lady who was milk-nurse to her young son, controlling her
emotion, spoke thus: "This is truly no matter for weeping.
To be taken alive like <persName>Hon-sammi Chujō Shigehira</persName>, and
exposed to the disgrace of being taken to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and <placeName>Kama-
kura</placeName> is indeed painful, but it ought to be a source of joy in the
midst of your sorrow to know that our master was able to
proceed to <placeName>Kōya</placeName> and renounce the world, and then go to
<placeName>Kumano</placeName>, and after making all proper preparations for the next
life, to put an end to himself in the waves of <placeName>Nachi</placeName>. Now you
must also become a nun and say prayers for the happy
enlightenment of our departed lord. So the lady forthwith
forsook the world and devoted herself to praying for her
deceased husband. But when the news of the death of <persName>Kore-
mori</persName> was reported to <persName>Yoritomo</persName> he was very grieved and said:
"Ah, what a pity he did not throw himself on my mercy; I
would certainly have spared his life, for it was his father <persName>Shige-
mori</persName> alone who, at the request of the late <persName>Ike-no-Zenni</persName>, got my
sentence remitted to banishment, and in remembrance of this
great kindness I will never deal harshly with his children.
Since he had become a monk I would have taken no further
steps with regard to him."
</p>
<p>
Now after the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had crossed over to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, they
heard that a force of many tens of thousands of horsemen had
arrived at the Capital from the <placeName>East Country</placeName> to advance
against them, and moreover that the parties of <persName>Usuki</persName>, <persName>Hetsuki</persName>
and <persName>Matsuura</persName> had banded together and were about to cross
from <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> to attack them. And as these various rumours
came to their ears they could not help being dispirited and
discouraged; and all the Court Ladies, from the Consort
of the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, <persName>Kenreimon-in</persName>, the Mother of the late
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>, and the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> downwards mourned and
lamented together, wondering what fresh evil tidings they would
have to hear, or what new adversities they would have to
meet. And seeing that so many of the <roleName>Nobles</roleName> had been killed
<pb n="215" xml:id="p229-215"/>

and more than half of the best of the retainers also lost at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName> and his brother and the
other men of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> remarked how their strength had
lessened, but still they thought they would be safe trusting to
the mountains and the sea. On the twenty fifth day of the
seventh month the ladies came together saying that it was just
a year since they had left <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, and wondering how soon
the time had passed; and so, bewailing the vicissitudes they
had met, and talking of reminiscences of the past, some gave
way to tears and some to laughter.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty eighth day the ceremony of accession of
the new <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was held. This is said to have been the
first time that an accession ceremony was held without the
Imperial Seal, the Sacred Sword and the Sacred Mirror,
in all the line of eighty two human Emperors who had
reigned until now. On the sixth day of the eighth month.
an appointment of officials was held and the <persName>Tai-Shōgun
Kaba-no-Kwanja Noriyori</persName> was made Mikawa-no-kami, while
<persName>Kurō-no-Kwanja Yoshitsune</persName> was made Saemon-no-Jō.
As
he received appointment to the office of Kebiishi-no-Hangwan
by edict of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, he was afterwards known as <persName>Kurō
Hōgwan</persName>.
</p>
<p>
It was now autumn, and the wind began to blow in the
stalks of the <term>hagi</term>, while the dew hung heavy on its lower
leaves. The resentful hum of the insects, the rustling of
the rice-stalks and the falling of the leaves, all bring sad
thoughts, and the quickly darkening skies of the short
days of autumn always cause gloomy feelings, so we can
well imagine how much more melancholy must those of the
<persName>Heike</persName> have been. In former days they used to divert
themselves with the spring flowers in the Palace gardens, but now
they languished under the autumn moon by the shore of
<placeName>Yashima</placeName>. While they composed verses to the bright moon,
the evenings of <placeName>Miyako</placeName> were ever in their thoughts, and so
they consoled themselves with tears in their eyes. The
<pb n="216" xml:id="p230-216"/>

following verse made by <persName>Sama-no-kami Yukimori</persName> well
expresses their feelings :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Though the Palace is in the place where our</l>
<l>Sovereign is dwelling,</l>
<l>Yet is Miyako still dearer than ever to me."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Meanwhile the Commander-in-Chief <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Nori-
yori</persName> set forth on the twelfth day of the ninth month for the
<placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> to subdue the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. With him also in
command went <persName>Ashikaga-no Kurando Yoshikane</persName>, <persName>Hōjō no-
Koshiro Yoshitoki</persName>, <persName>Sai-in-no-Jikwan Chikayoshi</persName>, and as Com-
manders of the Samurai, <persName>Doi-no-Jiro Sanchira</persName>, his son <persName>Yataro
Tōhira</persName>, <persName>Miura no-suke Yoshizumi</persName>, his son <persName>Heiroku Yoshimura</persName>,
<persName>Hatakeyama-no-Shōji Shigetada</persName>, <persName>Hatakeyama-no-Nagano-no-Saburo Shigekiyo</persName>, <persName>Sahara-no-Jūrō Yoshitsura</persName>, <persName>Wada-no-Kotarō
Yoshimori</persName>, <persName>Sasaki-no-Saburo Moritsuna</persName>, <persName>Tsuchiya-no-Saburō
Munetō</persName>, <persName>Amano-no-Tōnai Tōkage</persName>, <persName>Hiki-no-Tōnai Tomomune</persName>,
<persName>Hiki no-Tōshirō Yoshikazu</persName>, <persName>Yada-no-Shirō Musha Tomoie</persName>,
<persName>Anzei-no-Saburo Akimasu</persName>, <persName>Ogo-no-Saburo Sanehide</persName>, <persName>Nakajō-no-Tōji Ienaga</persName>, <persName>Ippin-bō Shōgen</persName> and <persName>Tosabō Shōshun</persName>. The
force under these leaders numbered about thirty thousand
horsemen, and they rode out of <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and proceeded as far
as <placeName>Murotsu</placeName> in <placeName>Harima</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
On the side of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> the commanders were <persName>Komatsu-
ro-Shin-sammi Chūjō Sukemori</persName>, <persName>Komatsu-no-Shōshō Arimori</persName>
and <persName>Tango-no-Jiju Tadafusa</persName>, while as Commanders of the
Samurai were <persName>Etchū-no-Jirōhyōye Moritsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorōhyōye Tadamitsu</persName> and <persName>Akushichihyōye Kagekiyo</persName>, who
with about five hundred ships of war rowed out as far as
<placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName>. When the <orgName>Genji</orgName> heard this they also left
<placeName>Muro</placeName> and took up their position at <placeName>Fujito</placeName> at <placeName>Nishikawajiri</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Bizen</placeName>. Thus the two armies were only
separated by a distance of twenty-five chō, and though the
<persName>Genji</persName> were eager to attack, as they had no ships they could do
nothing, but had to remain waiting idly where they were. On
the twenty-fifth day at the Hour of the Dragon some of the
<pb n="217" xml:id="p231-217"/>

more impetuous spirits of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> rowed out in small boats
and waved their fans at the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, beckoning to them and
shouting: "Why do you not come over here?" Now while
the warriors of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> were wondering what they could do,
on the evening of the twenty-fifth day <persName>Sasaki-no-Saburo Mori-
tsuna</persName> of <placeName>Ōmi</placeName> sought out a native of the place and presenting
him with a hitatare, a wadded silk robe, a short hakama and a
silver-mounted <term>Sayamaki</term>, asked him if he could show him a
place where it was possible to cross over to the other side of
the sea on horseback. "Though very few of the people about
here know of such a place, I can show you one”, said the
man. “There is a place like the shallows of a river, about
ten chō wide: at the beginning of the month it is to the east,
and at the end of the month it is to the west, and there you
can easily cross over on horseback.” "In that case", said
<persName>Sasaki</persName>, “let us cross over and see.” So both he and the man
stripped naked and crossed over the shallow that the man
pointed out, and indeed it was not very deep. In some places
it was up to the knee or waist, and there were some where they
wet their hair, but they swam the deep parts and waded in the
shallow. "From the south", said the man, “it is shallower
than from the north, but the enemy are lying there with
their bows ready, so it won't do to go any nearer; let us
go back again." So <persName>Sasaki</persName> returned again with the man,
but as he was afraid that he might tell someone about it,
or show them the way, as there was no way of keeping him
quiet otherwise, and he wished to be the only one to know
about it, he stabbed him to death on the spot, cut off his head
and threw it away.
</p>
<p>
On the next day, at the Hour of the Dragon (8 a.m.), the
<persName>Heike</persName> rowed out again and repeated their provocation of the
previous day. Then <persName>Sasaki-no-Saburo Moritsuna</persName> of <placeName>Omi</placeName>,
attired in a hitatare with dyed figures, and a suit of armour
laced with scarlet, riding a pie-bald war-horse accoutred with a
gold-mounted saddle, accompanied only by seven of his family
<pb n="218" xml:id="p232-218"/>

retainers, rode out against them by the way that he had just
learned. When the Commander <persName>Noriyori</persName> perceived this, he
called out to stop him, and <persName>Doi-no-Jiro Sanehira</persName> spurred his
horse on with whip and heel, shouting out: "Ho there!
<persName>Sasaki Dono</persName>, what has taken you that you are so rash? The
General forbids it! Come back at once!" But <persName>Sasaki</persName> rode
on as though he heard nothing, and <persName>Doi</persName>, unable to stay him,
followed on after him and crossed also. In some places the
water was up to the horse's chest, in others up to the edge of
his harness or his girth, and in some parts it reached to the
middle of the saddle, but by swimming in the deep places and
wading in the shallow at length they got over safely. When
<persName>Noriyori</persName> saw this he shouted out: "<persName>Sasaki</persName> has got the
better of us! The water is shallow, after him and cross!"
And so, at his order, the whole army of thirty thousand
men rode into the water crossed over. The <persName>Heike</persName> on
their part, launching all their ships, drew their bows and
shot at them with all their might, but the <orgName>Genji</orgName> paid no
heed, sloping the neck-pieces of their helmets to avoid
the arrows, and grappling the ships with iron rakes and
bill-hooks, shouting and fighting with the utmost fierceness.
All day long the fight raged, and when night came on the
ships of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were out in the offing, while the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
had crossed over to <placeName>Kojima</placeName> and landed there to breathe
their horses.
</p>
<p>
The next day the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had retired again to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>,
and the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, though eager to follow them and renew the
battle, were unable to do so on account of their lack of ships.
From ancient times there have been many warriors who have
crossed over rivers on horseback, but, however it may be
in <placeName>India</placeName> or <placeName>China</placeName> I know not, in our country to cross the
sea on horseback was regarded as a very extraordinary feat.
Therefore the fief of <placeName>Kojima</placeName> in <placeName>Bizen</placeName> was given to <persName>Sasaki</persName>,
and the record of this deed was inscribed in the annals of.
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>.

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>THE ACCESSION FESTIVAL.</head>
<p>On the twenty-eighth day of the same month there was
another appointment of officials at <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, and <persName>Kurō Hōgwan
Yoshitsune</persName> was promoted to be Go-i-no-Jō, being then known
as <persName>Kurō Taiyu-no-Hōgwan</persName>. And so the tenth month began,
and at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> the wind blew strongly so that the waves
rolled up high on the beach, wherefore no army was able to
attack it. Merchants too came but seldom, so there was little
communication with the Capital. The sky was overcast and
hail fell, so that all were gloomy and dispirited. Now as the
<term>Daijõe</term>, or Accession Festival, was to be held in the Capital,
on the third day of the tenth month the new <roleName>Emperor</roleName> went in
procession for the Ceremony of Purification, <persName>Tokudaiji Dono</persName>
acting as <persName>Naiben</persName>. On the occasion of the same ceremony
being performed two years before for the <persName>Emperor Antoku</persName>,
now in <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> <persName>Naidaijin Munemori Kyō</persName> had
officiated, and the stateliness with which he walked behind the
Dragon Banner, and the harmony with which he wore his
robes, the set of his Kammuri with his long sleeves, down to
the skirts of his Hakama, was most magnificent. And what
could have been finer than the dignity of the <persName>Imperial Guard</persName>
of the <persName>Konoe-tsukasa</persName>, under the command of <persName>Sammi-no-Chujō
Tomomori</persName> and <persName>Tō-no-Chūjō Shigehira</persName>, as they manned the
traces of the Imperial Car? On this occasion <persName>Kurō Taiyū-no-Hōgwan Yoshitsune</persName> commanded them, and though by
comparison with <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> he was quite an accomplished
Courtier, yet he was far inferior to the dregs of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.
</p>
<p>
On the eighteenth day the <term>Daijõe</term> Festival was celebrated,
but in form only; for, compared with the periods of <term>Ji-shō</term>
and <term>Yō-wa</term>, when <persName>Takakura Tennō</persName> was on the Throne, the
farmers and people of the present era were so harassed and
destroyed by both the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and <persName>Genji</persName>, that they could
neither sow their seed nor reap their harvest, so how was it
<pb n="220" xml:id="p234-220"/>

possible to celebrate such a great festival in more than a
formal way?
</p>
<p>
Now if the <persName>Tai-Shōgun Noriyori</persName> had continued to
prosecute his attack on the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, he could have easily destroyed
them, but instead of that he remained with his army at
<placeName>Murotsu</placeName> and <placeName>Takasago</placeName>, amusing himself with a lot of
courtesans and harlots that he had got together, and wasting
the resources of the country as well as troubling the people to
no small extent; and though there were many lords of the
<placeName>East Country</placeName> with him, both great and small, as he was in
supreme command they could do nothing. And in this way
the year ended.

<p>On the tenth day of the first month of the second
year of
Gen-ryaku <persName>Kuro Taiyu-no-Hōgwan Yoshitsune</persName> proceeded to the
Palace of the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, and addressed this petition to His Majesty
through <persName>Okura Kyō Yasutsune Ason</persName>: Forsaken by the gods
and renounced by Your Majesty, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have fled from the
Capital and are now fugitives tossed hither and thither on the
waves.
Yet for the space of three years they have remained at
large and unsubdued, and have occupied many provinces, which
is a matter for great regret. Therefore have I sworn that I will
never return to this Capital until I have utterly destroyed them,
even if I have to pursue the to <placeName>Korea</placeName> or <placeName>China</placeName>, or <placeName>Devils' Is-
land</placeName>, even to the uttermost confines of the sea or sky." At this
the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was greatly rejoiced, and replied: "Be sure and
spare no efforts to obtain a decisive victory." Then <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
returned to his quarters and spoke thus to the warriors of the
<placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>: "By virtue of an Imperial Edict of the
<persName>Hō-ō</persName>, and as the representative of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, I am about to start
for the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> to subdue the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, neither will I
desist from attacking them anywhere either by sea or land till
my purpose is accomplished. Therefore if anyone has any
objection, let him now leave us and go back at once to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> the time had passed by swiftly as the
seasons waxed and waned, until it came to be the third year of
their sojourn, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were continually disturbed by the
rumours of a new army setting out against them from the
Capital, and of the coalition of the <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName> leaders to attack
<pb n="222" xml:id="p236-222"/>

them, so that their spirits sank lower and lower, and the <persName>Imperial
Consort</persName> and the <persName>Nii Dono</persName>, and the <persName>Mother of the late Emperor</persName>
and all their Ladies did not cease from their mournful
prognostications of what was likely to happen to them in the future.
"When the rebels of the East and North disregarded the great
obligations they were under to our house, and threw off their
allegiance to follow <persName>Yashinaka</persName> and <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, "said <persName>Shin-Chū-
nagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName>," I thought it quite likely that the
<placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> might do the same, and said that it would
have been better to stay in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and await a decision there.
But my opinion alone did not prevail, and so we fled in this
timid fashion, and the result is that we have come to this pass."
And truly his words were very reasonable.
</p>
<p>
Now on the third day of the second month <persName>Kurō Hōgwan
Yoshitsune</persName> started from <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and proceeded to <placeName>Watanabe</placeName>
and <placeName>Fukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName> to get his ships in order, with the
intention of attacking <placeName>Yashima</placeName> immediately. On the same day
his brother <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Noriyori</persName> left the Capital also, and
he too went to <placeName>Kanzaki</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName> to prepare his ships for a
campaign against the <placeName>Sanyodo</placeName>. On the tenth day of the same
month the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> sent an Imperial Envoy to the shrines of <placeName>Ise</placeName> and
<placeName>Iwashimizu</placeName>, and gave orders that all the chief priests of all
shrines should offer up prayers for the speedy return of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the Three Sacred Treasures to the Capital.
</p>
<p>
On the sixteenth day, just as the ships that had been
prepared at <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> and <placeName>Fukushima</placeName> were about to loose their
hawsers and set sail, a most violent tempest arose, and the ships
were damaged so that they could not put out, so that day was
spent in repairing them. Then the leaders of the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, great and small, came together at <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> and said:
“We have so far had no experience of war at sea, so what shall
we do?"
"I think we ought to have a '<term>Sakaro</term>' fitted on
these ships," put in <persName>Kajiwara</persName>. "A '<term>Sakaro</term> ?' What is that ?"
asked <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. "When you ride a horse," replied <persName>Kajiwara</persName>,
"you can gallop forward or back at your pleasure, because it is
<pb n="223" xml:id="p237-223"/>

quite easy to turn either to the right or the left, but it is a pretty
difficult matter to swing a ship round; so if we fit oars at both
bow and stern, instead of only at the stern as usual, and insert a
rudder in the middle, then we shall be able to turn about easily
just as we like." "What an ill-omened thing to propose at the
beginning of a campaign," exclaimed <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "you know
armies always set out with the intention of never retreating, and
it is only if they meet with a disaster that they retire, so what is
the meaning of these preparations for running away? You lords
may fit a hundred or a thousand pairs of 'backing-oars' or
' turn-back-oars' or whatever you like to call them, to your
ships, but I shall go with no more than the usual number."
"A good general" returned <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, "is one who advances
at the proper time, and retreats at the proper time, thus saving
his own life and destroying the enemy; that is what is called a
good general: but a man of only one idea is called a 'wild-boar-
warrior,' and is not thought much of." "Wild-boar or stag, it's
all one; the best way to conquer in battle is to attack the
enemy's front, and attack again and again." Then the chiefs of
the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, as they did not dare to laugh openly at
<persName>Kajiwara</persName>, showed their feelings in their features, and muttered
under their breath to each other. <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> and <persName>Kajiwara</persName>
were on the point of drawing their weapons on each other that
day, but fortunately the incident was concluded without any
actual quarrel. "Now the ships are repaired and ready," said
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>," let us have a bite and a cup in celebration; and
while this was being done the stores and weapons and horses
were got on board, and all being prepared he gave the order to
set sail. The captains and crews murmured at this, however,
crying out: "We have the wind behind us, it is true, but it is
a little too strong, and the sea will be very rough outside.”
This angered <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> exceedingly. "Do you think I am
going to stop putting to sea for a little wind?" he cried.
" Whether you die on the sea or on land, it is all the result of the
karma of a former life; and if I told you to put out in the teeth
<pb n="224" xml:id="p238-224"/>

of a head-wind you might blame me with some reason, but with
the wind behind us, even if it is a little fresher than usual, not to
put out at a critical time like this. . . . ! Ho! Men-at-arms!
Shoot these fellows if they won't move!" Then <persName>Ise Saburō
Yoshimori</persName>, <persName>Sato Saburo Tsuginobu</persName> and <persName>Satō Shirōhyōye Tada-
nobu</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, <persName>Eda-no-Genzō</persName>, <persName>Kumai-no-Tarō</persName>, <persName>Musashi-bō
Benkei</persName> and others, each equal to a thousand ordinary men, at
once sprang forth. "At our lord's command!" they shouted,
"Off with those ships, or we shoot every one of you!" So
when the captains and sailors saw them running up with their
bows in their hands they cried out : "Whether we drown out
there in the sea or are shot here, it is all the same, so put off!"
And so of the two hundred odd ships five at last got away.
</p>
<p>
These five were, first the <persName>Hogwan's</persName> ship; then <persName>Tajiro-no-Kwanja's</persName>
ship; then that of <persName>Gotobyoye</persName> and his son; then that of the
brothers <persName>Kaneko</persName>, and that of <persName>Yodo-no-Gonai Tadatoshi</persName>, who
held the office of Funa-bugyo, or Marshal of the Ships. The
rest of the ships, whether from fear of <persName>Kajiwara</persName> or the weather,
did not put out. "There's no need to stop for the others,"
said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "at ordinary times the enemy would be afraid
and on the alert, but on a stormy day like this we can land at a
place where he won't be expecting us; thus we can attack him
to advantage. And take care to cover your lights. If the
enemy sees many lights he will take alarm. Follow my ship by
keeping your eye on my head and stern lights." So they sailed
on all night, and in six hours covered a distance that usually
took three days. It was about two o'clock in the morning on
the sixteenth day of the second month that they set sail from
<placeName>Watanabe</placeName> and <placeName>Fukushima</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, and they arrived off the
coast of <placeName>Awa</placeName> the next morning about seven.

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT KATSUURA.</head>
<p>As it grew light they saw several of the red banners of the
<persName>Heike</persName> fluttering in the breeze. "Now listen," said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>,
the best way we can proceed is this. If we disembark our
horses when we are close to the shore we shall only be a mark
for the enemy's arrows, so while we are still at some distance,
heel the ships and put the horses overboard and let them swim
tethered to the ships. As soon as their feet touch ground and
the water is shallow enough to ride, get into the saddle and
gallop to shore." Though five ships had stores and weapons on
board, they had also found room for fifty horses. So,
according to the <persName>Hogwan's</persName> orders they put the horses overboard
when they were some little distance from the shore, and when
the water was shallow enough they sprang on to their backs,
and as <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> rode up on to the shore at the head of his
fifty horsemen with loud shouts of triumph, a band of some
hundred horse of the enemy, who were waiting on the shore,
did not stay to meet their onset, but retired about two cho
inland.
</p>
<p>
Then, when his men and horses had rested a while on the
shore to get their breath, <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> said to <persName>Ise Saburo Yoshi-
mori</persName> : "There is one of those horsemen who looks important.
Go and fetch him here, for I have some things I want to ask
him." In obedience to the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> command <persName>Yoshimori</persName> rode
off alone into the midst of the hundred horsemen of the enemy,
and what he said I know not, but he soon came back bringing
with him as his prisoner a man of about forty, clad in armour
laced with black leather, who had removed his helmet and
loosened his bowstring in submission. "Who are you?" asked
the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, to which the warrior replied: "<persName>Hanzai-no-Kondo
Roku Chikaie</persName> of this province." "Well, whoever he may be
keep your eye on him, men, and don't let him take off his
<pb n="226" xml:id="p240-226"/>

armour, for he will be a good guide to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>; if he tries to
run away, shoot him." Then, addressing <persName>Kondo Roku</persName> he
asked him the name of the place where they were. "It is called
<placeName>Katsuura</placeName>," he replied. “Oh, no flattery;" said the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>,
laughing. "It is certainly called <placeName>Katsuura</placeName>," declared the
warrior, "the servants may pronounce it in their dialect as
'<placeName>Katsura</placeName>,' but it is written with the two characters, Katsu,'
(victory) and Ura,' (shore)." <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> was highly delighted
at this good omen. "Listen to that, my lords," he cried. "Is it
not lucky that when I start on a campaign I should land at
<placeName>Katsuura</placeName>? And now are there any of the supporters of the
<persName>Heike</persName> round here?" "There is <persName>Sakurama-no-suke Yoshito</persName>,
the younger brother of <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName>," replied
<persName>Kondō</persName>. 'Well, then let us go and kick him out of our way."
And taking the best thirty of the men and horses of the hundred
men of <persName>Kondō's</persName> band, he added them to his own force and rode
off to attack <persName>Yoshito's</persName> castle. When they arrived in front of
this fortress they found that it had a swamp on three sides and a
mcat on the other. Shouting their war-cry, they made a
vigorous attack on the moat side, whereupon the soldiers within
shot at them as fast as they could draw their bows; but the
<persName>Genji</persName> paid no heed to them, pushing on across the moat with
their neck-plates sloped to ward off the shafts, and attacking with
loud shouts, so that <persName>Yoshitō</persName>, thinking further resistance of no
avail, after leaving his retainers behind to hold out as long as
they could, jumped upon a fleet horse that he had, and was
fortunate enough to be able to make his escape. The <persName>Genji</persName> took
the heads of some twenty of the defenders who were thus left
behind, after which they held a celebration in honour of the God
of War, cheering loudly in their joy at such an auspicious
inauguration of their campaign.

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>THE CROSSING OF OSAKA.</head>
<p><persName>Yoshitsune</persName> next asked <persName>Kondo Roku</persName> how many men the
<persName>Heike</persName> had at <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, to which he replied that the number was
not more than a thousand horsemen. How is it that there are
so few?" said the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>. "Because they have stationed
bands of fifty or a hundred men at every creek and island round
<placeName>Shikoku</placeName>, and also because an army of three thousand horse
under the command of <persName>Dennai Saemon Noriyoshi</persName>, the eldest
son of <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName>, has gone over to <placeName>Iyo</placeName> to
attack <persName>Kōno Shiro</persName> of that province, because he would not join
them when they summoned him.” Ah, that's a fine
opportunity! I have them. And how far is it to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> from
here?" About two days march," replied <persName>Kondō</persName>. "Then
let us hurry up and get there before they get wind of us." And
so they started off, sometimes running and sometimes marching,
making as great a speed as they could, until by night they came
to the mountain pass of <placeName>Osaka</placeName> on the borders of <placeName>Awa</placeName> and
<placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, and began to cross it.
</p>
<p>
About the middle of the night as they were pushing on
over the mountain, they came up with a man carrying a letter.
As it was dark he had not the least idea that they were enemies,
but thought they were <persName>Heike</persName> soldiers going to <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, and
began to talk to them quite freely. "You seem to be going to
<placeName>Yashima</placeName>, so I suppose you know the way," said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>.
"Can you guide us?" Certainly," replied the man, "I often
go there, so I know the road very well." Who is that letter
from, and who is it for?" asked <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. "It is from the
Ladies in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, and I am taking it to the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> in
<placeName>Yashima</placeName>," was the reply. "What is it about?”
"The <persName>Genji</persName>
have already got as far as <placeName>Yodo</placeName> and <placeName>Kawajiri</placeName>, so no doubt it is
to send him tidings of it." "Ah, no doubt that is so," exclaimed
the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>," seize that letter, men!" But don't kill him,"
<pb n="228" xml:id="p242-228"/>

he added as they took the letter, "for that would be a useless
crime." So they bound the man to a tree in the mountains and
passed on. When <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> opened the letter and read it, he
found that it was indeed from the Ladies in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>. "<persName>Kuro</persName> is
a shrewd fellow," he read, "and will not fear to attack however
rough the weather may be, so take care not to scatter your
force, and be very much on the alert." "This letter is
godsend to me," said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "we must keep it and show it to
<persName>Yoritomo</persName>." And he stowed it away very carefully.
</p>
<p>
On the following day, the eighteenth, at the Hour of the
Tiger (4 a.m.), they came to a place called <placeName>Hikida</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, and rested there to give breathing-space to the
men and horses. Thence, passing through <placeName>Shiratori</placeName> and <placeName>Nibu-
noya</placeName>, they arrived before the fortress of <placeName>Yashima</placeName>.
Calling
<persName>Kondo Chikaie</persName> once more, the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> enquired:
"What
sort of a road is it from here to the Palace of <placeName>Yashima</placeName> ?" " Ah,
you may well ask, but it is really quite shallow," he replied,
"at low tide the water between the mainland and the island is
not up to a horse's belly." "Then we must attack before they
know we are here," said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>; and setting fire to the
houses of <placeName>Takamatsu</placeName>, they began their attack on the castle of
<placeName>Yashima</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> <persName>Dennai Saemon Noriyoshi</persName>, the eldest son
of <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName>, had ridden into the province of
<placeName>Iyo</placeName> with three thousand horse to chastise <persName>Kono-no-Shiro</persName> for not
coming to join them when he was summoned, but <persName>Kono</persName> himself
had escaped him, so he cut off the heads of some hundred and
fifty of his retainers and marched back with them to the Palace.
But as he thought it was not proper to bring the heads of rebels
to the Palace for inspection, he took them to the headquarters
of the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>, when suddenly his men
began to shout
out that the houses of <placeName>Takamatsu</placeName> were on fire.
"As it is
daytime it is not likely to be accidental," he cried.
"It must be the
enemy who is here, and has set them on fire.
They are sure to
be in great force, so we can do nothing. Come! Come! Into
<pb n="229" xml:id="p243-229"/>

the boats!"
And in great hurry and confusion they scrambled
aboard the ships that were moored in rows along the beach in
front of the main gate. In the Imperial Ship were the <persName>Imperial
Consort Kenreimon-in</persName>, the <persName>mother of the late Emperor</persName> and the
<persName>Nii Dono</persName> with their <persName>Ladies-in-waiting</persName>, while the <persName>Daijin Mune-
mori</persName> was in another with his son, and the others got on board
any ship they could find, and all the ships immediately rowed
out a cho or thirty or forty yards from the shore. Scarcely
had they done so when the seventy or eighty horsemen of the
<persName>Genji</persName>, all armed alike, galloped smartly up to the beach in front
of the main gate.
</p>
<p>
As the tide was at its lowest ebb in the tidal
bay, the water came up to the horse' chests, or knees, or girths
in some places, and in others it was shallower still, and so as they
dashed through the waves, kicking up a mist of foam and apray
all round them, out of which their white banners appeared
fluttering here and there, it was no wonder that the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, doomed
as they were, should imagine that a great army was upon them.
Especially was this so in that the <roleName>Hogwan</roleName>, not wishing that the
enemy should see the smallness of his force, had divided it up
into small groups of from five to ten horsemen each. The
<persName>Hōgwan</persName> was attired that day in a hitatare of red, and armour
of shaded purple, and wore a helmet surmounted by golden
horns, a gold-mounted tachi, and a quiver of black and white
feathered arrows, twenty four in number. Grasping his
rattanbound bow in the middle he glared fiercely at the enemy out in
the offing, and shouted with a loud voice : "I am <persName>Kebiishi
Go-i-no-Jō Minamoto Yoshitsune</persName>, Envoy of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>." After
him the rest of the leaders of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> proclaimed their names
and titles: <persName>Tajiro-no-Kwanja Nobutsuna</persName> of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, <persName>Kaneko-no-Jūrō
Ietada</persName> of <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, <persName>Kaneko Goichi Chikanori</persName>, <persName>Ise-no-Saburō
Yoshimori</persName>, <persName>Gotōbyōye Sanemoto</persName>, <persName>Gotō Shinbyōye-no-Jō Moto-
kiyo</persName>, <persName>Satō Saburōhyōye Tsuginobu</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, <persName>Satō Shirōhyōye
Tadanobu</persName>, <persName>Eda-no-Genzō</persName>, <persName>Kumai-no-Tarō</persName>, and <persName>Musashi-bō
Benkei</persName>, all of them worth a thousand men. As they came riding
up, shouting their war-cries, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> seized their bows and
<pb n="230" xml:id="p244-230"/>

began to shoot from far and near, but the <orgName>Genji</orgName> took but little
heed of them, ducking to left and right to avoid the shafts, and
taking the opportunity to rest and breathe their horses under
the lee of those ships that were in shallow water, all the while
shouting and fighting furiously.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4" xml:id="v11_ch4">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>THE DEATH OF TSUGINOBU.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Gotōbyōye Sánemoto</persName>, a veteran warrior, did not
stop to take part in the fight on the beach, but went on and
burst into the Palace and set it on fire, so that it went up in
flames in a moment. The <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>, seeing this, turned
to his retainers and enquired: "How many men have the
<persName>Genji</persName> ?" "Not more than seventy or eighty horsemen, it
seems," was the reply. "Ah, so few?" exclaimed <persName>Mune-
mori</persName> ;
if the hair of their heads was counted one by one,
they would not equal our force! Why did you lose your
heads and run away to the ships, and let them through without
a blow to set fire to the Palace? Is not <persName>Noto Dono</persName> here?
Let him land and give battle to these fellows!"
At this order
<persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> landed with some five hundred men
in small boats, under the command of <persName>Etchū-no-Jirōhy ōye
Moritsugu</persName>, and took up a position on the beach in front of the
burnt-out main gate. The <persName>Hōgwan</persName> also drew up his eighty
horsemen opposite them, about a bowshot away. Then
<persName>Etchu-no-Jiröhyōye</persName> came forth on to the deck-house of his
boat and shouted in a loud voice: Ho, there! You may
perhaps have declared your name and titles once already,
but as it was far away over the sea, we could not hear. So
who is the leader of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> with whom we have to do
to-day?" "It is needless to repeat it," shouted <persName>Ise Saburō</persName>
in reply, "but here is the <persName>Taiyu Hōgwan Dono</persName>, the younger
brother of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, lord of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, descended in the
tenth generation from <persName>Seiwa Tenno</persName>!" "Oh!" retorted
<pb n="231" xml:id="p245-231"/>

<persName>Moritsugu</persName>," then that is the wretched little stripling, who
was left an orphan when his father was killed in the Heiji
fighting, and who became an acolyte at <placeName>Kurama</placeName> temple, and
ran away to <placeName>Mutsu</placeName> carrying baggage in the train of a gold
merchant." "Why show off your eloquence in such talk
about our lord," replied <persName>Yoshimori</persName>, drawing nearer, "I fancy
you are one of those who got yourself well beaten at <placeName>Tonami-
yama</placeName> in the North, and just escaped with your life, to beg
your way home all the way from the <placeName>Hokurikudo</placeName>, aren't
you?" "What need to be a beggar when one has a bounteous
lord to depend on?" said <persName>Moritsugu</persName>, "I didn't get my living
and keep my family on robbing and thieving in <placeName>Suzugayama</placeName> in
<placeName>Ise</placeName>, and being a low retainer, as you did." At this point
<persName>Kaneko-no-Jūrō</persName> came forward and interrupted them. "What's
the good of all this useless talk? Calling one another names is
a thing anyone can do. These lords know what our young
warriors of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> and <placeName>Sagami</placeName> can. do from what they saw
at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> last spring." And as he spoke his younger
brother, who had so far stood by his side without a word, took
an arrow twelve handbreadths and three fingers long, fitted it to
his bow and drew with all his might, so that the arrow flew
straight at <persName>Moritsugu</persName> and stuck in his breastplate with such
force as if to pierce it right through, thus putting an end to the
wordy warfare.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> was attired as for a sea-fight
without hitatare and full armour, but in a short under-robe
dyed in variegated colours, and armour laced with Chinese
silk. His sword was mounted in gold and silver, and he
carried a Shigeto' bow and a quiver of twenty four arrows
feathered with hawk's tail-feathers. He was the most
redoubtable archer in the Imperial Camp and it was said of him
that he never missed anyone he aimed at. With the intention
of putting an end to <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> at a single shot he stood
watching his mark, but the <orgName>Genji</orgName> perceived this, and <persName>Ise
Saburō</persName>, <persName>Satō Saburōhyōye Tsuginobu</persName>, <persName>Satō Shirōhyōye</persName>
<pb n="232" xml:id="p246-232"/>

<persName>Tadanobu</persName>, <persName>Eda-no-Genzō</persName>, <persName>Kumai Tarō</persName> and <persName>Musashi-bō Benkei</persName>
rode up in a line close together in front of the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> to
protect him from the arrows, so that it was impossible for
<persName>Noto-no-kami</persName> to hit him. "Get out of the way of the arrows,
you fellows!" he shouted, and drawing his bow again and
again with great speed and accuracy he shot down ten of the
<persName>Genji</persName> soldiers, among whom <persName>Satō Saburōhyōye</persName>, who was in
the forefront, received an arrow that pierced him through from
the left shoulder to the right armpit, and no longer able to
sit his horse, fell headlong to the ground. Then one of <persName>Noto-no-kami's</persName> young men named <persName>Kikuo Maru</persName>, a very strong
fighter, wearing a body armour of green colour and a helmet
of three plates, drew his sword and ran out to take the head
of <persName>Tsuginobu</persName>. At this his younger brother <persName>Tadanobu</persName>, who
was standing beside him, drew his bow and shot <persName>Kikuō Maru</persName>
under the skirts of his armour, so that he sank down on to
his knees. When <persName>Noto Dono</persName> saw this, still holding his bow
in his left hand, with his right he seized <persName>Kikuō Maru</persName> and flung
him back into his own ship. Thus he prevented the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
from taking his head, though he died later from the wound.
This youth had formerly been the page of <persName>Echizen-no-Sammi
Michimori</persName>, but after his death he had followed his younger
brother <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName>. His age was then eighteen years, and
<persName>Noto Dono</persName> was so grieved at his death that he fought no more
that day.
</p>
<p>
Then the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, ordering them to carry <persName>Tsuginobu</persName> to
the rear, sprang down from his horse and took him by the
hand, saying: "How do you feel, <persName>Saburōhyōye</persName>?" "It is the
end, my lord," answered <persName>Tsuginobu</persName>. "Is there anything you
would wish for in this world? enquired <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. “What is
there that I should want? Only that I regret that I shall not
live to see my lord come to his own. For the rest, it is the
destiny of one who wields the bow and arrow to fall by the
shaft of an enemy.
And that it should be told to future
generations that I, <persName>Satō Saburohyōye Tsuginobu</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, died
<pb n="233" xml:id="p247-233"/>

instead of my lord at the fight on the beach of <placeName>Yashima</placeName> in
<placeName>Sanuki</placeName>, in the war of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and <persName>Heike</persName>, will be my pride
in this life and something to remember on the dark road of
death." And so he died. Stout warrior as <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> was, he
was so overcome with grief that he pressed the sleeve of his
armour to his face and wept bitterly. He then asked if there
was any reverend priest in those parts, and when they had
found one he said: "A wounded man has just died; I wish
you to recite the <title>Sutras</title> for him for one day," and he presented
him with a stout black horse with a fine set of trappings. This
was the horse that the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, when he received the Fifth
Rank, also raised to the Fifth Rank and gave the name of
<persName>Taiyū Kurō</persName>. It was, the one on which he had descended the
<placeName>Hiyodori-goe</placeName> pass behind <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>. When the other
samurai, and especially <persName>Tsuginobu's</persName> younger brother <persName>Tadanobu</persName>,
saw this, they were moved to tears and exclaimed: "For the
sake of a lord like this, who would consider his life more than
dust or dew?"

<p>Now as those warriors of <placeName>Awa</placeName> and <placeName>Sanuki</placeName> who wished to
throw off their allegiance to the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and join the <orgName>Genji</orgName> began
to emerge from their caves and mountains in small bands
of fifteen and twenty, and ride in to join him, the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> soon
found himself in command of a force of some three hundred
horse.
</p>
<p>
By this time the sun was sinking and both armies were
preparing to retire, as no decision could be reached that day,
when from the offing a small boat, with no special decoration,
was seen to come rowing to the shore. When it had reached
a distance of seven or eight 'tan' from the water's edge, it
swung round broadside on, and while the <orgName>Heike</orgName> wondered
what it would do, a girl, some eighteen or nineteen years
<pb n="234" xml:id="p248-234"/>

old, wearing a five-fold robe of white lined with green, and
a scarlet hakama, took a red fan with a rising sun on it and
hung it up on a pole fastened to the gunwale of the boat.
</p>

<note type="gloss" place="bottom">Seven or eight tan. A tan said to be usually 60 ken (1 ken=6 feet) so it.
would be about 450 feet, which the commentator considers too far. In these
ancient war chronicles a tan is reckoned as one jo or ten feet, but this is too little.
But to hit the rivet of a fan at seventy feet would not be easy, and the shorter
distance seems more likely.</note>
<p>
Calling <persName>Gotōbyōye Sanemoto</persName>, the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> asked him what
was the meaning of it. "It is to shoot at, no doubt," replied
<persName>Gotō</persName>, "I expect it is a plan of theirs to get you to come and
look at this <term>charmer</term>, and entice you out in front into bowshot
and shoot you; but at any rate we ought to shoot it away.”
"Who is the best archer we have?" asked the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>.
"There are several good shots, but the best is <persName>Yoichi Munetaka</persName>,
the son of <persName>Nasu-no-Tarō Suketaka</persName> of <placeName>Shimozuke</placeName>. He is a
small man, but a most skilful archer."
"What proof have
you?" asked <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. He can shoot two or three birds
on the wing with anybody." "Then call him," said the
<persName>Hōgwan</persName>.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Yoichi</persName> was then barely twenty years old. He was wearing
a hitatare of greenish blue with the collar and edges of the
sleeves ornamented with brocade on a red ground. His armour
was laced with light green and the mounts of his sword were
of silver. He carried twenty four arrows with black and white
feathers, or rather dark-grey, in which hawks' wing feathers
were mixed. A turnip-headed arrow pointed with staghorn
was also stuck in his quiver. Carrying his <term>Shigeto</term> bow under
his arm, and with his helmet slung to his breastplate, he came
into the presence of the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> and did obeisance.
</p>
<p>
"How now, <persName>Yoichi</persName>," said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "can you hit that
fan right in the middle, and show the enemy how we can
<pb n="235" xml:id="p249-235"/>

shoot?"
I cannot say that I can for centain," replied <persName>Yoichi</persName>,
"and if I should miss, it would be a lasting reproach to the skill
of our side. So it would be better to entrust it to someone who
could be quite sure." This reply greatly angered <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>.
"Those who came from <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> with me on this campaign
must obey my orders," he exclaimed, "those who do not had
better go back there again!" Then <persName>Yoichi</persName>, thinking it would
not do to refuse again, replied: "I may not succeed in hitting
it, but as my lord commands, I will try." And retiring he
mounted a fine black horse with saddle ornamented with gold,
and taking a fresh hold on his bow, he gripped the reins and
rode into the sea. Those on his own side, looking after him,
exclaimed: Ah, that young fellow is sure to bring it down!
And the <roleName>Hogwan</roleName> also thought he had not misplaced his trust.
As it was a little beyond bowshot he rode about one <term>tan</term> into
the water, but still the fan seemed about seven <term>tan</term> away. It
was the eighteenth day of the second month, and the Hour of
the Cock (6 p.m.). The wind was blowing rather strongly
from the North, and the waves were running high on the beach.
Out in the offing the ships were rising and falling as they rode
on the swell, and the fan was fluttering about in the breeze.
The <persName>Heike</persName> had ranged their ships in a long line to see better
what would befall, while on land the <orgName>Genji</orgName> lined the shore in
expectation. The whole of both armies were watching the
scene.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Yoichi</persName> closed his eyes and prayed: "<persName>Namu Hachi-
man Daibosatsu</persName>, and especially the deities of my homeland, the
<persName>Gongen</persName> of <placeName>Nikko</placeName>, <persName>Yuzen Daimyōjin</persName> of <placeName>Nasu</placeName> of <placeName>Utsunomiya</placeName>, I
pray you grant that I may strike the centre of that fan. For if
I fail, I will break my bow and put an end to my life, showing
my face no more among men. If therefore you will that I see
home again, let not this arrow miss its mark." After praying
thus silently he again opened his eyes, and the wind had abated
a little so that the fan looked easier to hit. Taking a <term>Kaburaya</term>
he drew his bow with all his strength and let fly. He was short
<pb n="236" xml:id="p250-236"/>

of stature, it is true, but his arrow measured twelve handbreadths
and three fingers, and his bow was a strong one.
The shore
echoed to the whirr of the arrow as it flew straight to its mark.
Whizzing it struck the fan an inch from the rivet, so that it flew
up into the air as the arrow fell into the sea. Once and again
the spring breeze caught it and tossed it up, then suddenly it
dropped down into the water. And when they saw the scarlet
fan gleaming in the rays of the setting sun as it danced up and
down, rising and falling on the white crests of the waves, the
<persName>Heike</persName> in the offing beat applaudingly on the gunwales of their
ships, while the <orgName>Genji</orgName> on the shore rattled their quivers till they
rang again.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6" xml:id="v11_ch6">
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>THE DROPPED Bow.</head>
<p>Unable to restrain himself in his excitement over the
enjoyment of this feat, an old warrior of some fifty years of age,
in armour laced with black leather, sprang up on one of the
ships just in the place where the fan had been and began to
dance, twirling a white-handled halberd in his hand.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this, <persName>Ise Saburo Yoshimori</persName> came up behind <persName>Yoichi</persName>
and said: "It is our lord's command that you bring down that
fellow too." So <persName>Yoichi</persName> took one of the middle arrows of his
quiver, drew his bow and let fly. The arrow flew straight to
the mark, hitting the dancer right in the middle of his body so
that he fell back into the bottom of the boat. There were some
who applauded this shot also, but most showed their disapproval
by shouting "Too bad! Too bad! That was a cruel thing
to do." Silence now ensued on the side of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, though
the <orgName>Genji</orgName> still continued to rattle their quivers.
</p>
<p>
Then from the <orgName>Heike</orgName> side, still disinclined to rest under
their discomfiture, there came three warriors, one armed with a
bow, the second carrying a shield, and the third a halberd.
Springing on shore they dared the <orgName>Genji</orgName> to come on, whereat
<pb n="237" xml:id="p251-237"/>

the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> called out to know who of the younger of his best
horsemen would try conclusions with these insolent fellows.
Then there rode forth <persName>Mionoya Jūrō</persName> or <placeName>Musashi</placeName>, and his two
brothers <persName>Shirō</persName> and <persName>Tōshichi</persName>, <persName>Nibu-no-Shirō</persName> of <placeName>Kōzuke</placeName> and
<persName>Kiso-no-Chuji</persName> of <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, five warriors in all. As they charged
forward shouting to the onset, however, the archer behind the
shield loosed a great lacquered shaft, feathered with black
wing-feathers, which pierced the horse of <persName>Mionoya Jūrō</persName> in the
left breast right up to the notch, so that it collapsed like an
overturned screen. The rider at once threw his left leg over the
animal and vaulted down to the right, drawing his sword to
continue the fight, but when he saw the warrior behind the
shield come to meet him flourishing a huge halberd, he knew
that his own small sword would be useless, and blew on a conch
and retreated. The other immediately followed him, and it
looked as though he would cut him down with the halberd, but
instead of doing so, gripping the halberd under his left arm,
tried to seize <persName>Mionoya-no-Jūrō</persName> by the neckpiece of his helmet
with his right. Three times <persName>Mionoya</persName> eluded his grasp, but at
the fourth attempt his opponent held on. For a moment he
could do nothing, but then, giving a sudden violent wrench, the
neckpiece parted where it joined the helmet, and <persName>Mionoya</persName>
escaped and hid behind his four companions to recover his
breath. The other four, wishing to spare their horses, had
taken no part in the combat, but stayed a short way off looking
on. The <persName>Heike</persName> warrior on his part did not follow him any
further, but sticking the neckpiece on the end of his halberd,
shouted out in a loud voice: "Let those afar off listen; those
who are near can see. That's the way we fellows of the
Capital declare ourselves. I am <persName>Akushichibyōye Kagekiyo</persName> of
<placeName>Kazusa</placeName>!" And having thus delivered himself he retired again
behind the shield.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Heike</persName>, encouraged at this, cried out: "Don't let
<persName>Akushichibyōye</persName> be killed! To the rescue of <persName>Kagekiyo</persName>!
Come on, men!" And some two hundred of them hastened to
<pb n="238" xml:id="p252-238"/>

land and set up their shields in a row in hen's wing style, defying
the <orgName>Genji</orgName> to came on. The <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, incensed at this, with
<persName>Tajiro-no-Kwanja</persName> in front, <persName>Ise Saburō</persName> behind, and <persName>Gotōbyōye</persName>
father and son and the brothers <persName>Kaneko</persName> on his left and right
hand, put himself at the head of eighty horsemen and charged
down on them shouting, whereupon the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, who were
mostly on foot and few mounted, thinking they could not stand
against horsemen, quickly retired and re-entered their boats,
leaving their shields kicked about here and there like the sticks
of a fortune-teller.
</p>
<p>
Elated with victory, the <orgName>Genji</orgName> rode into the sea in pursuit
till they were up to their saddles in water and fought among
the ships, while the <orgName>Heike</orgName> with rakes and billhooks tried to seize
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> by the neckpiece of his helmet. Two or three
times their weapons rattled about his head, but his companions
with sword and halberd warded off the attacks from their
master as they fought. In the course of this fighting the
<persName>Hōgwan</persName> somehow or other dropped his bow into the sea, and
leant out of the saddle trying to pick it up again with his
whip. His companions cried out to him to let it go, but he
would not, and at last managed to recover it, and rode back
laughing to the beach. The older warriors reproached him
for this saying: "However valuable a bow it might be, what
is that in comparison with our lord's life?" "It was not that
I grudged the bow," replied <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "and if my bow
were one that required two or three men to bend it, like that
of my uncle <persName>Tametomo</persName>, they would be quite welcome to
it, but I should not like a weak one like mine to fall into the
hands of the enemy for them to laugh at it and say, “This is
the bow of <persName>Kurō Yoshitsune</persName>, the Commander-in-Chief of the
<persName>Genji</persName>; and so it was that I risked my life to get it back."
And this explanation drew expressions of approval from all.
</p>
<p>
When the night fell after the day's fighting the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
were still cruising about off the shore, while the <orgName>Genji</orgName> made
their way inland and took up a position on some high ground
<pb n="239" xml:id="p253-239"/>

by <placeName>Mure-Takamatsu</placeName>. For three nights they had had no sleep,
for the night before last they had been at sea and the weather
was too rough even for a doze, while last night they had been
crossing over the pass after the fight at <placeName>Katsuura</placeName> in <placeName>Awa</placeName>, so
after fighting all of this day both men and horses were tired
out, and fell asleep where they were, caring for nothing,
pillowing their heads on their helmets or quivers or the sleeves of
their armour. But the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> and <persName>Ise Saburō</persName> did not sleep.
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> went up to a high place from which he could
see if the enemy approached, while <persName>Ise Saburo</persName> concealed
himself in a little hollow and lay in wait, so that if an enemy
horseman should come near he could shoot his horse in the
belly. The <persName>Heike</persName> had made preparations for an attack that
night, under the command of <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName>, but as
<persName>Etchu-no-Jirōhyōye</persName> and <persName>Emi-no-Jiro</persName> could not agree as to
which of the two should lead it, the morning broke without
anything being done. If they had made one, how could the
<persName>Genji</persName> have sustained it? And that they did not make it sealed
their fate.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7" xml:id="v11_ch7">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT SHIDO.</head>
<p>When the dawn broke the <orgName>Heike</orgName> retired to the bay of
<placeName>Shido</placeName> in the same province, and <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> pursued them
thither with about eighty horse. When the <orgName>Heike</orgName> perceived
this they said; "The <persName>Genji</persName> have but a few men; let us attack
and surround them." So a force of a thousand men landed
and advanced to enclose the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and cut them to pieces; but
just then the rest of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, to the number of about two
hundred, who had been left behind at <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, came riding
up, anxious not to be late for the fight. When the <orgName>Heike</orgName> saw
this, they cried out : "Ah! here is the main force of the
<persName>Genji</persName>. Who knows how many tens of thousands there may
be. It will never do to be surrounded!" And so they gave
<pb n="240" xml:id="p254-240"/>

way and retired, and got aboard their ships once more. And
so, at the mercy of the wind and tide, they were carried about
aimlessly with nowhere to go; a truly miserable plight indeed.
Driven from <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> by <persName>Kurō Hōgwan</persName>, they yet could not
go to <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName>, so that their condition was like that of spirits
wandering between life and death.
</p>
<p>
Now when <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> had finished the count of the heads
of the foe taken at the bay of <placeName>Shido</placeName>, he summoned <persName>Ise Saburō
Yoshimori</persName> and said; "You know that <persName>Dennai Saemon
Noriyoshi</persName>, the eldest son of <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName>, went to
the province of <placeName>Iyo</placeName> with three thousand men to chastise <persName>Kono-no-Shiro</persName> of that province for not obeying the orders of the
<persName>Heike</persName>, and that he returned to the Palace at <placeName>Yashima</placeName> with the
heads of a hundred and fifty of his retainers. Now I have
heard that he will arrive here to-day, so do you go to meet him
and see if you cannot arrange something." So <persName>Yoshimori</persName>
withdrew after a respectful salutation, and started off with a
band of sixteen of his own followers, all attired in white,
carrying a white banner that he had received from his master.
</p>
<p>
Before long <persName>Ise Saburō</persName> and his men encountered the army
of <persName>Dennai Saemon</persName>, and when they were about one cho away,
both sides flew their flags, the white and the red respectively.
Then <persName>Ise Saburō</persName> sent a messenger to <persName>Dennai</persName> saying:
"As
your lordship may have heard, <persName>Kurō Taiyu-no-Hōgwan Dono</persName>,
the younger brother of the lord of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, has received an
Imperial Edict from the <persName>Ho-o</persName> to destroy the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and is now
on campaign in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>. I, <persName>Ise Saburo Yoshi-
mori</persName>, belong to his train, but I haye not come to fight, for we
have no weapons and carry no bows, only I have something
that I wish to discuss with your lordship, so I pray you allow
me to pass through your army." At this request the three
thousand men opened their ranks and let him through. So
<persName>Ise Saburō</persName> met <persName>Dennai Saemon</persName> and spoke thus: As your
lordship has no doubt heard, <persName>Kurō Taiyū-no-Hōgwan Yoshi-
tsune</persName>, the younger brother of <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName>, has advanced
<pb n="241" xml:id="p255-241"/>

to this country to destroy the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and the day before
yesterday he arrived at <placeName>Katsuura</placeName> in <placeName>Awa</placeName> and took your uncle
<persName>Sakurama-no-suke</persName> and destroyed his fortress. Yesterday he
marched on <placeName>Yashima</placeName> and fought a battle there and burned the
Palace, after which the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> threw himself into the sea.
<persName>Munemori</persName> and his son were captured alive, and <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName>
has put an end to his life. As for the others, some have
committed suicide and some have thrown themselves into the
waves. This morning at the bay of <placeName>Shido</placeName> all who remained
were killed or taken, and among them your father <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Dono</persName> was taken prisoner. He was entrusted to my
charge, and all last night he was lamenting and saying:
Alas, my son <persName>Dennai Saemon Noriyoshi</persName> never dreams of
this, and to-morrow he will give battle and be killed;
and so
I took pity on him and have come thus far to bring you
tidings. Why need you then fight with us and die? For
if you will lay down your arms and surrender, you will be
able to see your father once again. The matter is in your
power to decide." When he heard this, <persName>Dennai Saemon</persName> said:
"What you have told me is just what I have already heard.”
And so he laid down his arms and surrendered. And as their
commander thus yielded, his three thousand soldiers also gave
up their arms and surrendered without more ado to <persName>Yoshimori</persName>
and his sixteen men. So <persName>Yoshimori</persName> brought <persName>Dennai Saemon</persName>
to <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> and told him all that he had done.
"Your plan
is not a new one," said the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, "but it is most admirable."
and he bade them give <persName>Dennai Saemon</persName> his weapons and hand
him over to <persName>Ise Saburō</persName>. He then asked the soldiers what
their intentions might be, whereupon they replied: “We are
men of distant provinces, and do not care for anyone in
particular, but are ready to follow any master who will pacify
the country and rule it." So the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, thinking these
sentiments very proper, added the whole three thousand to
his own force

<p>
Now on the same day, the twenty second, at the Hour

of the Dragon (8 a.m.), the other two hundred ships that had
remained behind at <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> and <placeName>Fukushima</placeName> arrived at the
shore of <placeName>Yashima</placeName> under the command of <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, only to find
that the whole of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> had been conquered by <persName>Kurō
Hōgwan</persName>, and that there was nothing left for them to do. "We
are like iris on the sixth day, or flowers after a service, or an
agreement after a battle; " they said laughing.
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">iris on the sixth day, i.e. too late, the Shobu or iris festival was held on the
fifth day of the fifth month.</note>
<p>
Now after the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> had crossed to <placeName>Yashima</placeName> the priest
of the shrine of <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName>, <persName>Tsumori-no-Nagamori</persName>, went up to
the Capital and sought audience with the <persName>Hō-ō</persName>, saying: "On
the sixteenth day at the Hour of the Ox (2 a.m.), the whirring
of a <term>Kaburaya</term> proceeded from the third sanctuary of my
shrine, and went away over toward the West." On hearing
this the <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was very glad and presented <persName>Nagamori</persName> with a
sacred sword and other treasures to be dedicated to <persName>Sumiyoshi
Daimyōjin</persName>. In former days, when the <persName>Empress Jingō</persName> went
forth to subdue <placeName>Korea</placeName>, the vengeful spirits of two deities
deigned to proceed from the shrine of <placeName>Ise</placeName> to accompany
her, and took up their stations on the bow and stern of her
ship, so that by their help she subjected <placeName>Korea</placeName> to her will.
When the war in this foreign land was ended and she returned to
her country, one of these deities took up his abode at <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, and this is <persName>Sumiyoshi Daimyōjin</persName>, while
the other deigned to go and stay at <placeName>Suwo</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Shinano</placeName>, and is now called <persName>Suwo Daimyōjin</persName>. That this deity
should deign not to forget his former expedition, and should now
once again go forth to destroy the enemies of the Throne was
a great source of comfort both to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and his subjects.

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>THE FIGHT AT DAN-NO-URA.</head>
<p>Meanwhile <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, after his victory at <placeName>Yashima</placeName>,
crossed over to <placeName>Suwo</placeName> to join his brother <persName>Noriyori</persName>, and, strange
<pb n="243" xml:id="p257-243"/>

to say, the place which the <orgName>Heike</orgName> next reached was called
<placeName>Hikushima</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Nagato</placeName>, while the <orgName>Genji</orgName> went to
<placeName>Oitsu</placeName> in the same province. Just at this time <persName>Tanso</persName>, the <persName>Bettō</persName>
of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, of the province of <placeName>Kii</placeName>, who was under great
obligations to the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, suddenly changed his mind and
hesitated as to which side he should support. So he went to
the shrine of <placeName>Ikumano</placeName> at <placeName>Tanabe</placeName> and spent seven days in
retirement there, having <term>Kagura</term> preformed, and praying before
the <persName>Gongen</persName>. As a result of this he recieved an intimation from
the deity that he should adhere to the white banner, but, being
still doubtful, he took seven white cocks and seven red ones,
and held a cock-fight before the <persName>Gongen</persName>, and as none of the red
cocks were victorious but were all beaten and ran away, he at
last made up his mind to join the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. Therefore, assembling
all his retainers to the number of some two thousand men, and
embarking them on two hundred ships of war, he put the
emblem of the deity of the shrine on board his ship and painted
the name of <persName>Kongo Doji</persName> on the top of his standard. Accord-
ingly when this vessel with its divine burden approached the
ships of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and <persName>Heike</persName> at <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName>, both parties saluted
it reverently, but when it was seen to direct its course towards
the fleet of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> could not conceal their chagrin.
Moreover, to the further consternation of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, <persName>Kono-no-Shiro Michinobu</persName> of the province of <placeName>Iyo</placeName> also came rowing up
with a hundred and fifty large ships and went over to the fleet
of their enemies.
</p>
<p>
Thus the forces of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> went on increasing, while those
of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> grew less. The <persName>Genji</persName> had some three thousand
ships, and the <orgName>Heike</orgName> one thousand, among which were some of
Chinese build; and so, on the twenty fourth day of the third
month of the second year of Gen-ryaku, at the Hour of the
Hare (6 a.m.), at <placeName>Ta-no-ura</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Bungo</placeName>, at
<placeName>Moji-ga-seki</placeName>, and at <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Nagato</placeName>, at
<placeName>Akama-ga-seki</placeName>, began the final battle of the <orgName>Gen</orgName> and <orgName>Hei</orgName>.
</p>
<p>
On that day the <roleName>Hogwan</roleName> and <persName>Kajiwara</persName> were on the point
<pb n="244" xml:id="p258-244"/>

of open warfare with each other. <persName>Kajiwara</persName> came to the
<persName>Hōgwan</persName> and requested that he might be allowed to lead the
<persName>Genji</persName> fleet.
"Certainly," replied <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, "if I am
prevented." "That is not proper," answered <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, "for your
lordship is Commander-in-Chief." "By no means," replied the
<persName>Hōgwan</persName>, "<persName>Yoritomo</persName> is the real Commander-in-Chief, and I am
only a Marshal of the forces, so I am equal in rank to you."
"H'm" grumbled <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, disappointed of his expectation of
leading the army, "his lordship is not naturally suited to lead
warriors." "Your lordship seems to me the biggest fool in
<placeName>Nippon</placeName>," retorted <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, laying his hand on his sword-hilt.
"This to me!" exclaimed <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, also laying his hand on his
sword, "I, who have no other lord but <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName>!"
At this his eldest son <persName>Genda Kagesue</persName>, his second son <persName>Heiji
Kagetaka</persName> and his third son <persName>Saburo, Kageie</persName>, numbering with
their retainers, fourteen or fifteen in all, sprang forward with
bared weapons to support their father, while <persName>Ise Saburō
Yoshimori</persName>, <persName>Sato Shirōhyōye Tadanobu</persName>, <persName>Eda-no-Genzō</persName>, <persName>Kumai-no-Tarō</persName>, <persName>Saitō-bō Benkei</persName> and the rest of the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> men
made haste to surround them, each eager to cut them down.
At this point <persName>Miura-no-suke</persName> restrained the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> and <persName>Doi-no-Jirō</persName> caught hold of <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, beseeching them: "If you fight
each other thus in the face of such a crisis, we may be
overpowered by the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and when <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName> hears of
it there will be trouble." So the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> calmed his anger and
<persName>Kajiwara</persName> also regained his composure, but from that time
<persName>Kajiwara</persName> nursed his enmity against <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, and spoke evil
of him, so that at last he got him put to death, as is elsewhere
recorded.
</p>
<p>
Now the two hosts of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and <persName>Heike</persName> faced each other
scarcely thirty cho distant on the water; and as the tide was
running strongly through <placeName>Moji</placeName>, <placeName>Akama</placeName> and <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName>, the
<persName>Heike</persName> ships were carried down by the current against their will,
while the <orgName>Genji</orgName> were naturally able to advance on them with the
tide. <persName>Kajiwara</persName> with his sons and retainers to the number of
<pb n="245" xml:id="p259-245"/>

fourteen or fifteen, stuck close to the shore, and catching on
with rakes to some ships of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> that went astray, they
boarded them and sprang from one ship to the other, cutting
their men down both at bow and stern and doing great deeds.
And their merit that day has been specially recorded.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9" xml:id="v11_ch9">
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>LONG BOWSHOTS.</head>
<p>Thus both armies joined battle all along the line, and the
roar of their warcries was such as to be heard even to the
highest heavens of <persName>Brahma</persName>, and to cause the deity deep under the
earth to start in amazement. Then <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName>, coming forth on to the deck-house of his ship, shouted
to his men in a mighty voice: "Even in <placeName>India</placeName> and <placeName>China</placeName> and
also in our own country, with the most renowned leader and the
bravest warriors an army cannot prevail if fate be against it.
Yet must our honour be dear to us, and we must show a bold
front to these Eastern soldiers. Lut us then pay no heed to our
lives, but think of nothing but fighting as bravely as we may."
<persName>Hida-no-Saburo Saemon Kagetsune</persName> against repeated this
proclamation to the samurai. "Ho! these Eastern fellows may
have a great name for their horsemanship," shouted <persName>Aku-shichi-
byōye Kagekiyo</persName>, "but they know nothing about sea-fights, and
they will be like fish up a tree, so that we will pick them up
one by one and pitch them into the sea!" "And let their
Commander <persName>Kuro Yoshitsune</persName> be the special object of your
attack," added <persName>Etchu-no-Jirōhyōye Moritsugu</persName>, "he is a little
fellow with a fair complexion and his front teeth stick out a bit,
so you will know him by that. He often changes his clothes.
and armour, so take care he doesn't escape you!"
"Who
cares for that wretched little fellow?" replied <persName>Aku-shichi</persName>,
"Cheer up, my brave comrades; we'll soon pick him up under
our arms and fling him into the sea!
"
</p>
<p>
After <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori</persName> had thus addressed his
<pb n="246" xml:id="p260-246"/>

men he took a small boat and rowed across to the ship of the
<persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>. "Our own men look well enough," said he,
"only <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu Shigeyoshi</persName> seems doubtful in his allegiance.
I pray you let me take off his head." But he has served us well
so far, "replied <persName>Munemori</persName>," so how can we do this only on
suspicion? Anyhow, let him be summoned." So <persName>Shigeyoshi</persName>
came into the presence of the <persName>Daijin</persName>. He was attired in a
hitatare of yellowish red colour with a little black in it, and armour
laced with light red leather. "How now, <persName>Shigeyoshi</persName>? Do you
intend treachery ?" said <persName>Munemori</persName>, “for your conduct to-day
has a suspicious look. Do you tell your men of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> to bear
themselves well in the fight, and don't play the dastard.”
"Why
should I play the dastard? said <persName>Shigeyoshi</persName> as he retired from
before the <persName>Daijin</persName>. Meanwhile <persName>Tomomori</persName> had been standing by
with his hand gripping his sword-hilt hard enough to break it,
casting meaning looks at <persName>Munemori</persName> to intimate his wish to cut <persName>Shige-
yoshi</persName> down, but as the latter gave no sign he could do nothing.
</p>
<p>
So the <orgName>Heike</orgName> divided their thousand vessels into three fleets.
In the van rowed <persName>Yamaga-no-Hyōtōji Hidetō</persName> with five hundred
ships, and after him came the <persName>Matsuura</persName> with three hundred
more; last of all came the <orgName>Heike</orgName> nobles with two hundred.
Now <persName>Yamaga-no-Hyōtōji</persName> who led the van was the strongest
archer in all <placeName>Kyūshū</placeName>, and he chose five hundred men who drew
the bow better than most, though not equal to himself, and
placed them in the bows of his ships, shoulder to shoulder, so
that they let fly a volley of five hundred arrows at once.
</p>
<p>
The fleet of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> was the more numerous with its three
thousand ships, but as their men shot from various places here
and there, their force did not show to advantage. <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
himself, who was fighting in the forefront of the battle, was
greatly embarrassed by the arrows of the foe that fell like rain.
on his shield and armour. So, elated by their victory in the
first attack, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> pressed onward, and the roar of their
shouting mingled with the booming of their war-drums that
continuously sounded the onset.
</p>
<p><pb n="247" xml:id="p261-247"/>

Now on the side of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, <persName>Wada-no-Kotaro Yoshimori</persName>
did not go on shipboard, but mounted his horse and sat himself
firmly in the saddle with his feet deep in the stirrups, riding into
the midst of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> host and letting fly his arrows right and
left. A famous archer he had always been, and no enemy within
the
space of three cho escaped his arrows, but one shaft he shot
an extraordinary distance on which was a request to return it to
the marksman. When it was withdrawn by order of <persName>Tomomori</persName>
it was seen to be feathered with white wing-feathers of the crane
mixed with black ones of the wild-goose, a plain bamboo shaft
thirteen handbreadths and three fingers long, inscribed at the
space of a handbreadth from the lashing on the butt with the
name <persName>Wada-no-Kōtarō Yoshimori</persName> painted in lacquer. Among
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> too there were some fine archers, but none who could
do a feat like this. After a while however, <persName>Nii-no-Kishirō
Chikakiyo</persName> of <placeName>Iyo</placeName> stepped forward and shot it back again. It
flew to a distance of more than three cho and struck deep into
the left arm of <persName>Miura-no-Ishi Sakon-no-Taro</persName>, who was standing
about a tan behind <persName>Wada</persName>. "Ha-ha!" laughed <persName>Miura's</persName> men as
they came crowding round," <persName>Wada-no-Kotarō</persName> boasts no one
can equal him at shooting, and now he has been put to shame
openly." Then <persName>Yoshimori</persName>, angered at this, sprang into a small
boat and pressed on into the midst of the foe, drawing his bow
lustily so that very many of his adversaries were killed and
wounded.
</p>
<p>
Not long afterwards a large shaft of plain bamboo stuck
into the boat in which <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> was standing with a similar
request that it should be shot back again. It was feathered with
the tail feathers of a copper pheasant and was fourteen
handbreadths and three fingers lỏng. At a distance of one
handbreadth from the butt-lashing the name of the sender was painted
in lacquer : "<persName>Nii-no-Kishirō Chikakiyo</persName> of <placeName>Iyo</placeName>." Then the
<persName>Hōgwan</persName> called to <persName>Gotōbyōye Sanemoto</persName> and enquired :
"Who
is there who can return this shaft to the sender ?" "Asari-no-Yoichi of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> of <placeName>Kai</placeName> is the most likely;' answered <persName>Goto</persName>.
<pb n="248" xml:id="p262-248"/>

"Call him then," replied <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. When he came into his
presence; "How now, <persName>Yoichi</persName>," he exclaimed," can you shoot
back this arrow that has just been loosed at us from the offing
with a request that we return it?" "I can but try," replied
<persName>Yoichi</persName>. Then he took the arrow and measured it. “This shaft
is weak and somewhat lacking in length," he objected, "if it is
all the same I would rather use one of my own; and taking a
large lacquered shaft feathered with the black body feathers
of a bird, fifteen handbreadths and three fingers in length, and
fitting it to his nine foot lacquered bow, he drew it with all his
might and let fly. This also flew more than four chō, and hit
<persName>Nii-no-Kishirō Chikakiyo</persName> clean in his middle as he stood on the
stern of one of the great ships, so that he fell headlong to the
bottom. This <persName>Asari-no-Yoichi</persName> had long been famed for his skill
with the bow and could bring down a running stag at a distance
of two cho and never miss.
</p>
<p>
After this both sides set their faces against each other and
fought grimly without a thought for their lives, neither giving
way an inch. But as the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had on their side an <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
endowed with the Ten Virtues and the Three Sacred Treasures
of the Realm, things went hard with the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and their hearts
were beginning to fail them, when suddenly something that they
at first took for a white cloud, but which soon appeared to be a
white banner floating in the breaze, came drifting over the two
fleets from the upper air and finally settled on the stern of one of
the <orgName>Genji</orgName> ships, hanging on by the rope.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9" xml:id="v11_ch9a">
<head>CHAPTER IXa.</head>
<head>THE DROWNING OF THE EMPEROR.</head>
<p>When he saw this, <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, regarding it as a sign from
<persName>Hachiman Dai-bosatsu</persName>, removed his helmet, and after washing
his hands, did obeisance; his men all following his example.
Moreover a shoal of some thousands of dolphins also made its
appearance from the offing and made straight for the ships of the
<pb n="249" xml:id="p263-249"/>

<persName>Heike</persName>. Then <persName>Munemori</persName> called the diviner <persName>Ko-hakase Harunobu</persName>
and said: "There are always many dolphins about here, but I
have never seen so many as these before; what may it portend ?”
"If they turn back," replied <persName>Harunobu</persName>, "the <orgName>Genji</orgName> will be
destroyed; but if they go on then our own side will be in
danger." No sooner had he finished speaking than the dolphins
dived under the <orgName>Heike</orgName> ships and passed on.
</p>
<p>
Then, as things had come to this pass, <persName>Awa-no-Mimbu
Shigeyoshi</persName>, who for three years had been a loyal supporter of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, now that his son <persName>Dennai Saemon Noriyoshi</persName> had been
captured, made up his mind that all was lost, and suddenly
forsook his allegiance and deserted to the enemy. Great was the
regret of <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> that he had not cut
off the head of 'that villain <persName>Shigeyoshi</persName>,' but now it was
unavailing.
</p>
<p>
Now the strategy of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been to put the stoutest
warriors on board the ordinary fighting ships and the inferior
soldiers on the big ships of Chinese build, so that the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
should be induced to attack the big ships, thinking that the
commanders were on board them, when they would be able to
surround and destroy them. But when <persName>Shigeyoshi</persName> went over and
joined the <orgName>Genji</orgName> he revealed this plan to them, with the result
that they immediately left the big ships alone and concentrated
their attacks on the smaller ones on which were the <orgName>Heike</orgName>
champions. Later on the men of <placeName>Shikoku</placeName> and <placeName>Kyushu</placeName> all left the
<persName>Heike</persName> in a body and went over to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. Those who had
so far been their faithful retainers now turned their bows against
their lords and drew the sword against their own masters. On
one shore the heavy seas beat on the cliff so as to forbid any
landing, while on the other stood the serried ranks of the enemy
waiting with levelled arrows to receive them. And so on this
day the struggle for supremacy between the two houses of <orgName>Gen</orgName>
and <orgName>Hei</orgName> was at last decided.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the <orgName>Genji</orgName> warriors sprang from one <persName>Heike</persName> vessel
to the other, shooting and cutting down the sailors and helms-
<pb n="250" xml:id="p264-250"/>

men, so that they flung themselves in panic to the bottom of the
ships unable to navigate them any longer. Then <persName>Shin-Chūnagon
Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> rowed in a small boat to the Imperial Vessel
and cried out: "You see what affairs have come to! Clean
up the ship, and throw everything unsightly into the sea!" And
he ran about the ship from bow to stern, sweeping and cleaning
and gathering up the dust with his own hands. "But how goes
the battle, <persName>Chūnagon Dono</persName>?" asked the <roleName>Court Ladies</roleName>. "Oh,
you'll soon see some rare, gallants from the East," he replied,
bursting into loud laughter. "What? Is this a time for
joking?" they answered, and they lifted up their voices and
wept aloud.
</p>
<p>
Then the <persName>Nii Dono</persName>, who had already resolved what she
would do, donning a double outer dress of dark grey mourning
colour, and tucking up the long skirts of her glossy silk hakama,
put the Sacred Jewel under her arm, and the Sacred Sword in
her girdle, and taking the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> in her arms, spoke thus :
Though I am but a woman I will not fall into the hands of the
foe, but will accompany our Sovereign Lord. Let those of
you who will, follow me." And she glided softly to the
gunwale of the vessel. The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was eight years old that year,
but looked much older than his age, and his appearance was so
lovely that he shed as it were a brilliant radiance about him, and
his long black hair hung loose far down his back. With a look
of surprise and anxiety on his face he enquired of the <persName>Nii-Dono</persName>:
"Where is it that you are going to take me, <persName>Ama-ze</persName>?" Turn-
ing to her youthful Sovereign with tears streaming down her
cheeks, she answered: "Perchance our Lord does not know
that, though through the merit of the Ten Virtues practised in
former lives you have been reborn to the Imperial Throne in
this world, yet by the power of some evil karma destiny now
claims you. So now turn to the east and bid farewell to the
deity of the <placeName>Great Shrine of Ise</placeName>, and then to the west and say the
<term>Nembutsu</term> that <persName>Amida Buddha</persName> and the Holy Ones may come to
welcome you to the <placeName>Pure Western Land</placeName>. This land is called
<pb n="251" xml:id="p265-251"/>

small as a grain of millet, but yet is it now but a vale of misery.
There is a Pure Land of happiness beneath the waves, another
Capital where no sorrow is. Thither it is that I am taking Our
Lord." And thus comforting him, and binding his long hair up
in his dove-coloured robe, blinded with tears the child-Sovereign
put his beautiful little hands together and turned first to the east
to say farewell to the deity of <placeName>Ise</placeName> and to <persName>Sho-Hachimangū</persName>, and
then to the west and repeated the <term>Nembutsu</term>, after which the <persName>Nii-
Dono</persName>, holding him tightly in her arms and saying consolingly:
"In the depths of the Ocean we have a Capital" sank with him
at last beneath the waves.
</p>
<p>
Ah, the pity of it! That the gust of the spring wind of
Impermanence should so suddenly sweep away his flower form.
That the cruel billows should thus engulf his Jewel Person.
Since his Palace was called the <placeName>Palace of Longevity</placeName>, he should
have passed a long life therein; its gate was called the <placeName>Gate of
Eternal Youth</placeName>, the barrier that old age should not pass; and
yet, ere he had reached the age of ten years, he had become like
the refuse that sinks to the bottom of the sea. How vain it was
to proclaim him as one who sat on the Throne as a reward of
the Ten Virtues ! It was like the Dragon that rides on the
clouds descending to become a fish at the bottom of the ocean.
He who abode in a Palace fair as the terraced pavilions of the
highest heaven of <persName>Brahma</persName>, or the paradise where <persName>S'akya Muni</persName>
dwells, among his <roleName>Ministers</roleName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> of the Nine Families who
did him humble obeisance, thus came to a miserable end beneath
the ocean waves.

<p>Now when the <persName>Imperial Consort Kenrei-mon-in</persName> saw what
had come to pass, she put her inkstone and warming-stone into
each side of the bosom of her robe and jumped into the sea.
But <persName>Watanabe-no-Gengo Umanojo Mutsuru</persName> rowed up in a small

pinned the skirt of her hakama to the side of the ship and she
stumbled and fell, whereupon the <orgName>Genji</orgName> soldiers seized her and
held her back. Then one of then wrenched off the lock of the
casket to open it, when suddenly his eyes were darkened and
blood poured from his nose. At this, <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName>, who had been captured alive, and was standing by,
exclaimed: "Hold! That is the Holy <term>Naishi-dokoro</term>, the Sacred
Mirror that no profane eye must behold!" Whereat the
soldiers were awestricken and trembled with fear; and the <persName>Ho-
gwan</persName> bade <persName>Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName> put away the casket as it was
before.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile <persName>Kadowaki Taira-no-Chūnagon Norimori</persName> and
<persName>Shuri-no-Taiyu Tsunemori</persName> placed heavy anchors on their armour
and hand in hand leapt into the sea. <persName>Komatsu-no-Shin-sammi
Chūjō Sukemori</persName>, his brother <persName>Komatsu-no-Shosho Arimori</persName>, and
their cousin <persName>Sama-no-kami Yukimori</persName>, also followed their example
and did likewise. But though the other members of the family
thus leapt into the waves, the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> and his son did
not, but stood on the gunwale of the ship looking round to see
what would happen. Seeing them thus hesitate, some of the
<persName>Heike</persName> samurai, under pretence of pushing by hurriedly, thrust
<persName>Munemori</persName> over into the sea, and his son, <persName>Uemon-no-kami Kiyo-
mune</persName>, seeing this, sprang in after him. Now the others had put
heavy objects on their shoulders and held on to each other so
that they might be sure to sink, but these two did not do any
such thing, but, being good swimmers, they swam about hither
and thither, the <persName>Daijin</persName> willing to sink or be rescued whichever
his son might do, when <persName>Ise Saburo Yoshimori</persName> chanced to come
<pb n="253" xml:id="p267-253"/>

up in a small boat and drag <persName>Kiyomune</persName> out with a rake, after
which <persName>Munemori</persName> allowed himself to be pulled out also. Seeing
this, <persName>Hida-no-Saburōemon Kagetsune</persName>, foster-brother of <persName>Mune-
mori</persName>, jumped into <persName>Yoshimori's</persName> boat and aimed a blow at him
with his sword, shouting: "Who are you to take my lord
captive ?" But <persName>Yoshimori's</persName> page, perceiving his master's
danger, thrust himself in between to intercept the blow, which
fell full on his helmet and split it open. A second blow cut off
the faithful page's head, and <persName>Yoshimori</persName> was again in great peril,
when <persName>Hori-no-Yataro</persName> in the next boat drew his bow and shot an
arrow full in <persName>Saburoemon's</persName> face, and as he staggered back for
a moment, <persName>Hori</persName> boarded the boat and grappled with him. As
the two were struggling together, one of <persName>Hori's</persName> men, who had
followed his master close, stooped and drew <persName>Saburoemon's</persName>
dirk, and, lifting up the skirts of his armour, stabbed him so
deeply three times that his hand and the hilt went in also, after
which he cut off his head. How must <persName>Munemori</persName> have felt
to see his foster-brother thus slain before his eyes.
</p>
<p>
Now, as we have said, none could face the arrows of <persName>Noto-no-kami Noritsune</persName> and live; and he had resolved to fight to the
last this day. He was brilliantly attired in a hitatare brocaded
on a red ground, and a suit of armour laced with Chinese silk;
he wore a helmet decorated with lofty horns, and a sword
mounted in gold and silver. In his quiver were twenty four
arrows feathered with black and white feathers, and with his
<term>Shigetō</term> bow in his hand he shot them hither and thither, killing
and wounding many of the foe. Then, when all his shafts were
spent, he seized a great black-lacquered two-handed sword in one
hand and a white-handled halberd in the other, and cut and
slashed on all sides with reckless valour. The <persName>Shin-Chūnagon
Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName> despatched a messenger to him saying:
"Why add to your sins by slaying so many men of little repute?
Can you find no famous adversary?" "True," replied <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName>," I will try a fall with some great Captain." And
shortening his halberd in his hand he cut his way through the
<pb n="254" xml:id="p268-254"/>

ships, dealing blows vigorously on every side, but as he did not
recognise the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> he took another splendidly armed
warrior for him and sprang across to engage him. Now <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
was fighting close by, but somehow or other did not turn
to attack <persName>Noritsune</persName>. The latter, however, having thus chanced
to spring on board the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> ship, suddenly espied him and
made at him to grapple. <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, feeling himself unable to
meet his onset, stuck his halberd under his left arm and leaped
nimbly over to one of the ships of his own side, a distance of full
twenty feet. <persName>Noto-no-kami</persName>, less skilled in such tricks, was
unable to follow him, and seeing that there was no more to be
done, he tore off and flung away the sleeves and skirts of his
armour, keeping only the breastplate, and, standing on the
deckhouse of the ship with his hair all loose and dishevelled, he flung
out his arms and shouted loudly: "Let any of the <orgName>Genji</orgName> who
thinks himself somebody come forth and grapple with me and take
me prisoner! I should like to go down to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> and have
a word with <persName>Yoritomo</persName>! Who'll come and try?" But there
was none who answered his challenge.
</p>
<p>
Now there was a warrior named <persName>Aki-no-Taro Sanemitsu</persName>,
the son of <persName>Aki-no-Tairyo Saneyasu</persName> of <placeName>Tosa</placeName>, who possessed an
estate in a district of <placeName>Aki</placeName>, and he was so strong that he was said
to possess the strength of twenty or thirty men. He had a
retainer who was no less powerful than he, while his brother
<persName>Jiro</persName> was also no ordinary warrior.
"What is <persName>Noto Dono</persName> that
we should fear him," they said; "he is no doubt a mighty
warrior, but what of that? If he were a devil a hundred feet high,
we three could settle him." And they got into a small boat and
drew alongside the ship where <persName>Noritsune</persName> was, and boarded it and
sprang at him together with their swords drawn. <persName>Noritsune</persName> on
his part sprang forward also, and seizing <persName>Aki-no-Taro's</persName> retainer
who was foremost, kicked him into the sea; then, taking <persName>Aki-no-Taro</persName> himself under his left arm, and his brother <persName>Jiro</persName> under
his right and gripping them tight, he sprang over into the
waves, shouting: "Come along, both of you, to the
<pb n="255" xml:id="p269-255"/>

<placeName>Mountain of Shide</placeName>!" And he was twenty six years old that
year.

<head>ENTRY OF THE SACRED MIRROR INTO THE CAPITAL.</head>
<p>Then <persName>Shin-Chūnagon Tomomori-no-Kyō</persName>, who had been
watching how the day was going, at length saw that nothing
remained but to put an end to his life, and calling his
fosterbrother <persName>Iga-no-Hei-naisaemon Ienaga</persName>, he said: "Is it not time
to fulfil the promise we made?" Certainly;" replied <persName>Ienaga</persName>.
And he assisted <persName>Tomomori</persName> to don two suits of armour,
afterwards doing the same himself, and the two leaped into the sea
clasped in each other's arms. Some twenty samurai who were
with them at once followed them into the waves; but <persName>Etchū-no-Jirōhyōye Moritsugu</persName>, <persName>Kazusa-no-Gorōhy ōye</persName>, <persName>Akushichi-byōye
Kagekiyo</persName> and <persName>Hida-no-Jirōhyōye</persName> managed to elude the enemy
somehow and escape. And now the whole sea was red with
the banners and insignia that they tore off and cut away, so that
it looked like the waters of the <placeName>Tatsuta-gawa</placeName> when it is flecked
with the maple leaves that the wind brings down in autumn,
while the white breakers that rolled up on the beach were dyed
a scarlet colour. The deserted empty ships rocked mournfully

<persName>Sanuki-no-Chūjo Tokizane</persName> and <persName>Munemori's</persName> eight year old son
<persName>Hyobu-no-Sho Masaakira</persName>, were captured alive, beside the priests
<persName>Nii-no-Sozu Senshin</persName>, <persName>Hosshoji-no-Shugyo No-en</persName>, <persName>Chūnagon-no-Risshi Chugai</persName> and <persName>Kyoju-bo-no-Ajari Yuen</persName>, and the samurai

already laid down their arms and surrendered before the battle.
Forty three Court Ladies were taken also, including the <persName>Imperial
Consort Kenreimon-in</persName>, the foster-mother of the <persName>Emperor
Takakura</persName> and wife of <persName>Rokujo Motozane</persName>, <persName>Ro-no-Onkata</persName> another
daughter of <persName>Kiyomori</persName>, <persName>Dainagon-no-Suke</persName>, <persName>Sotsu-no-Suke</persName>, <persName>Jibu-
Kyo-no-Tsubone</persName> and others; forty three in all. Thus by the
fall of spring in the second year of Genryaku,-a date of ill-omen
indeed-the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> rested beneath the waves, while his <roleName>Ministers</roleName>
and <persName>Courtiers</persName> tossed on the billows; the Imperial Consort and
her Ladies were delivered into the hands of the Eastern
barbarians to return to the Ancient Capital with all the <persName>Courtiers</persName>
and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> as captives in the midst of myriads of foes, and their
anquish must have been as deep as the regret of <persName>Shu-bai-shin</persName> at
not wearing brocade, or the resentment of <persName>O-sho-kun</persName> when she
set out for the land of <placeName>Ko</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
On the third day of the fourth month <persName>Kuro Hōgwan
Yoshitsune</persName> despatched <persName>Genpachi Hirotsuna</persName> as a messenger to
the <persName>Ho-o</persName> with the tidings that: "On the twenty fourth day of
the third month at the Hour of the Hare, at <placeName>Ta-no-ura</placeName> and
<placeName>Moji-ga-seki</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Buzen</placeName>, and at <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName> and
<placeName>Akama-ga-seki</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Nagato</placeName>, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have been
completely annihilated, and the Sacred Mirror and Sacred Seal
will forthwith be returned to the Capital." When the <persName>Ho-o</persName>
heard this news he was exceedingly pleased, and calling
<persName>Hirotsuna</persName> into the courtyard, demanded to be told all details of
the battle, in his joy conferring on him the title of <persName>Sahyōye</persName> on
the spot. On the fifth day His Majesty ordered <persName>To-Hōgwan
Nobumori</persName>, one of the Imperial Guard, to go and see that the
two Sacred Emblems were properly brought back; so he took
one of the Imperial Horses and set off at full speed for the
<placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> without even delaying to go back to his
lodging.
</p>
<p>
So <persName>Kuro Hōgwan Yoshitsune</persName> started on his way to the
Capital, bringing with him the captured <persName>Courtiers</persName> and Ladies of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and on the fourteenth day they arrived at the shore
<pb n="257" xml:id="p271-257"/>

of <placeName>Akashi</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Harima</placeName>. It is a place famous for
its beauty, and when the moon rose bright as the evening grew
late, it seemed no less beautiful than the moon of autumn.
Little had the Ladies of the Court imagined that this would be
their fate when they passed by a year ago, and when they
thought of it they wept softly. <persName>Sotsu-no-suke Dono</persName>, the wife of
<persName>Tokitada</persName>, gazing long at the moon and pondering deeply over
all her sad experiences, was dissolved in tears, and expressed her
feelings in the following verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"As I gaze on the moon it rests in my sleeves that are moistened;</l>
<l>Tell me, I prithee, O Moon, tales of the Palace of yore."</l>
</lg>
<p>
"Here the moon is the same as that which shone o'er the
Palace.
But though it still shine bright, how can it ligh.cn our
Sang <persName>Jibu Kyō-no-Tsubone</persName>, while <persName>Dai-
nagon-no-Suke-no-Tsubone</persName> added :

<l>"Exiles, but for a night do we camp by the shore of <placeName>Akashi</placeName>,</l>
<l>But how constant the moon ever looks down on this strand.”</l>
</lg>
<p>
And, stern warrior though the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> was, when he saw
how painful were their reminiscences of their former happy days,
has heart was moved to its inmost depths.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty fifth day of the same month, when they
heard that the two Sacred Treasures had arrived at <placeName>Toba</placeName>,
<persName>Kageyu-no-koji-no-Chūnagon Tsunefusa-no-Kyō</persName>, <persName>Kebiishi-no-Betto Saemon-no-kami Saneie</persName>, <persName>Takakura-no-Saisho Chujo Yasu-
michi</persName>, <persName>Gon-no-Uchuben Kanetada</persName>, <persName>Enami-no-Chūjo Kintoki</persName> and
<persName>Tajima-no-Shōsho Noriyoshi</persName> of the <persName>Court Nobles</persName>, and <persName>Izu-no-Kurando Taiyu Yorikane</persName>, <persName>Ishikawa-no-Hangwan-dai Yoshikane</persName>
and <persName>Saemon-no-Jo Aritsuna</persName> of the <persName>Samurai</persName>, went forth from the
Palace to meet them; and the same night, at the Hour of the
Rat (12. midnight.), the Sacred Mirror and the Sacred Gem
were handed over to the keeping of the <placeName>Dajōkwan</placeName>. The Sacred
Sword was lost, but the Sacred Gem in its casket floated on the
waves, and was recovered by <persName>Kataoka-no-Taro Tsuneharu</persName>.

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>The Heike PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS.</head>
<p>When he heard that <persName>Prince Morihito</persName>, the second son of the
late <persName>Emperor Takakura</persName>, was returning to the Capital, the <persName>Ho-o</persName>
sent a car to meet him. Both his mother and his foster-mother
<persName>Jimyo-in-no-Saisho</persName> had been much grieved when he was taken
away against his will by his relations the <persName>Heike Courtiers</persName>, and
exposed to hardship with them on the waves of the <placeName>Western
Sea</placeName>, and they were now overjoyed to receive him back again.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty sixth day the <orgName>Heike</orgName> captives arrived at <placeName>Toba</placeName>,
and without delay were brought into the Capital on the same
day and paraded through the streets. In a car with both the
front and rear blinds drawn up, and the side windows open, sat
the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>, attired in a white <term>Kariginu</term>. In former
days he had had a fine figure and a fair complexion, but now,
thin and worn and burned black by the salt breezes, he did not
look the same person. But he gazed curiously all around him
as the car passed on, and did not seem particularly dejected. His
son <persName>Uemon-no-kami Kiyomune</persName> rode in the back of his father's
car, wearing a white hitatare. Choked with tears and with down
cast head, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, and
seemed to be sunk in the deepest melancholy. In the next car
rode <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyō</persName>, and <persName>Sanuki-no-Chūjō
Tokizane</persName> should have been with him, but on account of sickness
he was excused. <persName>Kura-no-kami Nobumoto</persName> also entered the
city by a side street, for he had been wounded.
</p>
<p>
And to see this spectacle the people came from far and
near, from every shrine and temple round about the city, while
from the Capital itself, high and low, young and old came
thronging out in countless myriads, lining the road all the way
from the south gate of the <placeName>Toba Palace</placeName>, by <placeName>Tsukuri-michi</placeName> and
<placeName>Yotsu-kado</placeName>; and so great was the press that the wheels of the
cars could not turn, neither could the sight-seers look back-
<pb n="259" xml:id="p273-259"/>

wards. In the famine of the periods of <term>Ji-sho</term> and <term>Yowa</term>, and in
the campaigns in the <placeName>East</placeName> and <placeName>North Provinces</placeName>, more men
perchance were slan, but the number of the survivors was
greater; and as it was not yet a year since the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had fled
from the Capital, the days of their splendour were so recent that
none could forget them, so that those who had formerly gone in
fear and trembling of them could scarcely be certain whether
their present condition was dream or reality. And as the very
lowest kind of people who had no particular concern with them
were affected to tears by the sight, the feelings of those who had
had intimate and friendly relations with them can be imagined.
Though for fear of their lives most of their hereditary vassals,
who for generations had lain under heavy obligations to them,
had gone over to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, yet they could not at once forget
their ancient friendship, and there was not one who was not
• moved to tears, while most did not even raise their eyes. The
ox-driver who drove <persName>Munemori's</persName> car was <persName>Saburo Maru</persName>, the
younger brother of that <persName>Jiro Maru</persName> who had been put to death
by <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> improper driving. This <persName>Saburo Maru</persName>
had accompanied the <orgName>Heike</orgName> to the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> and done
other work there, and at <placeName>Toba</placeName> he had petitioned <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>:
"Though Toneri and ox-drivers are the lowest kind of servants
and have no claim to consideration, yet, as I have served my
master many years and am greatly attached to him, I pray you
grant me the favour of driving his car for the last time." And
the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, touched by the request, gave the required
permission. So <persName>Saburo Maru</persName>, greatly delighted, took from the
bosom of his dress a driving-rope that he kept about him, and,
though his eyes were so blinded with tears that he could not see
where he was going, he let the oxen find their own way, and SO
drove his master.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Hō-ō</persName> watched the procession from his car at <placeName>Rokujo
Higashi-no-Doin</placeName>, and all his <persName>Courtiers</persName> and attendants drew up
their cars alongside the Imperial Car, but as the <orgName>Heike</orgName> nobles
had until lately also been in attendance on him, His Majesty
<pb n="260" xml:id="p274-260"/>

was now moved to pity at their fate. Who would have dreamed
that these haughty potentates, from whom all but lately sought
a word or a glance, could have fallen to their present condition?
And there were few who were dry-eyed at the thought. But
a year before <persName>Munemori</persName> had come in procession to the <persName>Hō-ō's</persName>
Palace to pay his respects on being raised to the position of
<persName>Naidaijin</persName>, and then he was accompanied by twelve <persName>Courtiers</persName>
of the highest rank, headed by <persName>Kwazan-in-no-Chunagon Kane-
masa-no-Kyo</persName>, while sixteen others of lower rank, led by
<persName>Kurando-no-kami Chikamune</persName>, walked before him in the van,
the procession including four of the rank of <term>Chunagon</term> and
three of that of <term>Sammi Chujo</term>. All the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName>
were in festal array to do honour to the day, and <persName>Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> was summoned into the Imperial Presence and entertained
magnificently and sent away with many presents. To-day not a
single <persName>Courtier</persName> accompanied them, and the twenty old samurai, .
who were taken with them at <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName>, were led along
behind them clad in white garments and tied up to the front
of their saddles.
</p>
<p>
Passing along <placeName>Rokujo</placeName> to the east they were led to the
river-bed, and from thence back again to the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> residence
in <placeName>Rokujo Horikawa</placeName>, where they were put under a strong
guard. Food was set before the <persName>Daijin</persName>, but his throat was
choked and he could not eat; and when night came he did not
even loosen his clothes, but lay down just as he was, wrapped
in the sleeves of his robe; but when his guards noticed that he
covered his son <persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName> with his sleeve, they exclaimed:
"Ah, among both high and low there is nothing so pathetic as
parental affection. The spreading of a sleeve is nothing in
itself, but even that shows the depth of his care;" and their tears
dropped on to the sleeves of their armour.

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>THE LETTERS OF THE TAIRA DAINAGON.</head>
<p>Now as the <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> and his son
drew near to the residence of the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> they had given
themselves up for lost, but the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, wishing if possible to
save his life, called his son <persName>Sanuki-no-Chujo Tokizane</persName> and
said: "The <persName>Hōgwan</persName> has taken a box of our secret letters. If
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> sees them, not only ourselves, but a lot of other
people will lose their lives in consequence. What is to be
done?" "The <persName>Hōgwan</persName> is an inflexible warrior, it is true,"
replied <persName>Tokizane</persName>, "but they say that he can never refuse any
request, however great, if it is made by a woman. You have
many daughters, so why not let one of them go to him, and
when they become intimate she can ask him this favour."
"Alas!" exclaimed the <persName>Dainagon</persName>, bursting into tears, "to
what have we fallen ? In the days of our power my daughters
would have become Court Ladies or Imperial Consorts, and
I would never have dreamed of allying them with any ordinary
person." "But now," replied his son, you must not dream
of such ideas. How about the one who is now seventeen, the
daughter of your present wife?" But the <persName>Dainagon</persName> could
not bring himself to this, and so presented his elder daughter,
the child of his first wife, to the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, She was a little
old, it is true, but was exceedingly beautiful and of a very
sweet disposition, so that <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> was very pleased with
her, and as he had a wife already, the daughter of <persName>Kawagoe-no-Taro Shigefusa</persName>, he put her away in a separate residence and
took the daughter of the <persName>Dainagon</persName> into his own mansion. So
the lady made her request to him concerning the letters, and he
sent them to the <persName>Dainagon</persName> forthwith without even opening the
box. <persName>Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> was exceedingly glad and immediately
burnt and got rid of them. What kind of letters they were is
unknown.
</p>
<p><pb n="262" xml:id="p276-262"/>

Seeing that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been thus overthrown, and
all the provinces quieted so that all could travel about again
without let or hindrance, and that there was no more disorder
in the Capital, people began to declare that <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> was the
greatest man in the Empire, and that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had done but
little in comparison. So by and by it came to the ears of the
Lord of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> that it was noised abroad that <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
could do what he liked with the Empire. "What sayings are
these?" he exclaimed. "Was it not owing to the plans I laid
and the armies that I sent that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> were so quickly
conquered? How could <persName>Kurō</persName> have set the Empire in order
alone? What does he mean by growing thus arrogant and
thinking he can do as he pleases? And were there no other
people available that he must become the son-in-law of this
<persName>Taira Dainagon</persName> and behave himself like a Court Noble ?
Moreover it was a shameless thing of this <persName>Dainagon</persName> to give
his daughter thus. The next thing <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> will do is to
come down and domineer here in <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>."

<p>On the sixth day of the fifth month of the second year

"I have heard that we are to start for the East to-morrow, and
I have a request to make. If the boy of eight years old, who
is written down among the prisoners, is still alive I should much
like to see him again once more." Truly," said <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>,"
that is very natural, for who can be unmindful of parental
affection?" And he immediately sent orders to <persName>Kawagoe-no-Kotaro Shigefusa</persName>, in whose charge the boy had been placed, to
take him to <persName>Munemori</persName> at once; and <persName>Kawagoe</persName>, borrowing a
car from someone, put the child and two lady attendants into
<pb n="263" xml:id="p277-263"/>

it, and went off without delay. As the child had not seen
his father for so long, his joy knew no bounds, and when
<persName>Munemori</persName> called to him: "Ah, <persName>Fuku-sho</persName>! Come along!
he rushed up to him and climbed up on his knee. "Listen, all
of you," said <persName>Munemori</persName>, stroking the boy's hair and weeping
over him, "this child has no mother; for though he was born
without any trouble, soon afterwards his mother took to her
bed and after a while died. And while she lay sick she said to
me: 'Whatever other children you may in future have by
some other wife, do not forsake this one, but look on him
as a memento of me. Do not send him away to be brought up
by some foster-mother." So when I gave him the name of
<persName>Fuku-sho</persName>, (Vice-Commander), saying that when we marched
against the enemies of the Throne <persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName> would be
the Commander-in-Chief, and I wished him to be under him
as Vice-Commander, she was overjoyed, and continued to call
him by this name right up to the time that she died, seven days
after. So whenever I see this child it always recalls her to
memory." And when he finished speaking, all the guards, and
<persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName> and the child's nurse hid their faces in their
sleeves and wept.
</p>
<p>
After a while <persName>Munemori</persName> said: Now <persName>Fuku-sho</persName>, it is time
for you to go back again;" but the child did not go: so
<persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName>, pitying him, comforted him by saying:
"Come <persName>Fuku-sho</persName>; we have some people coming to-day; but
you must come again to-morrow.” But still he would not
go, weeping and clinging tight to his father's sleeve; and so he
remained some time, till at last, as it began to grow dark, his
nurse drew him away in her arms, and the two ladies got into
the car with him and returned home.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Munemori</persName> stood looking after him a long while, sadly
reflecting that his former affection for the child was as nothing
to what he felt now. Out of tender regard for his mother's
wishes he had kept the child always beside him, and had not
sent him away to anyone to be brought up. At the age
<pb n="264" xml:id="p278-264"/>

of three he had put on the <term>Kammuri</term> and received the name
of <persName>Yoshimune</persName>, and as he grew older the beauty of his face and
figure increased also, while his disposition became the more
loveable. So <persName>Munemori</persName> became more and more attached to
him, and took him with him everywhere, so that they were
not parted for a moment even on shipboard on the waves of the
<placeName>Western Sea</placeName>; and this was the first time that they had met since
the defeat.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Shigefusa</persName> enquired of the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> what was his
pleasure concerning the child. "We cannot take him with us to
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName>," replied <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, “so you had better do as you
will with him." So <persName>Shigefusa</persName> returned to his residence and said
to the two ladies : "The <persName>Daijin</persName> will start for the East tomorrow,
but the child must stay here in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>. He is to be handed
over to <persName>Ogata-no-Saburo Koreyoshi</persName>, so bid him come
forthwith." So they again put him into the car, and he went off
joyfully with the two ladies thinking he was going to see his
father as before. When however the car drove along <placeName>Rokujo</placeName>
to the eastward and came to the river-bed, the ladies were thrown
into the greatest anxiety and consternation, suspecting that
something terrible was going to happen. In a few moments a troop
of some fifty or sixty horsemen rode down to the river-bed, and
stopping the car bade them set down the child, spreading a fur
rug on the ground for them to alight. With a surprised and
troubled expression on his face the little lord enquired: "Where
are you going to take me then?' But the two ladies could
make him no answer, and only burst out into loud lamentations.
Then one of <persName>Shigefusa's</persName> men, holding his sword ready to draw,
was just stepping round behind him from the left side to sweep
off his head, when the child perceived it and ran and threw
himself into the nurse's arms in an endeavour to escape; whereupon
the two ladies, clasping him in their arms, entreated the soldiers
to kill them instead, raising their eyes to heaven and throwing
themselves on the ground in an unavailing agony of grief.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Shigefusa</persName>, choking down his emotion, exclaimed:
<pb n="265" xml:id="p279-265"/>

"It is too late to do anything now;" and dragging the child
from their arms, struck him down with his dirk and cut off his
head, which he straightway took away to show to the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>.
Barefoot the two ladies followed him and begged earnestly that
they might be given the head, for they wished to recite the
<title>Sutras</title> for him; and the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, who was not devoid of pity,
granted their request. So the two, receiving it with deep
gratitude, bestowed it in the bosom of one of them and returned
weeping to the city.
</p>
<p>
About a week afterwards it was reported that two ladies
had drowned themselves in the <placeName>Katsura-gawa</placeName>, and one, who had
cast herself into the water with a child's head in her bosom, was
this nurse of <persName>Munemori's</persName> son. The other, who was found
clasping the dead body in her arms, was her maid-in-waiting. Seeing
that her mistress had determined to end her life, her unhappy
companion could not bear to survive her, and so had followed
her in death.

<head>KOSHIGOE.</head>
<p>On the seventh day of the fifth month of the second
year of
Gen-ryaku <persName>Kurō Taiyu-no-Hōgwan Yoshitsune</persName> set out from the
Capital with the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> and his son. When they
came to <placeName>Awata-guchi</placeName>, the Palace was far away among the clouds,
and when he beheld the clear streams of the barrier at <placeName>Ausaka</placeName>,
the <persName>Daijin</persName>, weeping bitterly, composed this verse :
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Here today by this spring I look my last on Miyako,</l>
<l>Grant that once more my face mirror itself in its wave."</l>
</lg>
<p>
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, noticing how sad and despondent was <persName>Mune-
mori</persName>, with his accustomed kindness tried to cheer him. I pray
you, if it be possible, save my life" entreated the <persName>Daijin</persName>. 'Any-
how I do not consider your life in any danger," replied the
<persName>Hōgwan</persName>, "but if it were, I would claim it as a reward of my
merit in this campaign. Perchance however, you will be banish-
<pb n="266" xml:id="p280-266"/>

ed to some distant province or far-off island." "Let me be
banished even to <placeName>Chishima</placeName> in <placeName>Ezo</placeName>," pathetically pleaded <persName>Mune-
mori</persName>, "so long as my life is preserved." It was a pitiable
exhibition.
</p>
<p>
So the days passed and on the twenty third day it was
reported that the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> was about to arrive at <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, but
<persName>Kajiwara Heizo Kagetoki</persName>, who had preceded him, spoke to
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> saying: "Now all <placeName>Nippon</placeName> is subject to your
lordship's will, and your brother <persName>Kuro Taiyu-no-Hōgwan Yoshitsune</persName>
is the only enemy you have to fear. A straw will show how
the wind blows. He declared that if he had not ridden down
the mountain behind <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, we could not have broken the
eastern and western defences. And then he had everyone,
alive or dead, brought to him for inspection, and not to <persName>Noriyori</persName>
who was of no account at all. He ordered the <persName>Chujo Shigehira</persName>
to be brought before him, and said he would come and take him
if he were not, so, thinking the consequences might be serious, I
considered well, and with the assistance of <persName>Doi</persName> himself, committed
the <persName>Chujo</persName> to the keeping of <persName>Doi-no-Jiro Sanehira</persName> and so saved the
situation." <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, quite convinced by these things, ordered
<persName>Kajiwara</persName> to take every precaution to prevent <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
approaching him; and the feudal lords, both small and great, came
hurrying up to his aid, so that he soon mustered several
thousands of horsemen. When he saw that he was thus protected:
"<persName>Kuro</persName> is a very clever fellow," quoth he, "cunning enough to
get in under these floor-mats; but I have out-witted him this
time." So he fixed a barrier at <placeName>Kane-araizawa</placeName> and there took
over <persName>Munemori</persName> and his son, ordering <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> to retire to
<placeName>Koshigoe</placeName>. When <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> understood this he was very
indignant. "What is the meaning of this?" he exclaimed, "be-
tween the spring of last year when he defeated <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName>
and this spring I have utterly destroyed the <orgName>Heike</orgName> and without
delay restored the Sacred Mirror and the Sacred Gem to the
Capital. I have, moreover, captured alive the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName>,
the Commander-in-Chief, and his son, and brought them thus far
<pb n="267" xml:id="p281-267"/>

with me as prisoners; so whatever suspicion <persName>Yoritomo</persName> may
harbour about me he ought at least to receive me in audience.
I had thought at least that I might have been appointed <persName>Sotsui-
bushi</persName> of <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, or put in charge of the <placeName>San-in</placeName>, <placeName>Sanyo</placeName>, or
<placeName>Nankai-do</placeName> to consolidate them for him, but instead of that I have
merely been made Governor of the province of <placeName>Iyo</placeName>; and then
instead of being received into <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> I am made to go back
to <placeName>Koshigoe</placeName>. Was not the subduing of the whole land of
<placeName>Nippon</placeName> the work of <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> and myself? Of the sons of the
same father he that is born first is treated as the elder
brother, and those who are born afterwards as the younger, so
that none can deny that it is he that rules the Empire. Who
could doubt it ? "
</p>
<p>
But as all his complaints were unavailing, in tears of despair
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> wrote this letter and sent it to <persName>Ōe Hiromoto</persName> :
</p>
<p>
"With the deepest respect <persName>Minamoto Yoshitsune</persName> pleads his
cause. Having been appointed to represent your lordship, I
have successfully fulfilled the Imperial Edict in subduing the
enemies of the Throne and wiping out our former disgrace.
Far from receiving any reward for these deeds, on account of
some malignant slander all my great merit has been forgotten,
and I have been blamed where I have committed no crime.
Though my great achievements are known to all, yet I am thus
rebuffed and left here many days to weep bitter tears in vain :
and while the truth of the slanders has not been proved, I am
unable to come to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> to say anything in my defense.
Long is it now since I have been permitted to behold your face.
Can it be that our former fraternal relations have now been
severed, that in the destiny that brings them to none effect I am
reaping the reward of the evil karma of a former life? Wretch-
ed that I am! For then, except the revered spirit of our father
were to return to this life, who is there to hearken to my
unavailing lamentation, or who will show me any pity? Irrevalent
as it may seem to refer to such things, since I was born and my
father's early death left me an orphan, so that my mother
<pb n="268" xml:id="p282-268"/>

travelled with me in her arms to <placeName>Uda</placeName> in <placeName>Yamato</placeName>, up till this
moment I have never known an hour of ease. What use to
describe the risks of my sojourn near the Capital, hiding myself
here and there, and fleeing to this and that refuge far removed
from the haunts of men, subject to the very hinds and peasants?
But when, in the new harmony of our brotherly affection, it was
arranged that I should go forth in the campaign against the
<persName>Heike</persName>, since <persName>Kiso Yoshinaka</persName> was overthrown and I set forth to
destroy the whole family, what hardships are there both by land
and sea that I have not undergone? At times spurring my steed
over the towering crags heedless of all danger, at times braving
the perils of the winds and waves of the boundless ocean; careless
whether my body should be lost in the depths of the sea to be a
prey for the great fishes. Moreover my helmet and armour
were my only pillow, the bending of the bow my only business,
while I put away all thought of aught but appeasing the wrath
of our ancestral spirits, the object of my long cherished desire.
Therefore it was no more than suitable to the importance of our
house that <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> should be appointed Go-i-no-Jo. But
now my grief is sore and my lamentation extreme. Except I
turn for aid to the gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName>, to whom can I look to
hear my petition? Still, if I had all the holy amulets of all the
shrines and temples in <placeName>Nippon</placeName>, and took all the gods and
<persName>Buddhas</persName> of the whole land to witness that I held no treachery
in my heart, however many oaths I might swear he would not
forgive me. Our country is the land of the gods; and the gods
will not tolerate impropriety. There is none else on whom I
can rely, so I throw myself on your great charity. I pray you
therefore to bring these things before <persName>Yoritomo</persName> at a suitable
time, and to take such measures that he will perceive that I am
guiltless and pardon me. So shall your house acquire great
merit, and good fortune and prosperity shall follow you from
generation to generation. Thus will my former sadness be done
away, and for a while I shall enjoy tranquillity. I cannot say
all I would in this letter, but must perforce here bring my few
<pb n="269" xml:id="p283-269"/>

words to an end. <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> respectfully addresses you. The
fifth day of the sixth month of the second year of Gen-ryaku.
To <persName>Inaba-no-kami Dono</persName>.

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>THE EXECUTION OF MUNEMORI.</head>
<p>So the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> was brought before <persName>Yoritomo</persName>.
He was placed in a room separated by a courtyard from the one
where the Lord of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> was seated, and opposite to it, so
that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> could scrutinize him from behind his curtain.
Through <persName>Hiki-no-Toshiro Yoshikazu</persName> he greeted him thus:
"Far be it indeed from <persName>Yoritomo</persName> to regard the <orgName>Heike</orgName> family as
his personal enemies, since if it had not been for the favour of
the late <persName>Nyudo Kiyomori</persName> he would not have been alive today.
But some twenty years have passed since then, and seeing that
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> have been declared enemies of the Throne and an
Imperial Edict has been issued for their chastisernent, it was not
possible for me to disobey the Imperial Command, and so it is
that I have the honour of your presence here. I am indeed
pleased to see you before me thus alive and well." When
<persName>Yoshikazu</persName> brought this message to <persName>Munemori</persName> it was regrettable
that he prostrated himself in obeisance.
</p>
<p>
Now among all the fords of all provinces, who were sitting
there in order, were many from the Capital, besides some who
had formerly been retainers of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> house, and there were
none who did not consider this behaviour contemptible.
"Ah,"
said one, "it is this spirit that has brought him to his present
plight. But this low obeisance is hardly likely to save his skin.
If one as great as he was in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> is thus
captured alive, it is quite natural he should be brought down
here." And many agreed with these sentiments, though many
also shed tears of pity. "A fierce tiger when in the mountains
is a terror to all the beasts," observed one of these, "but when
it is in a cage it will wag its tail and beg for food; and so
<pb n="270" xml:id="p284-270"/>

however brave a general may be, when all is lost his courage
will fail him and so it is with this <persName>Daijin</persName>."
</p>
<p>
Now, though the <roleName>Hogwan</roleName> made many representations, yet
owing to the slanders of <persName>Kagetoki</persName>, <persName>Yoritomo</persName> paid no attention
to them, but only gave orders that he should immediately
return again, taking <persName>Munemori</persName> and his son with him and so,
on the ninth day of the sixth month he once more set out with
them for the Capital. Pitiable to relate, <persName>Munemori</persName> was glad to
hear this, for he thought his life would be prolonged, if but for
a day or two. And so, as they went along, wherever they
stopped he wondered if he was to die there. In this way they
passed through several provinces till they came to <placeName>Utsumi</placeName> in
<placeName>Owari</placeName>, and as formerly <persName>Sama-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName> had been
executed here, he expected to meet the same fate, and when
they passed on he felt greatly relieved, hoping that he was
permitted to live after all. His son <persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName>, however,
did not share these hopes, but thought their execution was only
being postponed till they were near the Capital in order that the
heads might not putrefy, seeing that the weather was hot. Out
of pity for his father he said nothing of this to him, but occupied
himself with silently repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term>.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty third day they arrived at <placeName>Shinohara</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Omi</placeName>. Until the day before the father and son had
been kept together, but on the morning of this day they were
separated. <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, who was ever considerate towards
others, had sent on a messenger three days before to summon a
certain holy man famous for his sanctity, named <persName>Honjo-bo
Tanko</persName> of <placeName>Ohara</placeName>. On his arrival <persName>Munemori</persName> enquired of him :
"Where is <persName>Uemoir-no-kami</persName>? If we are to be executed I should
like our bodies to fall on the same mat. Why do they part us
while we are still alive, for seventeen years we have never been
separated even for an hour? The reason why I chose to live
and not die in the <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>, and to expose myself to
the shame of being brought thus to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, was
only for the sake of being with my son." And he burst into
</p>
<p><pb n="271" xml:id="p285-271"/>

tears as he spoke. The priest too was much affected, but
thinking it would not do to break down, wiped away his tears
and composed himself, saying: "Alas, since parental affection
is the same both among high and low, it is natural that your
lordship should feel thus. Since you were born into this world
you have attained to such heights of glory and happiness as
have not been paralleled even in the days of old; rising to be
Chief Minister and Maternal Relative of the Heavenly Sovereign,
and thus draining the cup of earthly greatness: and now that
you have fallen to your present plight, since it is the result of
the karma of a former life, you must feel no resentment against
either the world, or men, or gods, or <persName>Buddhas</persName>. Even the
pleasures of the profound tranquillity of the heaven of <persName>Maha-
brahma</persName> leaves something to be desired; what then shall we say
of this life, evanescent as a flash of lightning or a drop of dew?
Even the hundred million and a thousand years life of the heaven
of <persName>Indra</persName> is but as a dream, so the thirty nine years of your life
till now are but as a moment. Who is there who can taste the
elixir of eternal youth, or who can prolong his days like <persName>Sei-o-
bo</persName> and <persName>To-bo-saku</persName>? Great was the glory of <persName>Shi-kotei</persName> of <placeName>Shin</placeName>,
but he lies buried in his tomb at <placeName>Risan</placeName>: <persName>Butei</persName> of <placeName>Kan</placeName> was
loath to die, but now he rots under the moss of <placeName>Toryo</placeName>. All
who live must surely die; even <persName>S'akaya Muni</persName> could not escape
the smoke of the sandal-wood. When pleasure is at its zenith
then comes pain; and even the angels are not exempt from the
Five Failings. And as <persName>Buddha</persName> says in the <title>Hannya Kyo</title>:
"When the mind is entirely empty, desiring neither evil nor
good, then there is no more hindrance of phenomena; so if we
regard both good and evil as unreal, we shall verily be in accord
with the mind of <persName>Buddha</persName>. And inasmuch as <persName>Amida Nyorai</persName>,
after meditation lasting five kalpas, was at last, after overcoming
all difficulties, able to made the Great Vow, is it not most stupid
and regrettable if we still continue to spend countless myriads
of ages bound to the revolving wheel of births and deaths,
seeing the treasures of salvation spread out before us without
<pb n="272" xml:id="p286-272"/>

lifting a hand to grasp them? Concentrate your whole mind
on these things now." And thus admonishing him, the priest
urged him to repeat the <term>Nembutsu</term>, so <persName>Munemori</persName>, perceiving
that he was indeed a saintly priest, suddenly putting all earthly
thoughts from his mind, turned to the west, and putting his
hands together, in a loud voice repeated the <term>Nembutsu</term>. As he
did so <persName>Kitsu Uma-no-suke Kinnaga</persName> drew his sword and moved
round behind him from the left side to cut off his head, when
<persName>Munemori</persName> suddenly stopped the <term>Nembutsu</term> and enquired: "Is
<persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName> already dead?" At this painful interruption
<persName>Kinnaga</persName> thought the head might fall backwards, but it fell to
the front. At the sad scene both the priest and also the rough
soldiers of the guard could not refrain from weeping. Now this
<persName>Kinnaga</persName> had been a hereditary retainer of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and was
one of the samurai always in attendance on the <persName>Shin-Chunagon
Tomomori-no-Kyo</persName>, and however much people might flatter
those who were in power, he was held in contempt as a samurai
who was quite devoid of fine feeling.
</p>
<p>
Then the priest proceeded to give the same spiritual
comfort to <persName>Uemon-no-kami</persName>, and to urge him too to repeat the
<term>Nembutsu</term>, whereupon he enquired of him how his father had
met his end. "His end was happy," replied the priest, "and
so I pray you set your mind at rest.” "Then I have no more
concern with this fleeting world," said the young noble," so cut
off
my head at once." And stretching out his neck he awaited
the blow, which has struck this time by <persName>Hori-no-Yataro Chika-
tsune</persName>. By the order of <persName>Kinnaga</persName> the corpses of father and son
were buried in the same grave. And this was done because
<persName>Munemori</persName> so earnestly requested it, worldly attachment though
it was.
</p>
<p>
On the twenty fourth day of the same month the heads of
the <persName>Daijin Munemori</persName> and his son were brought into the Capital.
The officials of the <persName>Kebiishi</persName> proceeded to <placeName>Sanjo-kawara</placeName> to
receive them, and then, carrying them along <placeName>Sanjo</placeName> to the
westward, and <placeName>Higashi-no-Do-in</placeName> to the northward, they fixed them
<pb n="273" xml:id="p287-273"/>

to a sandal-wood tree on the left of the prison gate. In other
countries there may be an example of the head of one above the
Third Rank being carried through the streets, but in this
country I have never heard of one. In the period of Heiji the
evil deeds of <persName>Nobuyori-no-Kyo</persName> were such that his head was cut
off, but it was not exposed in the streets. The <persName>Heike</persName> were the
first to be treated thus. When they were brought up from the
<placeName>Western Provinces</placeName> they were paraded along <placeName>Rokujo</placeName> to the east
while they were alive, and when they were sent back from the
<placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName> they were carried along <placeName>Sanjo</placeName> to the west
when dead. Disgraced while alive and dishonoured when dead,
everywhere they were degraded.

<p>Now <persName>Hon-Sammi Chujo Shigehira</persName> had been living since
the last year in the province of <placeName>Izu</placeName> in the charge of <persName>Kano-no-suke Muneshige</persName>, but as the monks of <placeName>Nara</placeName> were always
demanding him, orders were at last sent to <persName>Izu-no-Kurando
Taiyu Yorikane</persName>, grandson of <persName>Gen-sammi Nyudo Yorimasa</persName>, to
escort him thither. On this occasion they did not enter the
Capital, but turned off at <placeName>Otsu</placeName> and took the <placeName>Daigo</placeName> road by
<placeName>Yamashina</placeName>, thus passing near <placeName>Hino</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now the wife of <persName>Shigehira</persName> was the daughter of <persName>Torikai-no-Dainagon Korezane</persName>, who had been adopted by <persName>Gojo-no-Dainagon Kunitsuna</persName>; she was the foster-mother of the late

sent back to the Capital, whereupon she took up her abode with
her elder sister <persName>Taiyu-no-sammi</persName> at a place called <placeName>Hino</placeName>. When
she heard that her husband's life, though trembling to its fall
like the dewdrop on the end of a leaf, was not yet extinguished,
she felt a great longing to see his face once more, but as she
could not, there was nothing left her but to spend her days
weeping and bewailing him.
</p>
<p>
So the <persName>Chujo Shigehira</persName> said to the samurai who were
escorting him: "I am greatly beholden to you for your
consideration and kindness to me so far, and I have just one last
boon to crave. As I have no child, I feel no regret at leaving
this world, but as I hear that my wife, to whom I have been
<pb n="275" xml:id="p289-275"/>

long wedded, is now living at <placeName>Hino</placeName>, I should much like to see
her to speak with her about the hereafter." And as the guards
were not wood or stone, with tears in their eyes they readily
gave him the desired permission.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Shigehira</persName>, greatly delighted, forthwith sent word to the
lady saying: "Is <persName>Dainagon-no-suke-no-Tsubone</persName> within? <persName>Hon-
sammi Chūjo</persName>, who is on his way to <placeName>Nara</placeName>, waits without to see
her." "Where is he then ? Where is he? exclaimed the lady,
running out when she received the message, when she saw a thin,
sunburned figure, clad in a hitatare of dyed blue material and a
folded eboshi, standing by the verandah of the residence.
"How is this? How is this? Is it a dream or is it real? But
come in!" exclaimed his wife, advancing to the edge of the
curtain. As she heard his voice again tears anticipated all else,
and with blinded eyes and sinking heart for a while she found
no word to utter. Then the <persName>Chūjo</persName>, raising the curtain and
leaning half-way through it, thus addressed her in a voice
broken by sobs: "In the spring of last year, after many perils,
as a penalty for my great guilt, I was capturned alive at
<placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, and after being publicly
disgraced in <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, I am to be delivered into
the hands of the priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName> to be put to death. So on my
way thither I wished to see your face again, and now there's
nothing more that I have to live for. I had thought to shave
my head here and leave my hair as a keepsake, but as I have
come in this condition I cannot bear to do so." And pulling a
lock of hair from this forehead, he bit off a piece where it
touched his mouth and handed it to her, saying: "Keep this in
memory of me." His wife, who had been full of anxiety about
him before, was now quite overwhelmed by her grief, and fell
forward with her robe about her face in an agony of tears.
</p>
<p>
After a while, recovering herself somewhat, she said; "It was
my intention to drown myself like the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> and <persName>Kozaisho</persName>,
but indeed when I heard you were still alive I greatly wished to
see you again, and so I have lived till now in this wretched
<pb n="276" xml:id="p290-276"/>

state. Only in the hope of seeing you have I lived so long, and
now this is to be last time." And as they spoke of things both
past and present tears were the only thing that seemed to have
no end. "As you look so languid, will you not change your
garments," she said, producing a wadded silk under-garment
and a white kariginu. So the <persName>Chujo</persName> put them on, and giving
her those that he had just taken off, said: Keep these too as a
memento of me." "Not only that," replied the lady, but I
pray you write me at least a line, that I may treasure it till the
end of my life; and she brought him an inkstone. So the
<persName>Chūjo</persName>, weeping bitterly, took a brush and wrote these lines:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Laying aside this robe I leave it here as a keepsake,</l>
<l>Wet as it is with my tears, pent in my bosom till now."</l>
</lg>
<p>
And the lady also wrote this verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Ah, this robe you have worn, what use can it be to you further?</l>
<l>Tis a memento for me that I shall see you no more."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Since we are bound to each other, we shall surely be
reborn together in the next life," said the <persName>Chūjo</persName>; “pray that it
be upon the same lotus. The times grows late, and I must
haste to <placeName>Nara</placeName>; I must not keep the guards waiting." And he
made to do forth, but the lady clung to his sleeve and held him
back, crying: "Why so soon; stay a little longer! You
can guess what I feel in my heart," replied he, "but my time on
earth grows short; and with firm resolution he turned to
depart. Indeed, when he thought that this would be the last
time in this world, he could with difficulty refrain from turning
back once more, but unwilling to show any weakness, he
conquered his feelings and went on his way.
</p>
<p>
The lady, rolling herself right outside the curtain, lifted up
her voice and wept aloud, so that the sound of it could be heard
far beyond the gate, and the <persName>Chujo</persName>, blinded by his tears and
unable to see the road, for some time did not quicken his pace.
"A pitiable meeting indeed!" he thought regretfully, His wife
<pb n="277" xml:id="p291-277"/>

at first started to run out after him, but seeing that it was of no
avail, threw herself down with her face buried in her robes.
</p>
<p>
Now the monks of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, as soon as they had got
possession of <persName>Shigehira</persName>, held a council to decide what they should do
with him. <persName>Shigehira</persName>, they declared, was the worst kind of
criminal, beyond even the three thousand varieties of the Five
Punishments. Since, under the influence of the most evil and
malignant karma, he was an outlaw and enemy of <persName>Buddha</persName> and
the Law, he must certainly be paraded round the walls of both
the <placeName>Todaiji</placeName> and the <placeName>Kofukuji</placeName> and then be buried alive and have
his head cut off, or else have it sawn off. But the older priests
took objection to this decision, saying that it was too severe a
sentence for men of religion, and that he should be handed over
to the samurai to be beheaded on the bank of the <placeName>Kozu-gawa</placeName>.
And in the end this counsel prevailed, and he was delivered
over to the samurai, who led him out to the bank of the
<placeName>Kozu-gawa</placeName>, where countless myriads of people, including
thousands of priests, besides his guards and other spectators,
had assembled to see him put to death.
</p>
<p>
Now there was a former retainer of the <persName>Chūjo</persName> named
<persName>Muku-no-Uma-no-jo Tomotoki</persName>, and he was also in the service of
the <persName>Hachijo-no-Nyo-in</persName>, who greatly wished to see the last of his
master, so he rode his hardest to the <placeName>Kozu-gawa</placeName> and arrived
just as he was about to be beheaded. Springing from his horse
he pushed his way through the thronging multitudes till he
reached his master's side, and called out:
"Here am I,
<persName>Tomotoki</persName>, come to see the last of my master!" How
admirable is your devotion," replied to <persName>Chujo</persName>, "and now,
<persName>Tomotoki</persName>, since my guilt is so great I should like to worship a
<persName>Buddha</persName> before I die. Can it be done?" "That will not be
difficult," replied <persName>Tomotoki</persName>, and after consulting with the
samurai on guard, he went off to a neighbouring hamlet and
brought back an image of <persName>Buddha</persName>, most fortunately one of
<persName>Amida</persName>. Setting it down on the sand of the river-bed, he drew
out the cord from the sleeve of his kariginu and fastened one
<pb n="278" xml:id="p292-278"/>

end of it to the hand of the <persName>Buddha</persName>, giving the other to the
<persName>Chujo</persName>. Holding it in his hand the <persName>Chujo</persName> turned toward the
<persName>Buddha</persName> and said: "I have heard that though <persName>Devadatta</persName>
committed the Three Transgressions, and burned eighty thous
and collections of <title>Sutras</title>, it was foretold that he should at last
become a <persName>Tenno Nyorai</persName>; and though his crimes were indeed
heinous, yet by virtue of the Holy <title>Sutras</title> his sinful karma was
blotted out, and they became the cause of his entering the way
of salvation. So, that I should have committed this great sin
was by no means a purposeless happening, but was in accordance
with the principle of things. Who that is born in this world can
disregard an Imperial Command, or who among men can be
disobedient to a father's will? <persName>Buddha</persName> is witness of right and
wrong. Therefore is my crime requited on the spot, and my
doom has now come upon me. However boundless and deep
my repentance, yet it is not enough. But the World of the
Three Precious Ones is a world of compassion and mercy,
and many are the paths that lead to salvation. <foreign xml:lang="ja">YUI-EN
KYO-I, GYAKU-SOKU ZE-JUN</foreign>. This text is graved

change my rebellious affinity into right affinity, and so, as I
repeat the last <term>Nembutsu</term>, according to his promise I may
be reborn in the <placeName>Pure Heavenly Land</placeName>." And as he spoke
these words he stretched out his neck and the blow fell; and
though his former deeds had been so evil, yet when they saw
his demeanour at the last, even the thousands of priests and
the soldiers of the guard could not refrain from bedewing their
sleeves. His head was then nailed up over the gate of the
<placeName>Hannyaji</placeName>; and this was done because it was here that he stood
during the battle in the period Jisho when the temples were

burned. When his wife heard what had been done; "If they
have cut off his head," she said, "they will have thrown his
body away somewhere; so go and bring it that the <title>Sutras</title> may
be recited over it." And she sent a litter for it. And as she
had said, they found that his body had been cast away into the
river-bed, and they took it up and put it into the litter and
brought it back to <placeName>Hino</placeName>. Until the day before it had remained
unchanged, but as the weather was hot it had now become
unsightly, so the feelings of the lady when she saw it can be
imagined. The head also was afterwards recovered by the
good offices of <persName>Shunjo-bo</persName>, a priest of the <placeName>Dai-butsu</placeName>, who
obtained the permission of the monks and sent it to <placeName>Hino</placeName>. So
they brought both the head and body to a neighbouring
mountain temple called <placeName>Hokaiji</placeName>, and burned them there, after
which they sent the ashes to <placeName>Koya</placeName>. They also set up a tomb
for him in <placeName>Hino</placeName>, and his wife became a nun and put on black
robes to pray for his happy rebirth in <placeName>Paradise</placeName>.

<head>THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE.</head>
<p>Thus after the <orgName>Heike</orgName> had been overthrown and the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
had come into power, the provinces obeyed their governors,
and the manors were once more at the disposal of their owners,
so that there was peace and security everywhere. Then on the
ninth day of the seventh month at the Hour of the Horse
(noon), there was a very great earthquake which lasted for
some time. Around the Capital near <placeName>Shirakawa</placeName> the six '<placeName>Shoji</placeName> '
temples were all destroyed, and the upper six stories of the
nine-storied pagoda of <placeName>Hosshoji</placeName> were shaken down, while all
but seventeen <term>ken</term> of the <placeName>Sanjusan-gen-do</placeName> of <placeName>Tokucho-ju-in</placeName>
fell down. From the Imperial Palace and the various shrines
and temples to the houses of the common people, all were

<p><pb n="280" xml:id="p294-280"/>

destroyed. The roar of their falling was like thunder, and the
dust that rose up like clouds of smoke. The sky was darkened,
and the light of the sun could not be seen. Old and young
went in fear and trembling, and the Palace officials were at their
wits' end. The provinces both far and near were equally
affected. Mountains crumbled down and filled up the rivers;
the sea surged and the shores were flooded. The ships rocked
about on the waves; and the horses lost their footing on the
ground. The earth split asunder and water gushed out; the
rocks were rent and rolled down into the valleys. If there
is a flood, cannot they escape by fleeing to the hills? And
if there is a fire, even if far from a river, it can be avoided. But
men are not birds that they should fly in theair; neither are
they dragons that they should ride on the clouds: so verily
there is nothing more fearful than a great earthquake. At
<placeName>Shirakawa</placeName> and <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and in the city those who were buried
alive were without number. Among the Four Elements
water, fire, wind and rain are ever harmful, but earth does not
usually do men hurt. But now high and low shut themselves
into their houses, thinking the world was coming to an end, and
whenever the sky roared or the earth shook they said the
<term>Nembutsu</term> and cried aloud. When people of sixty or seventy,
or eighty or ninety declared that the destruction of the world
was a natural thing, but they had not expected it yesterday or
to-day, the young who heard it were beside themselves with
grief.
</p>
<p>
The <persName>Hō-ō</persName> was just then proceeding to <placeName>Imakumano</placeName>, for
it was the season for the offering of flowers, but when he saw
the dead and injured, he hastily got into his Imperial Palanquin
and returned to the <placeName>Rokujo Palace</placeName>, and great was the anxiety
of the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> of his train as they rode beside
him. Setting up a pavilion in the south court of his Palace His
Majesty took up his abode in it.
</p>
<p>
The <roleName>Emperor</roleName> summoned his Phoenix Car and proceeded
to the edge of the lake, while the other Princes sought refuge
</p>
<p><pb n="281" xml:id="p295-281"/>

in different places, some in their palanquins and some in their
cars. Then the Chief Astrologer came running hastily to the
Palace with the information that a great earthquake might be
expected to take place between the Hour of the Boar and the
Hour of the Rat, (10 to 12. p.m.) that evening, whereupon
all were struck with consternation. In former days, in the time
of <persName>Montoku Tenno</persName>, in the great earthquake of the eighth day
of the third month of the period Sai-ko, it is said that the head
of the <persName>Buddha</persName> of <placeName>Todaiji</placeName> fell down; and in that of the second
day of the fourth month of Tengyo that the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> left his
Palace and took up his abode in a fifty foot pavilion that was
erected for him in front of the <placeName>Joneiden</placeName>. As these things
happened in ancient days who can tell how it was? And since
then no such thing has been heard of. But since an <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
of the Ten Virtues had left the Capital and been drowned, and
his Ministers and Courtiers had been captured and brought
back to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, and been beheaded and exposed in the
streets, or separated from their families and exiled to distant
provinces, thoughtful people mourned and lamented, saying
that the wrathful spirits of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> would be the ruin of the
country.

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>CONCERNING THE DYER.</head>
<p>On the twenty second day of the eighth month, <persName>Mongaku
Shōnin</persName> of <placeName>Takao</placeName>, having discovered the real skull of the late
<persName>Sama-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName>, hung it round his neck and set out
for the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, bringing with him also the head
of <persName>Kamada Hyoye</persName> hung round the neck of one of his disciples.
In the seventh month of the fourth year of Jisho he had
brought some skull or other wrapped in white linen and showed
it to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, saying that it was his father's skull, in order
to incite him to rebellion, and he had believed it was truly
so, and had risen and obtained the supremacy. The real one
<pb n="282" xml:id="p296-282"/>

which he had now brought was found thus. A certain dyer, to
whom the late <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> had showed kindness, employing
him for a long time, had begged the head from the <persName>Kebiishi</persName>,
when he saw it buried in front of the prison with no one to say
the death-prayers over it, and thinking that <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, though
now in exile, might very likely emerge and become powerful in
future, and make enquiries about it, he hid it in the temple
of <placeName>Engakuji</placeName> on <placeName>Higashi-yama</placeName>. So when <persName>Mongaku</persName> heard of
this he came down with it to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, bringing the dyer with
him.
</p>
<p>
When <persName>Yoritomo</persName> heard that he was approaching the city
he went out as far as the <placeName>Katase-gawa</placeName> to meet him, and then
returned with him to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> clad in mourning garb. Placing
the priest on the floor above him, he stood in the courtyard
below to receive the head, weeping bitterly the while. And
all the feudal lords, both great and small, who witnessed the
scene, moistened their sleeves with their tears. Then he cut
out a certain steep cliff and built a temple there, that prayers
might be said for the spirit of his father, and he gave it the
name of <placeName>Shochoji-in</placeName>, And when the Court heard of it, <persName>Sashoben
Kanetada</persName> was sent as Imperial Envoy to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> to confer on
the late <persName>Sama-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName> the title of Naidaijin of the
Upper Second Rank. Thus the warlike prowess of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>
not only exalted himself and his house to high honour, but
obtained rank and title for the spirit of his departed parent.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4" xml:id="v12_ch4">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>EXILE OF THE TAIRA DAINAGON.</head>
<p>On the twenty third day of the ninth month a message
came from <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> to the Court that all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> who were
still left in the Capital should be exiled to various provinces.
So the <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada</persName> was sent to <placeName>Noto</placeName>, <persName>Kurando-no-
kami Nobumoto</persName> to <placeName>Sado</placeName>, <persName>Sanuki-no-Chujo Tokizane</persName> to <placeName>Aki</placeName>,
<persName>Hyobu-no-Shoyu Masaakira</persName> to <placeName>Oki</placeName>, <persName>Nii-no-Sozu Zenshin</persName> to
<pb n="283" xml:id="p297-283"/>

<placeName>Awa</placeName>, <persName>Hoshoji-no-Shugyo No-en</persName> to <placeName>Kazusa</placeName>, <persName>Kyoju-bo Ajari
Yu-en</persName> to <placeName>Bingo</placeName> and <persName>Chunagon-no-Risshi Chukai</persName> to <placeName>Musashi</placeName>.
And so they set out on their various journeys with hearts
full of sadness at parting, some for the waves of the <placeName>Western
Sea</placeName>, some for the mists of the <placeName>Eastern Barrier</placeName>, knowing neither
whither they were going nor when they would meet again.
</p>
<p>
Then the <persName>Taira Dainagon Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> betook himself to
<placeName>Yoshida</placeName> to the former <persName>Imperial Consort Kenrei-mon in</persName> and said:
"I have obtained leave from the officials to come and bid you
farewell. I would have wished to have been able to remain
near you in the Capital that I might look after your affairs, but
today I must start for my place of banishment, and how anxious
do I feel in thus going away to be uncertain henceforward of
what will happen to you." And he wept bitterly. "Indeed,"
replied the <persName>ex-Empress</persName>, also in tears, "you are the only one who
is left from our sad past, and when you are gone who will there
be to whom I can look for sympathy?
"
</p>
<p>
Now this <persName>Tokitada-no-Kyo</persName> was the son of <persName>Zo-Sadaijin Toki-
nobu Ko</persName>, and the grandson of <persName>Dewa-no-Zenji Tomonobu</persName>. He
was the elder brother of the late <persName>Kenshun-mon-in</persName>, the maternal
uncle of the late <persName>Emperor Takakura</persName> and the younger brother of
<persName>Hachijo-no-Nii Dono</persName>, the wife of the <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor
Kiyomori</persName>. All ranks and offices were at his disposal, so he
quickly rose to be Dainagon of the Upper Second Rank. and
three times held the office of <persName>Kebiishi-no-Betto</persName>. While he held
this office he arrested all the thieves and robbers and bandits
and pirates of all provinces, and without any enquiry cut off
their arms at the elbow, so that he was given the nickname of
<persName>Aku-Betto</persName>; and when <persName>Hanakata</persName>, the Groom of the Chamber,
came with the Edict of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> demanding the return of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the Three Sacred Treasures, it was this <persName>Tokitada</persName>
that had the characters'<foreign xml:lang="ja">Namikata</foreign>,' branded on his face. For
the sake of his late beloved Consort <persName>Kenshun-mon-in</persName> the <persName>Ho-o</persName>
had wished to show him favour, but this insult angered him
greatly. The <persName>Hōgwan</persName> too, on account of their intimate rela-

tionship, did all he could for him, but it was of no avail, and so
he was banished. His son <persName>Jiju Tokiie</persName>, who was then sixteen
years old, escaped banishment and was living with his uncle
<persName>Saisho Tokimitsu</persName>, but the day before his father went into exile
he went to his residence, and with his mother <persName>Sotsu-no-suke</persName>
clung to his father's sleeve in his sorrow at being separated from
him. 'We must part at last anyhow; " said the <persName>Dainagon</persName>
coldly, though indeed he was much affected. And so, growing
old and feeble as he was, he had perforce to part from his beloved
wife and son, and start out from the Capital he knew so well,
looking back longingly at the Court as he began his journey to
the <placeName>Northern Provinces</placeName>, of which as yet he knew but the name.
And so he went on past <placeName>Shiga</placeName> and <placeName>Karasaki</placeName>, the bay of <placeName>Mano</placeName>
and the beach of <placeName>Katada</placeName>; and here the <persName>Dainagon</persName> with tears in
his eyes composed these lines;
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Hardly again shall I see them casting the nets at <placeName>Katata</placeName>,</l>
<l>Dripping with shining drops, like to the tears in my eyes.'</l>
</lg>
<p>
Yesterday tossing in a small boat on the waves of the <placeName>Western
Sea</placeName> with his load of anguish and resentment, today, buried under
the snows of the <placeName>North Country</placeName>, his sorrow at parting piling up
high as the clouds of his native Capital.

<p>Now there were ten <persName>Daimyos</persName> who had been accompanying
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> by the orders of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, but when they found he
was under suspicion, they took counsel together and one by one

overthrown the <orgName>Heike</orgName> from <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> to <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName>, and
restored the Sacred Mirror and the Sacred Gem without delay
to the Capital, bringing peace and tranquillity to the whole realm,

and wondered what could be the reason that he was thus sus-

pected, and consequently distrusted everybody from the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>
to the common people, until he afterwards learned that it was
owing to the continued slanders of <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, who hated him on
account of the ridicule he had sustained in the matter of the oar
that spring at <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Yoritomo</persName> wished to strike at <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> quickly
before he could gather any force together, but thought that if he
sent his <persName>Daimyos</persName> with an army, the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> would certainly
destroy the bridges at <placeName>Uji</placeName> and <placeName>Seta</placeName>, and then the Capitai would
be thrown into an uproar once more, which would be no good
thing. So, after long consideration he summoned <persName>Tosa-bo
Shoshun</persName> and said; "Do you go up to the Capital as if on
pilgrimage, and smite him privily." So <persName>Tosa-bo</persName> made obeisance
and immediately started off for <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, without even returning to
own residence. On the twenty ninth day of the ninth month he
arrived there. but as by the day after he had not visited the
<persName>Hōgwan's</persName> residence, <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, who had heard that he had
come to the city, sent <persName>Musashi-bo Benkei</persName> to fetch him.
</p>
<p>
When he was brought into his presence <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>
enquired: "How now, <persName>Tosa-bo</persName>? Have you no letter from <persName>Kama-
kura Dono</persName>? "I have brought no letter with me," replied
<persName>Tosa-bo</persName>, "but the lord of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> gave me this message by
word of mouth. Tell <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> that, since he is in <placeName>Miyako</placeName>,
everything is quiet and there is nothing special to be done,
but he must take every care to keep a strict guard."
"That
is not likely," retorted the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>. "You have been sent
here to assassinate me. If he had sent his <persName>Daimyos</persName> with an army
he thought I should have destroyed the bridges at <placeName>Uji</placeName> and <placeName>Seta</placeName>,
and that would have caused an uproar in the Capital, which
would have been a very bad thing; so he sent you as if on a
pilgrimage to smite me privily, did he not ? "
"Why does your
lordship speak in this way?" replied <persName>Tosa-bo</persName>, greatly astonished,
"it is because of a trifling vow that I have at <placeName>Kumano</placeName> that I
have come up to the Capital." "What do you think of
my not
being permitted to enter <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> on account of <persName>Kagetoki's</persName>
<pb n="286" xml:id="p300-286"/>

slanders, and then being driven back here, <persName>Tosa-bo</persName>?" continued
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. "About that affair I have no knowledge," replied
the priest, "but I have not the least evil design against your
lordship." And he offered to take a written oath that he meant
no harm.
</p>
<p>
"Whatever you do," said the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, "I know
you are in favour with <persName>Yoritomo</persName>." So, as things looked very
black against him, to avert the present danger <persName>Tosa-bo</persName> then and
there wrote seven oaths, and some of these he burned and drank
mixed with water, and some he deposited in the sanctuary of a
shrine, after which he went back and 'gathered together samurai
from various provinces who had come up to the Capital on guard
duty, with the intention of making his attack on the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>
that very night.
</p>
<p>
Now there was a girl named <persName>Shizuka</persName>, the daughter of a
<term>Shirabyoshi</term> called <persName>Iso-no-Zenji</persName>, whom <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> greatly loved,
and she did not depart from his side either by night or day.
And she now warned <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> saying: "The streets are full
of soldiers, and there seems no reason for the city guards to be
in this commotion, for they have not been mustered by your
orders. I think it must be the work of that priest who swore
his oaths here today; would it not be well to send someone to
find out?" So the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> sent two of the three or four boy
attendants of the late <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor</persName>, whom he had
retained in his service, to see what was toward, but though he waited
some time they did not return. Then, thinking that it would
be safer to send a woman, he bade one of his maid-servants go
and see, and after a while she came running back saying: "Two
youths who look like the boy attendants are lying dead in front
of the gate of <persName>Tosa-bo's</persName> residence, and a lot of horses are
standing there ready saddled, and a war pavilion has been pitched
there, in which a number of warriors are mustered, helmeted
and in full armour, with their bows bent and arrows ready on
their backs, all prepared for an instant attack. They do not
look at all like peaceful pilgrims." At this the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> snatched
up his sword and ran out, while <persName>Shizuka</persName> seized his armour and
<pb n="287" xml:id="p301-287"/>

flung it over his shoulders, but without waiting till it was more
than half buckled on, he ran out to the middle gate, where his
horse was standing ready saddled. Springing on to it; "Open
the gate;" he shouted, and as it was opened and he stood
expecting the foe every moment, at midnight <persName>Tosa-bo</persName> rode up
to the front gate with fifty horsemen, all similarly accoutred,
shouting their war-cry. Rising in his stirrups the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>
shouted in a loud voice: "Let us see who there is in all <placeName>Nippon</placeName>
who can best <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> in battle either by night or by day!"
And he rode at them right and left, so that, fearing to be ridden
down, they parted asunder and let him through.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Ise-no'Saburo Yoshimori</persName>, <persName>Mutsu-no-Sato Shiro-byoye
Tadanobu</persName>, <persName>Eda-no-Genzo</persName>, <persName>Kumai-no-Taro</persName>, <persName>Musashi-bo Benkei</persName>,
and the rest of the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> men, all matchless in battle, hearing
that an attack was being made on their master's residence, came
running from their lodgings in all directions, and soon formed a
band of some sixty or seventy horsemen, so that, though <persName>Tosa-bo</persName>
and his men attacked fiercely, they were quickly routed without
difficulty and many slain. <persName>Tosa-bo</persName> himself, seeing that all was
lost, managed to escape somehow or other to the recesses of
Mount <placeName>Kurama</placeName>; but as <placeName>Kurama</placeName> was an old haunt of <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>,
he was soon caught, and brought to the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> residence the
next day. He had hidden himself in a place called <placeName>Sojo-ga-tani</placeName>.
He was clad in a hitatare of dyed cloth, and wore a suit or
armour laced with black leather, with a <term>Tokin</term> or cowl on his
head. Standing on the verandah, the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> thus addressed
him as he was led into the courtyard beneath: "How now,
<persName>Tosa-bo</persName>! You have not been long in going back on your
oath." "As I swore it to suit my convenience, indeed I have
not; " replied the priest."That you should regard your lord's
behest so loyally, and your own life so lightly, is truly
admirable;" replied the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>, with tears streaming down his face;
'look here, sir priest, if you care for your life I will spare it and
send you back to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>.” "This is indeed an unlooked
for kindness," replied <persName>Tosa-bo</persName>, making a low obeisance, "but
<pb n="288" xml:id="p302-288"/>

even if I should be willing, would my lord allow me to live?
Since I am one of his priests, from the time that he specially
chose me for this mission my life has been forfeit to him, and I
know not if he will give it back to me. So the best kindness
you can do me is to take off my head at once."
So they took
him out to the <placeName>Rokujo-kawara</placeName> and there beheaded him: and
there was none who did not praise his conduct.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6" xml:id="v12_ch6">
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>THE HOGWAN LEAVES THE CAPITAL.</head>
<p>Now there was an inferior retainer named <persName>Adachi-no-Shin-
saburo</persName>, whom <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had sent to <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> saying: "He
is only a common servant, but he is a very clever fellow; so
please employ him." And this was in order that he might see
all that <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> did, and report it to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>. So when he
saw how <persName>Tosa bo</persName> had been executed, he fled with all speed to
<placeName>Kamakura</placeName> and told the news. Then <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, greatly
surprised, sent for his younger brother <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Noriyori</persName> and
bade him lead an expedition against <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, and he, though
he declined many times, and pleaded that he was not capable of
the undertaking, was at last fain to consent, and after making
hasty preparations presented himself before <persName>Yoritomo</persName> to say
farewell. "You too had better be careful not to behave like
<persName>Kuro</persName>;" said <persName>Yoritomo</persName> to him, and this so alarmed him that he
returned to his residence and took off his armour, and changed
his mind about going to the Capital. In order to convince his
brother of his innocence of any disloyalty, he wrote every day
ten oaths to that effect, and read them out every evening in the
courtyard before <persName>Yoritomo's</persName> mansion; so in a hundred days he
wrote a thousand oaths, but all to no purpose, for <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had
him put to death at last.
</p>
<p>
Then <persName>Yoritomo</persName> sent a force of sixty thousand horsemen
under the command of <persName>Hojo-no-Shiro Tokimasa</persName> against <persName>Yoshi-
tsune</persName> in the Capital, and when the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> heard of it he at
<pb n="289" xml:id="p303-289"/>

first thought of destroying the bridges at <placeName>Uji</placeName> and <placeName>Seta</placeName> and
resisting their advance, but instead of that he asked <persName>Ogata-no-Saburo Koreyoshi</persName>, who had commanded a sufficiently large
force to prevent the <orgName>Heike</orgName> from entering <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, to permit him
to take refuge in that island. "If you will hand over to me for
execution my old enemy <persName>Kikuchi-no-Jiro Takanao</persName>, who is now
in your house, I will gladly do so;" replied <persName>Ogata</persName>, and upon
the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> readily consenting, he took him out to the <placeName>Rokujo-
kawara</placeName> and beheaded him, after which he agreed to serve
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName>.
</p>
<p>
So on the second day of the eleventh month <persName>Kuro Taiyu
Hōgwan Yoshitsune</persName> proceeded to the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and
presented this petition by the hand of <persName>Okura-no-Kyo Yasutsune
Ason</persName>: "Owing to the slanders of his retainers <persName>Yoritomo</persName> has
given orders that I am to be put to death, and I had at first
thought of destroying the bridges at <placeName>Uji</placeName> and <placeName>Seta</placeName> and holding
out against him, but to act thus would cause a tumult in
the Capital, and that would be a very great misfortune. So I
wish to retire for a while to <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, and beg of His Majesty a
Letter of Permission to do so." At this the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was much
troubled to know what to do, so he enquired of all the <persName>Courtiers</persName>
what they thought. "If <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> remains in the Capital,"
they said, "we shall have a great army from the <placeName>Eastern Pro-
vinces</placeName> breaking into the city and despoiling it, and there will be
no end to the confusion; but if he retires for a while to <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>,
we shall not have this to fear." So a Letter was issued from
the <persName>Ho-o's</persName> Court to <persName>Ogata-no-Saburo Koreyoshi</persName>, and also to
the clans of <persName>Usuki</persName>, <persName>Hetsuki</persName> and <persName>Matsuura</persName>, that they should all
place themselves at the disposal of <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>; and on the third
day at the Hour of the Hare (6 a.m.), without causing the least
trouble or disturbance in the Capital, he rode away with a force
of some five hundred horse.
</p>
<p>
Now when <persName>Ota-no-Taro Yorimoto</persName> of the <persName>Settsu Genji</persName> heard
this he said to himself: "If I let one who is at variance with
him pass by my gate quite freely, it will not be well for me when
<pb n="290" xml:id="p304-290"/>

<persName>Yoritomo</persName> hears of it, so I had better draw bow against him."
And he rode out with the sixty horsemen of his force to a place
called <placeName>Kawarazu</placeName> to attack the <persName>Hōgwan</persName>. Then the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName>
men, turning and enveloping <persName>Ota</persName> and his sixty horsemen in their
midst, set upon them with all their might, determined to let none
escape, and when most of his men were slain, and he himself
wounded and his horse shot through the belly, <persName>Ota</persName> himself
was forced to seek safety in flight. (So <persName>Yoshitsune's</persName> men cut off
the heads of the twenty or so who had been left to hold the
rear, and made a celebration in honour of the God of War,
raising a joyous shout in their pleasure at such an auspicious
beginning to their journey.) That day they arrived at <placeName>Daimotsu-no-ura</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, and on the next day they took
ship from thence, but the west wind blew with such violence.
that the <persName>Hōgwan's</persName> ship was driven on to the shore of <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName>,
and from there he fled and concealed himself in the mountains of
<placeName>Yoshino</placeName>. There he was attacked by the monks of that place
and again fled to <placeName>Nara</placeName>, but as the <placeName>Nara</placeName> monks were also hostile
he returned again to the Capital and eventually sought refuge in
the province of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
Now the ten ladies whom the <persName>Hōgwan</persName> had brought with
him from the Capital had had to be abandoned on the shore at
<placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName>, and they threw themselves down in despair on the
sandy beach under the pines, and as they lay there pillowed on
their long sleeves and with their hakamas all in disorder, the
priests of the <placeName>Sumiyoshi</placeName> shrine took compassion on them, and
putting them into litters sent them back to the Capital. As for
the ships in which <persName>Ogata-no-Saburo Koreyoshi</persName>, on whom <persName>Yoshi-
tsune</persName> chiefly relied, <persName>Shida-no-Saburo Zenjo Yoshinori</persName>, <persName>Bizen-no-
kami Yukiie</persName> and the rest embarked, they were cast hither and
thither on various shores and islands, so that none knew what
had become of the others. And this west wind that blew so
fiercely was said to be caused by the angry spirits of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.
</p>
<p>
On the seventh day of the same month <persName>Hojo-no-Shiro Toki-
masa</persName> arrived at Capital, and on the following day he proceeded
<pb n="291" xml:id="p305-291"/>

to the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and petitioned:
"<persName>Yoritomo</persName> begs
that an Imperial Rescript he issued for the smiting of <persName>Iyo-no-
kami Minamoto Yoshitsune</persName>, <persName>Bizen-no-kami Yukiie</persName> and <persName>Shida-no-Saburo Zenjo Yoshinori</persName>." And His Majesty was not long
before he complied.
</p>
<p>
Thus on the second day, at the request of <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, a
Letter was issued by the Court in opposition to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, and
on the eighth day, at the request of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, an Imperial Edict
was issued to smite <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>. One thing was done in the
morning and another at night, and the Empire was in a lamentable
state of suspense.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7" xml:id="v12_ch7">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>YOSHIDA DAINAGON.</head>
<p>So the former <persName>Uhyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>,
having now become <persName>Sotsui-bushi</persName> of the whole land of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>,
sent a request to the Court that he might levy a tax of so much
rice on every <term>tan</term> of land in the country for the rations of his
soldiers. "From of old," replied the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, "we see it written
in the <title>Muryo-gikyo</title> that whosoever should subdue the enemies of
the Throne should receive half the country, but even so it is not
easy to grant it. <persName>Yoritomo's</persName> demand is excessive." But when
he gathered the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and they held a council about the
matter they decided thus: "What <persName>Yoritomo Kyo</persName> says is half
right." So, as all the <persName>Courtiers</persName> were unanimous, the <persName>Ho-o</persName>
could do nothing, and after a while gave his consent. Then
<term>Shugo</term> or Wardens were placed in all provinces, and <term>Jito</term> or
Lords in all manors, and in this way no one was able to conceal
so much as a single hair.
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><title>Muryo-gi-kyo</title>. Part of the <title>Hokke-kyo</title>. But it is doubtful if such a statement
si to be found in it.</note>
<p>
Now, though he had many adherents among the <persName>Courtiers</persName>,
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> entrusted this matter and other such things to <persName>Yoshida-
<pb n="292" xml:id="p306-292"/>

no-Dainagon Tsunefusa-no-Kyo</persName>. And this <persName>Dainagon</persName> was said
to be a very fine character. For when the <orgName>Genji</orgName> came into
power, those of the Court who had been closely connected with
the <orgName>Heike</orgName> sent letters and messengers, and in various ways tried
to curry favour with them, but this <persName>Dainagon</persName> alone did no such
thing. And in the days of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, when the <persName>Ho-o</persName> was
confined in the <placeName>Seinan Detached Palace</placeName>, it was this <persName>Dainagon</persName> and
<persName>Hachijo-no-Chunagon Nagakata-no-Kyo</persName> who were appointed
<persName>Bettos</persName> of the Palace. He was the son of <persName>Gon-no-Uchuben
Mitsufusa-no-Ason</persName>, and when he was but twelve years old his
father died and left him an orphan, but he rose in rank and
office without any check, being <persName>Kurando</persName> of the Fifth Rank,
<persName>Emon-no-kami</persName> and <persName>Benkwan</persName> at once, after which he became
successively <persName>Kurando-no-kami</persName>, <persName>Sangi</persName>, <persName>Daiben</persName>, <persName>Dazai-no-Sotsu</persName>,
<persName>Chunagon</persName>, and then <persName>Dainagon</persName>. He passed over the heads of
many others, but was never himself passed over. People's good
and evil deeds cannot be hid, as a gimlet goes through a bag.
He was indeed a greatly respected <persName>Dainagon</persName>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8" xml:id="v12_ch8">
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>CONCERNING ROKUDAI.</head>
<p>Now <persName>Hojo-no-Shiro Tokimasa</persName> was made Warden of <placeName>Miyako</placeName>
to represent <persName>Yoritomo</persName> there, and in order that none of the male
posterity of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> should escape him, he made proclamation
that anyone, high or low, who could give him any information
as to their whereabouts, should receive whatever he might wish.
And, regrettable to say, many in the Capital, anxious to gain
rewards, made search and gave information, so that many were
discovered. So much so that they seized upon even the children
of the lowest servants, if they were handsome and of fair
complexion, declaring: "This is the son of such and such a <persName>Chujo</persName>,
or: "This is the heir of such and such a <persName>Shosho</persName>:" and when
the mother or father wept and lamented, they would say: "The
foster-mother has said so;" or: "His nurse has told us: and
<pb n="293" xml:id="p307-293"/>

if they were quite young children they would be thrown into the
water or buried alive, or if they were older they would be
strangled or stabbed, so that the grief and lamentation of their mothers
and foster-mothers was beyond compare. <persName>Hojo</persName> himself was
pained at this wholesale slaughter, but as he had to obey orders
he could do nothing.
</p>
<p>
Among these descendants was <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>, the heir
of <persName>Komatsu-no-sammi-no-Chujo Koremori-no-Kyo</persName>, who was
now growing up, and as he was the grandson and heir,
he searched everywhere to try and find him and put him
to death, but all to no effect, and he was just about to
return to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> with his purpose unfulfilled, when a
certain woman came to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and said: "Westward from
here, at a place called <placeName>Shobu-dani</placeName>, to the north of the
mountain temple of <placeName>Daigakuji</placeName> which lies behind <placeName>Henjoji</placeName>, the
wife and children of <persName>Komatsu-no-sammi-no-Chujo Koremori</persName>
are in hiding." <persName>Hojo</persName> was exceedingly pleased to hear this, and
immediately sent someone to spy out the place. Going thither
he found that in a certain temple building there were several
women and children carefully concealed, and as he peeped
through a chink in the fence he saw a white puppy run out,
followed by a very handsome boy; then a woman who looked
like his foster-mother came out hurriedly and drew him in again,
exclaiming : "How terrible if anyone should see you!
" This
is certainly he, thought the spy, as he hastened back and told
what he had seen, and the next day <persName>Hojo</persName> surrounded <placeName>Shobu-
dani</placeName> with soldiers and sent a messenger to the temple saying:
"I have heard that <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>, the son of <persName>Komatsu-no-
sammi Chujo Koremori</persName>, is in this place, and <persName>Hojo-no-Shiro
Tokimasa</persName>, the representative of <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName>, wishes to see
him, so please bring him forth at once." When his mother heard
this her senses reeled so that for a while she knew nothing, and
<persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName>, the child's two faithful retainers, tried
to find some way to escape with him, but when they saw the
soldiers surrounding them on all sides, they knew it was no use.
<pb n="294" xml:id="p308-294"/>

</p>
<p>
Then his mother, holding the child in her arms, wept and
lamented aloud, crying: "Kill me too!" And the
fostermother and the other ladies, falling down in front of her, added
their voices to the sad chorus. For a long time they had kept
quiet and had not raised their voices above a whisper for fear
of discovery, but now all in the house wept and wailed loudly
with one accord. Now <persName>Hojo</persName> was neither wood nor stone, and
tears rose to his eyes as he stood waiting within hearing of the
scene.
Repressing his emotion he sent another messenger
saying: "As the land is not yet quiet and safe, some violence
might befall you, so <persName>Tokimasa</persName> himself has come to fetch the
child. There is nothing to fear, so I pray you let him come
at once." At this the child said to his mother: "As there
is no help for it, it were better to send me at once, for otherwise
the soldiers will break in to search for me, and that will be
much worse; and even if I do go, I can soon ask leave of this
<persName>Hojo</persName> to let me come back again. So do not grieve so much."
And while he tried to comfort her thus, as it must be, his
mother dressed him and smoothed his hair, weeping as she did
so, and just before he started she put into his hand a beautiful
little rosary of black wood, saying: " Take this, and be sure
you repeat the <term>Nembutsu</term> as often as you can, that you may go
to <placeName>Paradise</placeName>." "Since I must part with you to-day, “replied
the boy as he took it," I wish if possible to go where my
father is." At this his younger sister, who was about ten years
old, cried out also: "I too want to go and see my father;
and she ran out after him, so that the foster-mother had to hold
her back. <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName> was twelve years old, but looked
more grown up than most boys of fourteen or fifteen, and was
very handsome and charming in his disposition. He tried
hard to show a bold front to the enemy, but his tears ran
down under the sleeve that he pressed to his face as he got into
the palanquin, which then moved off surrounded by soldiers on
all sides. <persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName> walked on each side
of their young master, and though <persName>Hojo</persName> made two of his men
<pb n="295" xml:id="p309-295"/>

get off their horses for them to ride, they declined, and walked
barefoot all the way from <placeName>Daigakuji</placeName> to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName>. His mother
and the other lady flung themselves on the ground, gazing up to
heaven in an agony of longing.
</p>
<p>
Presently his mother said to the nurse: "They say that
the children of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> are being sought out and put to death
in various ways, some being drowned, and others buried, or
strangled, or stabbed. I wonder how they will deal with our
boy. As he is rather grown up I think they will certainly
behead him. I have often seen children put out to nurse with
foster-mothers, and even then parental affection is still strong;
how much more when we have always kept our child with
us ever since he was born, and never let him out of our sight for
a minute, but his father and I have brought him up ourselves,
regarding him as quite different from other children, and so
when I was thus untimely bereft of his father, I had these two
left to comfort me; and now, alas! I have only one. Ah, what
shall I do? For these last three years I have never been free
from anxiety, even for an hour, and though it was what I was
expecting, yet I did not think it would come thus yesterday or
to-day. You know how I have always relied on the power
of <persName>Kwannon</persName> of <placeName>Hase</placeName>; and yet I must suffer his being snatched
away from me like this. And they will not suffer him to live
long!"
And so she continued her plaint, pressing her sleeve
to her face and sobbing incessantly. Even when night came
her grief choked her throat and prevented her even from
dozing, but after a while she said to the nurse: "Just now
I fell to sleep for a moment and in a dream I saw my boy
coming to me, riding on a white horse, and he came to my side
and sat down respectfully, saying that he had got leave to come
as he longed to see me so much; but then, to my great regret
I started up suddenly, and when I searched beside me there
was no one there. How short is a dream indeed, and how
painful is the awaking." And the tears ran down her cheeks as
she related it.
</p>
<p><pb n="296" xml:id="p310-296"/>

Thus the long night dragged by, and she ceased not to
moisten her couch with her tears. But as all things must come
to an end, at last the night-watchman proclaimed the opening
dawn, and as it broke, <persName>Saito Roku</persName> came back, and in answer
to the anxious enquiry of the lady, told her that the child
was quite safe and had sent her a letter. Opening it she read
as follows: "Thus far I am quite safe, but still I fear you
must be very anxious. Please give my love to everybody."
And when she read his words, written in such a manly style, she
pressed the letter to her face without a word, and then cast
herself on the ground with her head in her robe. As she
remained thus for some time without stirring, <persName>Saito Roku</persName>
said: "Things are uncertain, even for an hour, so pray give
me an answer that I may go back." So the lady, weeping,
wrote a reply and gave it to him, and he bade her farewell and
departed.
</p>
<p>
Then the foster-mother, impelled by restlessness or spirit,
wandered out of the <placeName>Daigakuji</placeName> and was walking about aimlessly
in the vicinity, weeping as she went, when she met someone who
told her that behind there dwelt a priest of the mountain temple
of <placeName>Takao</placeName>, called <persName>Mongaku-bo</persName>, who was very much trusted by
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> in all matters, and that he wished to find a son of
some Court lady to become his disciple. At this she was
overjoyed, and at once making her way to <placeName>Takao</placeName>, she begged
to see <persName>Mongaku</persName> and thus addressed him, weeping bitterly the
while : 'My young lord, whom I have carried in my arms
since he was born, and who is now twelve years old, was
yesterday carried away by the soldiers.
Could not your
reverence beg his life, and bring him up as your disciple?"
And she fell down before the monk, weeping unrestrainedly, so
that he knew not what to do.
</p>
<p>
Feeling compassion for her distress he asked her who
the boy was. "It is the beloved child of the wife of <persName>Komatsu-no-sammi Chujo Koremori-no-Kyo</persName>," she replied, “and we were
bringing him up, but somebody must have said that he was the
<pb n="297" xml:id="p311-297"/>

son of the <persName>Chujo</persName>, so yesterday the soldiers came and took
him." "Who was the warrior who took him? asked the
priest. "He said his name was <persName>Hojo-no-Shiro Tokimasa</persName>; "
replied the lady. "Well I will go and see him;
"' declared
<persName>Mongaku</persName>, and he went off there and then. At this the lady,
though she did not entirely trust in the monk, felt somewhat
relieved from the intense anxiety that had possessed her since the
child was taken, and immediately hurried back to <placeName>Daigakuji</placeName>.
"I thought you had gone somewhere to drown yourself," said the
child's mother, "and I too was thinking I would like to
throw myself into some river or other;" and then, in answer
to her questions the nurse told her in detail all that she had
done, and what the priest had said. “Ah, if the priest could
beg his life, and bring him here so that I could see him once
again!" she exclaimed, and her unceasing tears were this time
tears of joy.
</p>
<p>
So the priest went to <placeName>Rokuhara</placeName> and asked about the
matter. "It is the order of <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName>," said <persName>Hojo</persName>,
"that every one of the male descendants of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> should
be sought out and put to death, and among them is <persName>Rokudai
Gozen</persName>, son of <persName>Komatsu-no-Chujo Koremori</persName>. As he is growing
up, and is moreover the last of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> line, his mother
being, it is said, the daughter of the late <persName>Naka-no-Mikado
Shin-Dainagon Narichika-no-Kyo</persName>, I had special orders to take
him and put him out of the way, but though I managed to find
others of the family I could not find him by any means, and was
going back to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> empty-handed, when unexpectedly I
received news of him the day before yesterday, and yesterday went
and brought him here; but indeed he is such a beautiful child
that I am sorry I did not leave him where he was."
"Well, may
I see him?" asked <persName>Mongaku</persName>, and when he was taken to where
the child was, he found him dressed in a double embroidered
hitatare, holding in his hand the rosary of black wood. Such
was the beauty of his hair and the elegance and nobility of his
form and bearing, that he hardly looked like a creature of this
<pb n="298" xml:id="p312-298"/>

world at all. Though his face was a little thin, and he had
perchance not slept much that night, yet he looked indeed very
loveable.
</p>
<p>
When the child caught sight of the priest his eyes filled with
tears for some reason or other, and <persName>Mongaku</persName> too moistened the
sleeve of his black robe. "However great an enemy he might
become in the future," he thought "how could anyone put him
to death now?" Then, turning to <persName>Hojo</persName>, he said:
"It is no
doubt a matter connected with a previous existence, but when I
consider this child I am filled with a great pity for him. Will
you not grant him a reprieve for twenty days, while I go down
to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> and obtain a pardon for him? When I went up
to the Capital in former days to procure an Imperial Edict to
establish the position of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, as I travelled all night through
the plains around the <placeName>Fujikawa</placeName>, I lost my way and was nearly
washed
away and drowned, and then after that I met with
robbers in <placeName>Mount Takashi</placeName>, and barely escaping with my life managed
to effect an entrance into the '<placeName>Prison Palace</placeName>' of <placeName>Fukuhara</placeName> and
receive the Edict from the <persName>Ho-o</persName>. In recognition of this service
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> promised that whatever request I might make of him
at any time, he would surely grant it, and moreover I have done
him many important services since then. It is no new thing that
I say, but as I have valued my duty more than my life, <persName>Yoritomo</persName>
will not forget it, unless his high position has puffed him up.”
And he set out for <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> at the dawn of that day.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName>, regarding the monk as a living
<persName>Buddha</persName> indeed, pressed their hands together and wept. They
then returned to <placeName>Daigakuji</placeName> and acquainted the child's mother
with all that had happened, to her very great joy. With regard
to the decision of <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, they were in suspense as to what it
would be, but were cheered by his life being spared for twenty
days, and ascribing it to the power of <persName>Kwannon</persName> of <placeName>Hase</placeName>, they
put their trust in that deity. So things went on, and the twenty
days sped by like a dream, but the monk did not come back.
"How can this be?" they said with sinking hearts, and all their
<pb n="299" xml:id="p313-299"/>

grief and anxiety assailed them once again. <persName>Hojo</persName> also, as the
twenty days that he had agreed to wait had passed, thought that
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> had probably refused the pardon, and fretted
impatiently at the delay, for he wished to start immediately for <placeName>Kama-
kura</placeName>. <persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName> wrung their hands in despair,
but as the monk had not returned, neither had he sent any
messenger, they knew not what to think. So they went out to
<placeName>Daigakuji</placeName> and reported, with tears streaming down their cheeks,
that the monk had not come back and that <persName>Hojo</persName> was to start at
break of day. The two ladies, who had felt very much cheered
when the priest started out so hopefully, and who had also relied
on the help of <persName>Kwannon</persName>, now began to lose heart again, as was
but natural. "Is there not some virtuous old man, "said the
`mother to the nurse," who could be found to take him to meet
the monk on the road; for how terrible if he were to come back
with the pardon after the child had already been put to death.
What will they do? Do they mean to kill him soon?" 'It
looks as though they would do so at dawn," replied one of the
two, "owing to the behaviour of Hojo's retainers in his residence.
For in their pity and reluctance for such work some of them are
weeping and some repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term>." "And how is the
child looking?" asked his mother. "When anyone goes to see
him, he seems quite unconcerned, telling his rosary, but when
no one is looking he presses his sleeve to his face and weeps ;
replied the retainer. "That is just like him," said his mother,
"he is still young in years, but he has the heart of a man
already; if there had been time I would have asked <persName>Hojo</persName> to
give him leave to come back here once again, but today is
already past the twentieth day, so I shall not be able to come to
him or he to me. And I know not when I shall see him again ;
so how wretched must he be, thinking that tonight will be his
last. And you, how will you fare?" We will stay with
him to the last, and if the worst happens, we will take his bones
and bring them to the <placeName>Holy Mount of Koya</placeName>, and then we will
renounce the world and follow the Way, that we may pray for
<pb n="300" xml:id="p314-300"/>

his happiness in the future life." And they sank down on the
ground choked with tears. Then as the time grew late his
mother said: "As matters are so uncertain, I pray you go
back immediately; " so, weeping bitterly, they took leave and
went.
</p>
<p>
So at dawn on the seventeenth day of the twelfth month
<persName>Hojo-no-Shiro Tokimasa</persName> took the child <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName> and
departed from <placeName>Miyako</placeName>. <persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName> went with
him, walking on each side of the palanquin. Again <persName>Hojo</persName> bade
two of his men dismount that they might ride, but they declined
saying: "As it is the last time we are quite content;
" and so
they went their way barefoot, weeping tears of blood. Thus
pitifully parted from his mother and nurse, looking back on the
Imperial City as it lay beyond the clouds, as for the last time he
set out on the road to the far-off <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, the state of
the child's feelings can well be imagined. If one of the samurai
quickened his pace, his heart sank, thinking he was coming to
cut off his head; and if one of them chanced to speak to him:
"Now is the end," he would guess in dismay. He thought it
might be at <placeName>Shi-no-miya-kawara</placeName>, but they passed on through
<placeName>Sekiyama</placeName> and came to the beach of <placeName>Otsu</placeName>. He wondered if it
would not be at <placeName>Awazu-no-hara</placeName>, but by that time the dusk had
already fallen. And so they went on, station by station and
province by province until they came to the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName>,
where it seemed that his fleeting life would end.
</p>
<p>
At a place called <placeName>Sembon-no-matsubara</placeName> the palanquin was
set down and the young lord ordered to get out, a leather mat
being spread for him to sit on. Then <persName>Hojo</persName> hastily sprang from
his horse, and approaching the child spoke as follows: "I have
brought you thus far because I thought we might meet the monk
on the way, but if I take you over the <placeName>Hakone</placeName> mountains I know
not what <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName> would say. So I shall say that I
executed you in the province of <placeName>Omi</placeName>. As this was fore-ordained
from a previous life, how is it possible anyhow to escape it?"
To this <persName>Rokudai</persName> made no reply, but calling <persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito</persName>
<pb n="301" xml:id="p315-301"/>

Roku he said: "Ah, dɔ not go back to <placeName>Miyako</placeName> and tell them
that I have been beheaded by the way. They will find it out
in the end, but if they hear it now their grief and lamentations
will be a hindrance to me in the after life. So tell them you
have accompanied me as far as <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>." And as they
listened to his words, the two of them were dissolved in tears.
By and by <persName>Saito Go</persName> overcame his feelings and replied:
"After
our lord has become a god or <persName>Buddha</persName> we shall never again in
this life return to <placeName>Miyako</placeName>." And repressing his tears he bowed
to the ground.
</p>
<p>
Then the young lord, seeing that his time was come, pulled
back with his beautiful little hand the long hair that hung about
his shoulders, whereat the soldiers of the guard exclaimed:
"See how he is yet master of himself;" and they all moistened
the sleeves of their armour. Then, looking toward the west, he
joined his hands together, and repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term> in a loud
voice ten times, stretched out his neck for the blow. Then
<persName>Kano-no-Kudo Saburo Chikatoshi</persName>, who had been chosen as the
executioner, seized his sword and moved round behind him
from the left, and was just about to strike, when his eyes
darkened and his senses reeled, so that he could not see where to aim
his weapon. "I cannot do it," he exclaimed, hardly knowing
what he did : 'pray choose someone else;" and he threw down
his sword and withdrew.
</p>
<p>
Then as they cast about to find someone to take his place,
there appeared a priest in black robes, riding a cream coloured
horse which he was whipping up furiously; and as the people
round about called out to him: "See the handsome young lord
whom <persName>Hojo Dono</persName> is just beheading in the pine-wood," and ran
thronging to see the sight, he waved his whip at them anxiously,
and in his excitement and suspense pulled off his hat and
beckoned to them with it.
</p>
<p>
Then, as <persName>Hojo</persName> stood waiting to see what was the reason,
the priest rode up, sprang down from his horse and exclaimed:
"The young lord is reprieved; here are instructions from
<pb n="302" xml:id="p316-302"/>

<persName>Yoritomo</persName>." <persName>Hojo</persName> took the document and read: "Concern-
ing <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>, the son of <persName>Komatsu-no-sammi Chujo Kore-
mori-no-Kyo</persName>, whom you have arrested: he is reprieved at the
request of <persName>Mongaku-bo</persName>, the priest of <placeName>Takao</placeName>; let there be no
mistake. To <persName>Hojo-no-Shiro Dono</persName>. <persName>Yoritomo</persName>." <persName>Hojo</persName> read it
through several times, ejaculating: "Marvellous! Marvellous!"
and then put it away.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName>, it is
unnecessary to say, and even <persName>Hojo's</persName> own retainers, shed tears of joy
and relief.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9" xml:id="v12_ch9">
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>HASE ROKUDAI.</head>
<p><persName>Mongaku's</persName> thus appearing and declaring: "The young
lord is reprieved," was indeed a brave sight. "When <persName>Yoritomo</persName>
at first declared that, as his father the <persName>Sammi Chujo Dono</persName> had
been in command in many battles, he could not pardon him,
whoever might ask it," said <persName>Mongaku</persName>, "I reproached him again
and again for his heartless ingratitude, and demanded to know
why I had lost his favour, but it was all in vain, and he went off
to hunt at <placeName>Nasuno</placeName>. But I followed him to his hunting-ground,
and at last prevailed on him to grant my request. That was
why I was so late." "When the twenty days that we agreed
upon had passed," replied <persName>Hojo</persName>, "I concluded that <persName>Kamakura
Dono</persName> was unwilling to spare him. How fortunate it is that I
brought him with me and met you here, and so was saved from
error." And he provided <persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName> with spare
saddled horses that he had, and sent them back to the Capital.
After he had gone some distance with them to see them on their
way, he took leave of them saying: Since I have many
weighty matters to report at <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, I will now say
farewell." And so he resumed his journey to the eastward.
He
was a very gentle warrior indeed.
</p>
<p>
So <persName>Mongaku Shonin</persName> of <placeName>Takao</placeName> took charge of the child
<persName>Rokudai</persName> and travelled day and night towards the Capital, so that
<pb n="303" xml:id="p317-303"/>

when he reached the vicinity of <placeName>Atsuta</placeName> in <placeName>Owari</placeName> the year had
already come to an end, and it was the evening of the fifth day
of the new year when they arrived in the Capital. Making their
way to a residence that <persName>Mongaku</persName> hạd in <placeName>Nijo Inokuma</placeName>, they
stopped there that the child might rest awhile, and it was midnight
when they reached the <placeName>Daigakuji</placeName>. They knocked at the gate, but
no one came, and there was no sound. Only the little white dog
that <persName>Rokudai</persName> had kept came running out through a hole in the
plastered wall, wagging its tail in its joy at seeing him again.
"Where is my mother?" he asked it pathetically, whereupon
<persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName> climbed over the wall and searched
everywhere, but it did not seem as though anyone had been there
recently. "It was only to see my mother again that I wished to
live," exclaimed the child, bursting into tears unmindful of
everyone, "but what is the use of my living now?"
</p>
<p>
The rest of the night they spent there, and at dawn they
enquired of one who lived near, who told them: "Last year
they went to the <placeName>Dai-Butsu</placeName>, but since the new year we hear they
are living at <placeName>Hase-dera</placeName>. So <persName>Saito Roku</persName> hastened at once to
<placeName>Hase</placeName> and told the lady what had happened, whereupon, without
a moment's delay she started for the Capital and came to <placeName>Dai-
gakuji</placeName>. "Ah, <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>," she exclaimed when she saw
him, "is this indeed real, or is it a dream? But do you quickly
renounce the world." But <persName>Mongaku</persName>, thinking it a pity, did
not make him a monk, but took him to <placeName>Takao</placeName> and built a little
cell where his mother could live with him also. In former days
also there are like examples of the great mercy and compassion
of <persName>Kwannon</persName> that succours both sinners and righteous alike. It
was indeed a wondrous blessing.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10" xml:id="v12_ch10">

<head>THE EXECUTION OF ROKUDAI.</head>
<p>So <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName> grew up thus until he was fourteen or
fifteen years old, when he was so beautiful that he shed as it
<pb n="304" xml:id="p318-304"/>

were a radiance all about him. But that his mother should
have said in admiration : "If we were in power he would now
be an officer of the <persName>Konoe</persName>," was too outspoken. At a
favourable opportunity <persName>Yoritomo</persName> sent to <persName>Mongaku</persName> saying: "What
kind of youth is <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>, son of the <persName>Sammi Chujo
Koremori</persName> whom you have in charge? Do you think of him as
you did of me formerly, that he is one able to subdue the
enemies of the Throne, or avenge his father's shame?" "Do
not trouble yourself about him," replied <persName>Mongaku</persName>, “for he is a
spiritless and stupid fellow." Still <persName>Kamakura Dono</persName> was not
quite satisfied. "If there were a rebellion that priest would be
for it," he remarked ominously; "and though it is not likely in
my lifetime, I don't know about my posterity." When this
reached his mother's ear she again urged him to become a
monk without further delay. So, about the spring of the
fifth year of Bun-ji, cutting off his beautiful hair short at the
neck, and attired in a robe and hakama of drab colour, with
his travelling-box on his back, he started out on a pilgrimage;
and <persName>Saito Go</persName> and <persName>Saito Roku</persName> accompanied their master in
similar garb. First ascending Mount <placeName>Koya</placeName>, he visited <persName>Takiguchi
Nyudo</persName>, the virtuous priest who had helped his father to attain
enlightenment and instructed him in the Way, and from him
heard all particulars of his father's becoming a monk, and his
subsequent death. Then, wishing to retrace his father's steps,
he went on to <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, and looking across at the island of
<placeName>Yamanari</placeName> which is in front of the shrine called <placeName>Hama-no-miya</placeName>, to
which his father had rowed, he greatly desired to cross over to
it, but on account of the contrary wind he was not able. As he
stood gazing over at it he wondered in what place it was that his
father had sunk, and felt as though he wished to ask the
white-crested waves that came rolling in on the shore. Regard-
ing the sand of the beach tenderly, as being perchance the bones
of his parent, his sleeves were bedraggled with tears, and ever
moist like those of the sea-damp garments of the fishermen.
</p>
<p>
Passing all that night on the beach, he spent his time reading the
<pb n="305" xml:id="p319-305"/>

<title>Sutras</title> and repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term>, drawing with his finger the
likeness of a <persName>Buddha</persName> in the sand; and when dawn appeared,
summoning a priest, he dedicated all the merit he had acquired
to the enlightenment of his father's spirit, and returned to the
Capital with his heart full of sadness.
</p>
<p>
Now the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> at this time was <persName>Go-Toba-no-in</persName>, and
he thought of nothing but pleasure, so that all the affairs of state
were in the hands of the mother of the <orgName>Empress</orgName>, and people
lamented greatly at it. Because the <persName>King of Go</persName> loved <persName>Ken-
kaku</persName>, those who suffered hurt in the kingdom were not few;
and because <persName>Sai-yu</persName> captivated the <persName>King of So</persName>, many ladies of
the Court died of starvation. And because those of lower rank
will always imitate the pleasures of those above them, all those
of understanding loudly lamented the danger to the Empire.
But the second <persName>Imperial Prince Go-Takakura-in</persName> was much
devoted to statesmanship, and very diligent in intellectual
matters, and <persName>Mongaku</persName>, shrewd priest that he was, was very
fond of meddling in the management of affairs, so that he was
extremely anxious to set this Prince on the Throne; but while
<persName>Yoritomo</persName> was alive, he did take any steps.
</p>
<p>
Then, on the thirteenth day of the first month of the tenth
year of Kenkyu, <persName>Yoritomo</persName> died at the age of fifty three,
and <persName>Mongaku</persName> raised a revolt forthwith; but it was immediately
discovered, and officers were sent to <placeName>Nijo Inokuma</placeName> to arrest
<persName>Mongaku</persName>, who was then more than eighty years of age, and
banish him to the province of <placeName>Oki</placeName>. As they were leading him
away from the Capital he burst out: "What does that Ball-
loving Youth mean by letting them take an old man like me,
who does not know whether he will live from one day to the
next, and send him under Imperial Chastisement to a place like
<placeName>Oki</placeName>, far away from the Capital. You had better see that
someone is sent there to bring me back pretty quickly!" And
so, dancing with rage and reviling strongly, <persName>Mongaku</persName> was sent
into exile. It was because this <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was so fond of playing
ball that <persName>Mongaku</persName> called him by this contemptuous name.
It
<pb n="306" xml:id="p320-306"/>

was very strange that afterwards, in the period Sho-kyu, on
account of his many rebellions, though there were many other
provinces, this <roleName>Emperor</roleName> should have also been banished to the
far-off isles of <placeName>Oki</placeName>. And it is said that the angry ghost of
<persName>Mongaku</persName> wrought many evil things there; continually
appearing in the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> Presence, and saying all kinds of things to
him.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Rokudai Gozen</persName>, who was now styled <persName>Sammi-no-Zenji</persName>, had continued to live in retirement in the recesses of
<placeName>Takao</placeName>. "The son of such a man, and the disciple of such a
man," quoth <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, "though he may have shaved his head,
is not likely to have shaved his heart." And he sent a petition
to the Court that he might be taken and executed, and
<persName>An-Hōgwan Sukekane</persName> arrested him and sent him down to the
<placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, where <persName>Okabe-no-Gon-no-kami Yasutsuna</persName> of
the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName> was ordered to take him and behead
him at <placeName>Tagoe-gawa</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Sagami</placeName>. That his life
was spared from his thirteenth year to beyond his thirtieth was
solely through the mercy of <persName>Kwannon</persName> of <placeName>Hase</placeName>. And with the
death of <persName>Sammi-no-Zenji</persName> there perished the last of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>.

<head>THE FORMER EMPRESS BECOMES A NUN.</head>
<p>The <persName>Former Empress Kenrei-mon-in</persName> went to <placeName>Yoshida</placeName> at
the foot of <placeName>Higashi-yama</placeName>, and entered the cell of a monk of <placeName>Nara</placeName>
called <persName>Chūnagon-no-Hoin Keiei</persName>. It was old and dilapidated,
with the garden overgrown with weeds, and shinobu-grass
clustering thickly on the roof. The curtains were gone and the
bedchamber exposed, and there was nothing to keep out the
wind and rain. Though there were many kinds of flowers,
there was none to care for them, and though the moon streamed
in every night, no one was there to gaze at it. She, who had
formerly spent her time in the Jewel Halls and within the
Brocade Curtain, now suffered the unspeakable hardships of
dwelling in this mouldering cell, bereft of all her old
companions, like a fish on the dry land or a bird torn from its nest,
and she yearned fondly for the times she had spent tossing on
the heaving billows. As the poet says: "She longs for the
far-off waves of the ocean, and the clouds of the limitless
<placeName>Western Sea</placeName>; the moss grows thick on the reed-thatched hut;
tears fall as the moon shines in the garden on <placeName>Higashi-yama</placeName>."
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">As the poet says. <persName>Tachibana Chokkan</persName>, in the <title>Ro-ei-shu</title>.</note>
<p>
So on the first day of the fifth month of the first year of
Bun-ji, the <persName>Former Empress</persName> cut short her hair and was
instructed in the Way by <persName>Ashobo-no-Shonin Insei</persName> of <placeName>Chorakuji</placeName>,
and for the customary offering she presented him with the robe
of the <persName>Emperor Antoku</persName>, which he had worn up to the time of
his death, so that the perfume yet clung to it. She had brought
it with her to the Capital from the far-off <placeName>Western Provinces</placeName>,
<pb n="308" xml:id="p322-308"/>

intending to keep it as a memorial of him and never let it leave
her person, but now, as she had nothing else to offer, and
thinking moreover that it would be an aid to his Enlightenment,
weeping bitterly she handed it to him. The <persName>Shonin</persName> was so
affected that he could utter no word, but pressing the sleeve
of his black robe to his face, he retired weeping from the
Imperial Presence. And this robe was afterwards woven into a
banner and suspended in front of the <persName>Buddha</persName> of the <placeName>Chorakuji</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
This <roleName>Empress</roleName> was appointed Imperial Consort at the age of
fifteen, and at sixteen was raised to the rank of <orgName>Empress</orgName>. She
was ever by the <orgName>Emperor's</orgName> side, helping him in the government
by day, and the only sharer of his love by night. At the age
of twenty two she bore a Prince who was named as the Heir to
the Throne, and when he assumed the Imperial Dignity she
became <persName>Retired Empress</persName> and took the name of <persName>Kenrei-mon-in</persName>.
She was the daughter of the <persName>Lay-priest Chancellor Kiyomori</persName>,
and as she had thus become the mother of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> she was
held in great reverence by all the people. She was twenty nine
years old this year, and the beauty of her fair face was not yet
dimmed, neither was the elegance of her slender form impaired;
but what now availed the loveliness of her hair? So she
renounced this world and became a nun, but even when she had
entered the True Way her grief was not assuaged. Ever she
seemed to see before her the figures of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> and the <persName>Nii
Dono</persName> and the others as they sank in the waves, and never in this
life could she forget those melancholy scenes, so she wondered
why she had remained alive to bear such sorrows, and her tears
were never dried.
</p>
<p>
Even in the short nights of the fifth month, it was not easy
to keep awake, but if she did not fall asleep she did not
dream of those who had passed away. Faintly the shadow of
her single light fell on the wall outside, and all night the dismal
drumming of the rain sounded on the lattice of the windows.
Surely the Imperial Consorts who were shut up in the <placeName>Joyo
Palace</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName> were not more wretched. And how did it
<pb n="309" xml:id="p323-309"/>

remind her of the beloved past, this orange tree in blossom by
the eaves, that the former tenant had brought and planted there.
As its heavy perfume was wafted into her chamber, and the note
of the cuckoo was borne once and again to her ears, this ancient
verse came into her mind, and she wrote it on the lid of her
inkstone:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Hark! the cuckoo seeks the fragrant scent of the orange,</l>
<l>Where are those that I loved? Whither departed? he cries."</l>
</lg>
<p>
The rest of the <roleName>Court Ladies</roleName>, who had thrown themselves
into the sea, but had not drowned themselves with the same
determination as the <persName>Nii Dono</persName> and the wife of <persName>Echizen-no-sammi
Michimori</persName>, had been roughly dragged out by the <orgName>Genji</orgName> soldiers
and brought back to the Capital, as has been before related.
And these, both young and old, all became nuns and were living
in concealment in far-away valleys and dells in the mountains,
wretched and emaciated in appearance and quite unrecognisable
as their former selves. The places where they lived have gone
up in smoke, and the empty site is all that remains. They have
all turned into overgrown moorland, and no former intimate
ever comes nigh them. All is as unfamiliar as his home to one
who is bewitched by fairies and returns to it after seven
generations.

<head>THE FORMER EMPRESS GOES TO OHARA.</head>
<p>Now as her former poor abode was ruined in the great
earthquake of the ninth day of the seventh month, and its outer
wall fell down, the <persName>Former Empress</persName> had nowhere to live.
How had the days altered from when the green-clad <persName>Palace
Guards</persName> stood continually before her gate, for now the
tumbledown wall, more bedewed with moisture than the outside
moorland, seemed as if it understood the change of times, and
resented the incessant shrilling of the insects. So though the
<pb n="310" xml:id="p324-310"/>

nights grew longer and longer, the <roleName>Empress</roleName> could not sleep, but
brooded continually over her melancholy condition, and this,
added to the natural sadness of autumn, became almost too
much for her to bear. In this changed world there was none to
feel sympathy for her, and all those of her affinity were gone, so
that none were left to cherish her in her need.
</p>
<p>
Only the wife of <persName>Reizei-no-Dainagon Takafusa-no-Kyō</persName> and
the wife of <persName>Shichijo-no-Shuri-no-Taiyu Nobutaka-no-Kyō</persName> used to
send and assist her secretly. 'Ah," she exclaimed, "in former
days who would have ever dreamed that I should have come to
accept anything from such as these?" And as she wept afresh
at the thought, the ladies who accompanied her could not refrain
from moistening their sleeves. Since her present dwelling was
too near the Capital, and attracted the eyes of curious
passersby, she thought she would like to go to some place far away in
the depths of the mountains to spend her days remote from all
sound of unrest, but for some time she was unable to hear of
any. Then a certain lady came to <placeName>Yoshida</placeName> and said to her:
"There is a place northward from here, in the mountains of
<placeName>Ohara</placeName>, called <placeName>Jakko-in</placeName>, and it is very quiet." "A mountain
abode is very lonely, it is true," she answered, "but it is good
to live in, for it is remote from the troubles of this world." So,
as she desired it, the matter was settled, and the wives of
<persName>Nobutaka</persName> and <persName>Takafusa</persName> sent a palanquin to fetch her.
</p>
<p>
Thus at the end of the ninth month she proceeded to the
temple of <placeName>Jakko-in</placeName>. As they went along she gazed at the
beauty of the autumn tints, while the sun sank gradually
behind the mountains. The dreary boom of the evening bell of
the wayside temple, and the thick-lying dew on the grass
as they passed drew tears from her eyes, while the fierce gale
whirled the leaves from the trees in all directions. Suddenly
the sky grew dark and the autumn drizzle began to fall; the
cry of a deer sounded faintly and the shrilling of the insects was
incessant. Nothing was wanting to add to the sum of her
afflictions, which seemed indeed such as few had been made to
<pb n="311" xml:id="p325-311"/>

suffer.
Even when she was driven about from shore to shore
and from island to island her melancholy was not to be
compared to this. The place she had chosen to dwell in was ancient
and surrounded by mossy rocks; the reeds in the garden were
now covered with hoar-frost instead of dew, and when she gazed
on the faded hue of the withered chrysanthemums by the wall,
she could hardly fail to be reminded of her own condition.
</p>
<p>
Entering before the <persName>Buddha</persName> she prayed: "For the Sacred
Spirit of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, that it may attain perfect Buddhahood,
and for the departed spirits of all the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, that they may
quickly enter the Way of Salvation." But still the image of the
late <roleName>Emperor</roleName> was impressed on her mind, and wherever she
might be, and in what world soever, she thought she could never
forget it. So they built for her a small cell ten feet square
beside the <placeName>Jakko-in</placeName>, and in it were two rooms, in one of which
she put her shrine of <persName>Buddha</persName>, and in the other she slept; and
there she spent her time continually repeating the <term>Nembutsu</term> and
performing the Buddhist services, both by night and by day.
And it happened that once, on the fifth day of the tenth month,
that she heard the sound as of someone treading on the oak
leaves which had fallen and covered the garden.
"Who can it
be," she exclaimed, that comes to disturb one who has thus
renounced the world? Do you go and see; for I will conceal
myself if it be anyone I do not wish to meet.” So one of the
ladies went to look, and it was only a young stag that had passed
that way.
"Who is it? Who is it?" asked the <orgName>Empress</orgName>,
whereupon the lady <persName>Dainagon-no-suke-no-Tsubone</persName> composed
these lines in reply:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Who is the stranger whose steps are heard so nigh to our dwelling?</l>
<l>'Tis but a stag whose tread rustles the leaves of the vale."</l>
</lg>
<p>
And the <roleName>Empress</roleName> was so much affected by this verse that she
wrote it on the shoji of the window.
</p>
<p>
And as she thus passed her tedious hours, even in this
dreary spot she found many subjects for comparison. The trees
<pb n="312" xml:id="p326-312"/>

that grew by the eaves of her cell she likened to the Seven
Precious Trees of <placeName>Paradise</placeName>, and the water that collected in the
hollows of the rocks she compared to the Lake of the Eight
Virtues in the <placeName>Pure Land</placeName>. Impermanence is as the flowers of
spring that so quickly fall when the wind blows, and Worldly
Illusion like the moon of autumn so easily lost behind the
clouds. She thought how she had diverted herself with the
flowers in the <placeName>Shoyoden</placeName>, and how on the day after they had
been scattered by the wind, and how in the <placeName>Choshuden</placeName> they had
made poems to the moon, and its light had been hidden by the
clouds. Formerly she had lived delicately in the Jewel Halls,
and couches of brocade had been spread for her in the Golden
Palace, but now she dwelt in a hut of brushwood and thatch,
and the sleeves of her robe were dishevelled and tear-stained.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3" xml:id="kancho_ch3">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>THE HO-O PROCEEDS TO OHARA.</head>
<p>Thus in the spring of the second year of Bun-ji the <persName>Hō-o</persName>
expressed a wish to go to <placeName>Ohara</placeName> and see the place where <persName>Kenrei-mon-in</persName> was living in retirement, but the second and third
months were stormy and the cold still lingered, neither did the
snow melt on the mountains nor the icicles thaw in the valleys.
Thus the spring passed and the summer came, and the festival of
<placeName>Kamo</placeName> was already over when His Majesty proceeded to the
recesses of <placeName>Ohara</placeName>. Though the visit was incognito, the <persName>Sadaisho
Tokudaiji</persName>, the <persName>Dainagon Kwazan-in</persName> and the <persName>Gon-Chunagon
Tsuchi-mikado</persName> accompanied His Majesty, with six of the higher
<persName>Courtiers</persName> and eight of lower rank, beside several of the <persName>Imperial
Guards</persName>. As they went by way of <placeName>Kurama</placeName>, His Majesty was
able to visit the temple of <placeName>Fudarakuji</placeName>, built at <placeName>Fukayabu</placeName> at
<placeName>Kiyohara</placeName>, and the place where the Consort of the <persName>Emperor
Go-Reizei-in</persName> had formerly lived in retirement at <placeName>Ono</placeName>, after
which the Imperial Palanquin proceeded on its way. The white
clouds on the distant mountains reminded them of the cherry-blossoms
<pb n="313" xml:id="p327-313"/>

 that had fallen, while the green leaves on the twigs
seemed to regret the passing of spring. It was past the twentieth
day of the fourth month, so the summer grasses had grown up
thickly, and as they parted them on the little-trodden road, His
Majesty, who had never been there before, was much affected
by the lonely uninhabited look of the place.
</p>
<p>
At the foot of the western mountains they came to a small
temple. This was the <placeName>Jakko-in</placeName>. It might be well described by
the lines:
</p>
<quote>
<l>"Its roof-tiles* were broken and mist was its only incense; the doors had fallen from their hinges and the beams of the moon were its sanctuary lamps.")</l>
</quote>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">*Its roof-tiles, etc. An unknown quotation.</note>
<p>
But the pond and trees of
its ancient garden were dignified; the young grass had grown
thick, and the slender shoots of the willow were all hanging in
confusion, while the floating water-plants on the pond might be
mistaken for spread out brocade. On the island the purple hue
of the flowering wistaria mingled with the green of the pine-tree,
while the late-blooming cherry among the green leaves was
more rare than the early blossoms. From the eight-fold clouds
of the yamabuki that was flowering in profusion on the bank
came the call of the cuckoo, a note of welcome in honour of His
Majesty's visit.
</p>
<p>
When the <persName>Ho-o</persName> saw it he composed these lines:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"When on the pond's clear waters the cherry-tree scatters its blossoms,</l>
<l>Thick on the limpia wave ripple the clusters of flowers."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Pleasant was the sound of the water as it fell from the clefts of
the time-worn rocks, and the ivied walls and beetling crags
would have defied the brush of the painter. When his Majesty
came to the cell of the former <orgName>Empress</orgName>, ivy was growing on the
eaves and the morning-glory was climbing up them; the
hare'sfoot fern and the day lily mingled together, and here and there
was a useless gourd-plant; here was the grass that grew thick in
the path of <persName>Gan-en</persName>, and the white goose foot that keeps men at a
<pb n="314" xml:id="p328-314"/>

distance, and here too was the rain that moistened the door of
<persName>Gen-ken</persName>. The cedar boards of the roof were gaping, so that the
rain, the hoar-frost, and the dew of evening vied with the moon
beams in gaining entrance, and the place appeared well-nigh
uninhabitable. Behind was the mountain and in front was
the moor,
and the bamboo grasses rustled loudly in the wind. As is the way
with those who have no friends in the world, she seldom heard any
news from <placeName>Miyako</placeName>, but what she did hear was the cry of the
monkeys as they sprang from tree to tree, and the sound of the
wood-cutter's axe, for few people there were that came there.
</p>
<p>
Then the <persName>Ho-o</persName> called to the inmate, but there was no
answer, but after a while a withered-looking old nun appeared of
whom he enquired: "Whither has the former <orgName>Empress</orgName>
deigned to go?" "Over there to the mountain to pick some
flowers," was the reply. "How hard it is," said His Majesty,
"that since she has thus renounced the world, she has no one to
perform such services for her."
"Since this fate has come upon
her in accordance with the <term>Five
Precepts</term> and the <term>Ten Virtues</term>,"
replied the nun, "why should she spare herself the austerities
of mortifying her flesh? In the <title>Ingwa Kyo</title> it is written :
"If you wish to know the cause in the former life, look
at the effect in the present life; and if you wish to know the
effect in the future life, look at the cause in the present one.".
And if she knows the cause and effect of both past and future
lives, there is nothing at all for her to lament. In former days
<persName>Prince Siddartha</persName> at the age of nineteen went forth from <placeName>Gaya</placeName>
and dwelt at the foot of <placeName>Mount Dantaloka</placeName>; covering himself.
with the leaves of trees, going up the peaks to get firewood and
down into the valleys to draw water, by the merit of his
austerities and mortifications at last he attained to perfect
<persName>Buddha</persName>-hood." Looking at this nun the <persName>Ho-o</persName> noticed that she
was clothed in pieces of silk and cotton put together roughly
anyhow, and thinking it strange that one of such an appearance
should speak thus, he asked her who she was. For some time
she could answer nothing, but only wept, but after a while she
<pb n="315" xml:id="p329-315"/>

controlled her feelings and replied: "I am ashamed to say so,
but I am <persName>Awa-no-Naiii</persName>, daughter of the late <persName>Shonagon Nyudo
Shinzei</persName>, and my mother was <persName>Kii-no-Nii</persName>. As your Majesty was
formerly so kind to me, the reason why you do not now
recognise me must be that I have become old and infirm."
And she pressed her sleeve to her face, unable to control herself
any longer a sad sight indeed. "Can it be so ?" exclaimed
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>; "and you are truly <persName>Awa-no-Naiji</persName>? I did not
recognise you, but however one may think, it all seems like a
dream." And his voice became choked with sobs, while the
<persName>Courtiers</persName> who accompanied him were moved also, some saying
that what she said was very strange, while others thought it
quite natural. And the <persName>Ho-o</persName> looked about him hither and
thither, and the plants of the garden, heavy with dew, fell
against the boundary wall, and the surface of the rice-fields was
covered with water so that there seemed not even room for a
snipe to perch; and His Majesty went to the cell of the former
<roleName>Empress</roleName> and opened the shoji and looked in. In one chamber
were the images of the Three Bosatsu, <persName>Amida</persName>, <persName>Kwannon</persName> and
<persName>Seishi</persName>, and in the hand of <persName>Amida</persName>, who stood in the middle, was
a cord of five colours. On the left was a picture of <persName>Fugen</persName>, and
on the right of <persName>Zendo Kwasho</persName>, beside which hung a portrait of
the <persName>Late Emperor</persName>. There were also eight rolls of the <title>Hokke
Kyō</title> and nine volumes of the <title>Amida Kyō</title>. Instead of the
perfume of orchid and musk, the smoke of incense filled the air.

<p>
The merit of <persName>Jomyo Koji</persName>, who in a nine foot square cell ranged
in order thirty two thousand floors and invited all the <persName>Buddhas</persName>
of the Ten Quarters, could hardly have been greater. On the
shoji were stuck texts from all the <title>Sutras</title>, written on coloured
paper, and among them was one written at <placeName>Shoryosen</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName>
by <persName>Oe-no-Sadamoto</persName>, which ran thus: "Sounds of celestial
melody are heard afar off, and from the regions of the setting
sun <persName>Amida</persName> comes to save mankind." A little removed from
<pb n="316" xml:id="p330-316"/>

these was a verse that seemed to be: rom the former <persName>Empress's</persName>
own pen:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Who would have dreamed that from here I should view the moon of the Palace?</l>
<l>Far from the haunts of men, lone in the depths of the hills."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Then on the other side he saw what appeared to be her
bed-chamber. On a bamboo pole hung her robes of hempen
cloth, besides some bed-quilts of paper, and when he thought of
the countless beautiful robes of silk gauze and rich brocade,
wrought of the stuffs both of <placeName>China</placeName> and of her own land, that
she had worn in the dream-like days of her dominion, the tears.
coursed down His Imperial cheeks, and the <persName>Courtiers</persName> of his
escort also could not help moistening their sleeves at these
evidences of her altered condition.
</p>
<p>
Presently two nuns clad in dark robes were seen making
their way slowly and painfully down through the rough
rocks of the mountain side, and on the <persName>Ho-o</persName> enquiring who
they were, the old nun replied: "The one carrying a basket
of mountain-azalias on her arm is the former <orgName>Empress</orgName>, and the
one who has the load of bracken for firewood is <persName>Dainagon-no-
suke-no-Tsubone</persName>, the daughter of <persName>Torikai-no-Chūnagon Kore-
zane</persName>, and adopted daughter of <persName>Gojo-no-Dainagon Kunitsuna</persName>,
who was nurse to the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName>." As she spoke, she burst
into tears, and the <persName>Ho-o</persName> and his <persName>Courtiers</persName> also applied their
sleeves to their eyes.
</p>
<p>
The former <orgName>Empress</orgName>, since she was living apart from the
world in this way, was so overwhelmed with shame at seeing
them that she would gladly have hidden herself somewhere
to avoid them, but she could not. Every evening she girt up
her long sleeves to draw the water for the offering, and early
every morning they were wet and bedraggled with the mountain
dew. So, as she could not again retrace her steps to the
mountain, neither was she able to get into her cell, the old nun
came to her as she stood dumbfounded and took her basket
from her hands.

<p>"Since you have renounced the world," said <persName>Awa-no-Naiji</persName>,
what does it inatter about your appearance? I pray you
come and greet His Majesty, for he will soon return." So the
former <roleName>Empress</roleName> repressed her emotion and entered her cell,
"Before my window in prayer I await the coming of <persName>Amida</persName>;
and at my lowly door I look for the Saviour of mankind; but
Your Majesty's gracious visit I did not expect," she said, and
the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, looking upon her, thus replied: "Even those who
live for eighty thousand kalpas in the highest heaven of the
<placeName>World of Formlessness</placeName> must surely die, and the denizens of the
<placeName>Six Celestial Worlds of Desire</placeName> cannot escape the <term>Five Changes</term>.
The wondrous bliss of the city of delight of the heavens of
<persName>Indra</persName>, and the passionless serenity of the high pavilions of the
mid-Dyana world of the heavens of <persName>Brahma</persName>, even these, like the
rewards of dreamland or the pleasures of a vision, eternally
change and dissolve, turning and revolving like the wheels of a
chariot. And since the Celestial Beings are subject to the <term>Five
Changes</term>, how shall men escape? But I hope that you still hear
tidings from your old acquaintances, for you must think much
of old times." "There are none from whom I hear anything
now," replied the <orgName>Empress</orgName>, "except from the wives of <persName>Nobu-
taka</persName> and of <persName>Takafusa</persName>, who continually send me help; but in
former days I never even dreamed of being assisted by people
such as these." And as she spoke her tears flowed, and her lady
companions also hid their faces in their sleeves.
</p>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom"><term>Six Paths</term>. Hell, Pretas, Beasts, Asuras, Men and Heaven.</note>
<p>
After a while she controlled her emotion and continued:
Though I need not say that being reduced to such a condition
has been a great grief to me, yet I feel gladness on account of
my enlightenment in the next world. By the help of <persName>S'akya
Muni</persName>, reverently relying on the Great Vow of <persName>Amida</persName>, I may

escape the troubles of the <term>Five Hindrances</term> and the <term>Three Obe-
diences</term>, and in this latter age purify the <term>Six Senses</term>, so that,
fixing my hopes on the highest heaven, and fervently praying
for the enlightenment of our whole family, I may await the
coming of the Saving Host. But the thing that I can never forget
is the image of the late <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, and even though I try to bear
his loss with patience, I cannot, for truly there is nothing that
wrings the heart like parental affection, And so I pass both day
and night in ceaseless prayer for his enlightenment, and this will
be my guide also in the True Way." "Verily this our Empire
is but a petty country," answered the <persName>Ho-o</persName>," but since by
observance of the Ten Virtues he became its <roleName>Emperor</roleName>,
everything must be in accordance with his will. And though all who
are born in an age when the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName> has been widely
spread, if they have the desire to practise the Law, without
doubt will be hereafter reborn in bliss, yet when I regard your
present condition, though it is in accordance with the vanity of
human affairs, I cannot but be overcome with grief." And as
he spoke His Majesty burst into tears. "Born the daughter of
the <persName>Taira Chancellor</persName>," continued the former <orgName>Empress</orgName>, "and
having become the mother of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, the whole Empire
lay in the hollow of my hand. Clad in my varied robes of state,
from the New Year Festival to the Year End Ceremonies I was
surrounded by the <persName>Great Ministers of State</persName> and the <persName>Courtiers</persName> in
brilliant throng, even as above the clouds the <placeName>Six Heavens of
Desire</placeName> and the <placeName>Four Dhyana Heavens</placeName> are encircled by eight
myriads of lesser heavens. Dwelling in the <placeName>Seiryoden</placeName> and the
<placeName>Shishinden</placeName> behind the Jewel Curtain, I gladdened my eyes in
spring with the blossoms of the Imperial Cherry Tree. In the
hot months of summer I refreshed myself with crystal streams,
and in the autumn I viewed the moon in the midst of my ladies.
In the cold nights of winter soft bedquilts were heaped up to
warm me, and I thought that I had only to wish for the draught
of immortality, and the magic potion of eternal life and youth
brought from <placeName>Horai</placeName> the <placeName>Elysian isle</placeName>, for it to be immediately

forthcoming. So full was my life of joy and happiness, both by
day and by night, that perchance even in heaven nothing could
'surpass it.
</p>
<p>
Then in the autumn of Ju-ei, when <persName>Yoshinaka</persName> came up to
attack us, after setting fire to their ancient homes, our family fled
from the Capital where they had lived so long, looking sadly
back at the Imperial Palace. Going down to the shore of <placeName>Suma</placeName>
and <placeName>Akashi</placeName>, of which I before knew only the name, we set sail
on the boundless ocean, and so from island to island and from
shore to shore, our sleeves wet with the salt spray by day, and
the cry of the sea-birds mingling with our sobs by night, we
rowed about seeking some favourable refuge, but never
forgetting our ancient home. Left thus with none to help us, the
anguish of the <term>Five Changes</term> of our dissolution came upon us.
We speak of the 'Pain of the Grief of Parting' and the 'Pain of
the Regret of Meeting,' and both of these in one I have known
to the full. For when we came to <placeName>Dazaifu</placeName> in the island of <placeName>Kyu-
shu</placeName>, thinking that there we might find safety for a while, <persName>Kore-
yoshi</persName> drove us out again, so that we could find no rest for our
foot throughout all the length and breadth of the land. And so
the next autumn arrived, and we who had always been wont to
view the moon from the sacred enclosure of the <placeName>Nine-fold Palace</placeName>,
now spent our nights watching it on the eight-fold sea-road.
And in the tenth month, seeing that the <orgName>Genji</orgName> had driven us from
the Capital, and we had been expelled from <placeName>Kyushu</placeName> by <persName>Kore-
yoshi</persName>, so that we were like a fish in a net having no place
whither to escape, the <persName>Chujo Kiyomune</persName>, hating to live any
longer, threw himself into the sea in despair. And this was but
the beginning of our afflictions. Tossing on the waves by day,
and spending our sleepless nights in the ships, we had no tribute
of rice with which to prepare the Imperial Food, and sometimes,
when we wished to prepare it, we had no water with which to
do so.
Afloat on the vast ocean we could not drink its salt
water, and thus we underwent all the suffering of the <placeName>Preta
world</placeName>. Then, after we had won two fights at <placeName>Muroyama</placeName> and
<pb n="320" xml:id="p334-320"/>

<placeName>Mizushima</placeName>, the spirits of our family were revived, and building a
fortress at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, all the <persName>Courtiers</persName>
and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> doffed their court robes and clad themselves in
armour for the fight, and the din of battle was incessant both
by day and night, even like unto the battle of the <persName>Asuras</persName> with
<persName>Indra</persName> and his <persName>Devas</persName>. Then in our flight after the defeat at <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, parents were left behind by their children and wives
separated from their husbands, and if we saw`a fishing boat in
the offing we trembled lest it should be a ship of the enemy,
while a flock of white herons in the pine-trees threw us into panic
lest it should be the white flag of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>. And at last, when
in the fight at <placeName>Moji</placeName>, <placeName>Akama</placeName> and <placeName>Dan-no-ura</placeName> she saw that our
doom was sealed, the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName> weeping exclaimed :
"Now
-
it seems our last hour has come, and in this fight there is little
hope of any of the men surviving. Even if any of our distant
relations are left alive they will scarcely be able to perform the
services for our departed spirits, but from of old time it has been
the custom to spare the women, so you must live to pray for
the spirit of the <roleName>Emperor</roleName>, and I beg you also to say a prayer
for my future salvation." And as in a dream we listened to her
words, of a sudden a great wind blew, and the drifting mist came
down upon us, so that the hearts of the warriors were
confounded, and in the face of heaven they could do nothing. Then, as
the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName> took the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> into her arms and went to the
gunwale of the vessel, with a look of anxiety on his face he
enquired of her : 'Where is it that you are going to take me,
<persName>Ama-ze</persName>?" Turning to her youthful Sovereign with tears
streaming down her cheeks, she answered: "Perchance Our
Lord does not know it, but though through the merit of the Ten
Virtues practised in former lives you have been reborn to the
Imperial Throne in this world, yet, by the power of some evil
karma, destiny now claims you. So now turn to the east, and
bid farewell to the deity of the <placeName>Great Shrine of Ise</placeName>, and then to
the west, and say the <term>Nembutsu</term>, that <persName>Amida Buddha</persName> and the
Holy Ones may come to welcome you to the <placeName>Pure Western</placeName>
<pb n="321" xml:id="p335-321"/>

<placeName>Land</placeName>. This land is called small as a grain of millet, but yet is
it now but a vale of misery. There is a <placeName>Pure Land of happiness</placeName>
beneath the waves, another Capital where no sorrow is Thither
it is that I am taking Our Lord. "And thus comforting him, and
binding his long hair up in his dove-coloured robe, blinded with
tears the child-Sɔvereign put his beautiful little hands together,
and turned first to the east to say farewell to the deity of <placeName>Ise</placeName> and
to <persName>Sho-Hachimangu</persName>, and then to the west and repeated the
<term>Nembutsu</term>, after which the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName>, holding him tightly
in her arms, leaped with her Sovereign into the sea. My eyes
darkened and my heart stood still, and it is a thing I can never
forget or bear to think of. And at that moment from all those
who still lived there went up so great and terrible a cry, that the
shrieks of all the damned burning amid the hottest hell of <placeName>Avichi</placeName>
could not exceed it. And so, after being roughly dragged out
of the sea by the soldiers, as I was being sent back again to the
Capital, I came to the shore of <placeName>Akashi</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Harima</placeName>.
And as I chanced to fall asleep there for a space, I saw in a
dream as it were our former Palace, but of greater and more
surpassing beauty, and there sat our <persName>Former Emperor</persName> with all
the <persName>Courtiers</persName> and <roleName>Nobles</roleName> of our house ranged about him in all
their ceremonial grace and dignity; such a sight as I had not
seen since we left our ancient Capital. And when I asked where
this place might be, the <persName>Nii-no-Ama</persName> answered and said:
"This
is called <placeName>Ryugu</placeName>, the <placeName>Palace of the Dragon King</placeName> of the sea.
"Ah, how blessed!" I replied, "and is it then a land where
is no more sorrow?" "In the <title>Ryu-chiku Kyo</title> you may
read," she said, "and never neglect to pray fervently for
our future happiness." And as she said this I awoke, and since
that time I have done nothing but read the <title>Sutras</title> and say the
prayers for their future bliss. And all this, I think, is
nothing else but the <term>Six Paths</term>." "In <placeName>China</placeName>," said the <persName>Ho-o</persName>,

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>THE PASSING AWAY OF THE FORMER EMPRESS.</head>
<p>But the boom of the bell of <placeName>Jakko-in</placeName> proclaimed the closing
day as the evening sun began to sink in the west, and His
Majesty, full of regret at saying farewell, set out on his return
journey with tears in his eyes. The former <orgName>Empress</orgName>, her mind
occupied in spite of herself with thoughts of her bygone days,
and shedding on the sleeve of her robe the tears she could not
restrain, stood watching the Imperial Procession until she could
see it no more, and then, again entering her cell, she prostrated
herself before the <persName>Buddha</persName> to pray that the Sacred Spirit of the
former <roleName>Emperor</roleName> might attain complete Buddhahood, and that
the departed spirits of all the <orgName>Heike</orgName> might quickly enter the
Way of Salvation. In former days she turned to the east and
prostrated herself before the deity of the <placeName>Great Shrine of Ise</placeName> and
<persName>Sho-Hachimangu</persName> to pray; "That the Precious Life of the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> may be prolonged a thousand and ten thousand
ages; " but now she sadly turned to the west and prayed:
"That the Departed Spirit may be reborn in one of the Buddha
Lands."
</p>
<p>
To express the regret and affection she still felt for her past
life, the <roleName>Empress</roleName> wrote these verses on the shoji of her cell:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"When shall I learn once more, what I now for so long have forgotten,</l>
<l>How things go in the Court, scenes that I long to review?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Now that the things of the past have vanished away into dreamland,</l>
<l>So from this brushwood cell, soon may 1 too disappear."</l>
</lg>
<note type="gloss" place="bottom">900. <persName>Zo-o Gongen</persName>. Kongo Zo-o, a deity of Mt. Yoshino in Yamato.</note>
<p><pb n="323" xml:id="p337-323"/>

Moreover <persName>Tokudaiji-no-Sadaisho Sanesada Ko</persName>, one of the
<persName>Courtiers</persName> who accompanied the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, also wrote these lines on
one of the posts of the cell:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Once our Sovereign's face shone forth as clear as the moon-beams,</l>
<l>But in the mountain vale, hid is the light of the moon."</l>
</lg>
<p>
And while the former <roleName>Empress</roleName> was weeping and meditating
on the past and the future with pain mixed with pleasure, the
cry of the mountain cuckoo sounded twice or thrice as the bird
flew by, and suggested to her these lines:
</p>
<lg>
<l>Cuckoo, why do you come to measure your plaint with my anguish?</l>
<l>So in this fleeting world, what am I too but a voice?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
Thus of the twenty survivors of the <orgName>Heike</orgName> who were taken
alive, some were paraded through the streets and beheaded, and
some were exiled to distant provinces, far from their wives and
children: with the exception of <persName>Ike-no-Dainagon</persName> there was not
one left living in the Capital.
Of the forty and more ladies' who
were left nothing is known. They were taken in by their
kinsfolk and looked after by their relations. With their hearts
full of concealed regrets they spent their days in lamentation.
Those in high places, up to the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> within the Jewel
Curtain, were filled with disquiet, while the common people,
down to the dweller in the hut of brushwood, could find no rest.
Husband and wife were parted and far remote from the Palace,
while parent and child knew not each other's abode. And all
this was because of the many evil deeds of the <persName>Lay-priest
Chancellor Kiyomori</persName> which he continually committed, in
condemning people to death and banishing them, and dismissing
them from office and appropriating their emoluments, without
either regard for the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> on his Throne, or pity for the
people beneath him. So certain is it that the good or evil deeds
of the fathers will descend upon the heads of the children.
</p>
<p>
But the former <roleName>Empress</roleName> continued to live on vainly for
some years, till at length she fell ill and took to her bed. She
<pb n="324" xml:id="p338-324"/>

had been awaiting it for a long time, and so now she took in her
hand the cord of five colours that was fastened to the hand of the
<persName>Buddha</persName>, and repeated the <term>Nembutsu</term>; "<persName>Namu Amida Nyorai</persName>,
Lord who guidest us to the <placeName>Paradise of the West</placeName>, in
remembrance of thy Great Vow, I beseech thee receive me into the
<placeName>Pure Land</placeName>." And as she thus prayed, <persName>Dainagon-no-suke-no-Tsubone</persName> and <persName>Awa-no-Naiji</persName>, standing on each side of her couch,
lifted up their voices in lamentation at their sad parting. And
as the voice of her prayer grew weaker and weaker, a
purple cloud of splendour grew visible in the west, and an
unknown scent of wondrous incense filled the cell, while celestial
strains of music were heard from above, and thus, about the
middle of the second month of the second year of Ken-kyu, the
former <persName>Empress Kenrei-mon-in</persName> breathed her last.
</p>
<p>
The two ladies, who had never left her side since the day
that she had been chosen as Imperial Consort, were plunged
into the depths of despair at this parting from their mistress, and
as their relations and connections had all disappeared, and there
was none to help them, they had nothing left but the
performance of the Buddhist services. And at last they too, like the
<persName>Dragon girl</persName> who attained enlightenment, and like the <persName>lady
Idaike</persName>, also departed this life to be reborn in bliss.

<note type="gloss" place="bottom">This first paragraph, which is written in Chinese prose, is not found in many

<p>
Now in <placeName>Nippon</placeName> there are many famous swords. There are
the Sacred Swords <persName>Totsuka-no-Tsurugi</persName>, the Ten-handbreadth
Sword, <persName>Hige-kiri</persName>, the Beard-cutter, <persName>Hiza-maru</persName>, the Knee-cutter,
and <persName>Kogarasu</persName>, the Little Crow. And concerning the origin of
<persName>Hige-kiri</persName> and <persName>Hiza-maru</persName>, it is thus related. <persName>Seiwa Tenno</persName>, the
fifty sixth Earthly Sovereign, had many sons, and of these
Princes the sixth, named <persName>Sadazumi Shinno</persName>, had a son <persName>Tsunemoto
Roku-Son-O</persName>, whose eldest son <persName>Tada-no-Mitsunaga Kazusa-no-
kami</persName> was the first to take the name of <persName>Genji</persName>. Being appointed
by Imperial Edict to protect the Empire, <persName>Mitsunaga</persName> exclaimed ;
"How can I protect the Empire unless I have a good sword ?”
So he procured iron and had smiths summoned, but when they
had forged the swords, there were none that he found to his
<pb n="326" xml:id="p340-326"/>

liking. While he was wondering what to do, someone told him
that there was a smith who had come from abroad, who had
been working for many years at <placeName>Tsuchiyama</placeName> in the district of
<placeName>Mikusa</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Chikuzen</placeName>. So he ordered that he
should be summoned, and they brought him to the Capital, but
though he also forged many swords, not one of them found
favour in the eyes of <persName>Mitsunaga</persName>, so there was nothing for him to
do but to return with his purpose unfulfilled. "Alas," said he,
"if I go back thus, after having made this long journey from
far-off <placeName>Tsukushi</placeName> to no effect, what will be left of my fame as
a craftsman ? From ancient days those who have desired
anything of the Gods and <persName>Buddhas</persName> have had recourse to prayer
to obtain it." And he betook himself to the shrine of <persName>Hachiman</persName>
and prayed: "<persName>Kimyo-chorai Hachiman Dai-Bosatsu</persName>! Grant
that I may make a sword such as I wish, and I will become a
vessel at thy disposal." This vow he wrote and offered in the
deepest sincerity, and when seven days had passed, a divine
answer came to him in the night, saying: "I have had
compassion on you in respect to your desire. Go now
forthwith, and forge the iron for sixty days, after which you will
make two swords of the finest quality." Greatly rejoiced at this
significant dream, the craftsman went forth from the shrine, and
carefully selecting and fusing the iron, he worked at it and
forged it for sixty days, so that at length he produced two
swords of the finest quality, two feet seven inches long,
comparable even to the three foot blade of <persName>Ko-so</persName> of <placeName>Kan</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Mitsunaka</persName> was greatly pleased with them, and had them
tried on two criminals, whereat one cut through to the beard, so
he named it <persName>Hige-kiri</persName>, or Beard-cutter, while the other cut
through the knees also, and this he named <persName>Hiza-maru</persName> or
Knee-divider. So with these two blades he ruled the Empire,
and the very trees and herbs inclined before him. And so in
due time he was succeeded by his eldest son <persName>Yorimitsu</persName>, in
whose time many extraordinary things happened. And one of
these strange things was the disappearance of many people.
<pb n="327" xml:id="p341-327"/>

They did not die, but while in a room surrounded by many
others, without being seen to get up or depart, they would
suddenly vanish as if blotted out. And as none knew whither
they had gone, or could hear where they were, fear seized on
all, and from the Sovereign to the common people everyone
was in indescribable confusion and panic. On enquiring more
closely into the matter, it transpired that in the days of the
<persName>Emperor Saga Tenno</persName>, the daughter of a certain <persName>Courtier</persName> of high
rank was so overcome by jealousy that she went to the shrine
of <placeName>Kibune</placeName>, and secluded herself there for seven days, praying
thus: "<persName>Kimyo-chorai, Kibune Daimyojin</persName>! In answer to my
seven days prayer and seclusion, grant that living I may be
changed into a demon, that so I may be able to kill the woman
of whom I am jealous." Then the <persName>Myojin</persName> had compassion on
her and answered: "I am indeed sorry for your condition. If
in truth you wish to become a demon, you must change your
appearance and go and bathe yourself in the <placeName>Ujikawa</placeName> from the
third to the seventh day." Then the lady returned rejoicing to
the Capital, and secluding herself in an unfrequented spot,
divided her long hair into five tresses, and made it into five
horns. She put vermilion on her face, and reddened her body,
on her head she placed a tripod, to the legs of which she
fastestened torches, holding also in her mouth another torch
flaming at both ends. In this guise she rushed out through the
<placeName>Yamato</placeName> highway to the south after dark when people had
retired, and when they saw her thus with face and body red and
eyebrows painted thick and black with dye, while five jets of
flame flared out from her head, they never doubted that she was
a demon, and fell down in the streets beside themselves with
fear, some even dying in the excess of their terror. Then she
went to the <placeName>Ujikawa</placeName> and bathed herself in its waters between
the third and seventh day, whereupon, according to the promise
of the <persName>Kibune Myojin</persName>, she was transformed living into a demon.
And she it is that is known as <persName>Uji-no-Hashi-hime</persName>, or the <persName>Lady of
the Bridge of Uji</persName>. And thus she was able to seize and slay not
<pb n="328" xml:id="p342-328"/>

only the woman of whom she was jealous and the man who had
spurned her, but all their relations and connexions, high and
low, male and female. And when she wished to seize a man
she would change into a woman, and if she would take a
woman she would become a man, so that all the people of the
Capital of all ranks shut the doors of their houses after the Hour
of the Monkey, (4. p.m.) and would neither go forth nor allow
anyone to come in.
</p>
<p>
Now at this time <persName>Settsu-no-kami Yorimitsu</persName> had four famous
retainers who were as his four Deva Kings, and they were
<persName>Tsuna</persName>, <persName>Kintoki</persName>, <persName>Sadamichi</persName> and <persName>Suetake</persName>; and of these the
mightiest was <persName>Tsuna</persName>. As he was born at <placeName>Yoshida</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Musashi</placeName> he was also called <persName>Yoshida Genji</persName>. Now it
chanced that <persName>Yorimitsu</persName> had some small matter to be done at
<placeName>Omiya</placeName> in <placeName>Ichijo</placeName>, and he sent <persName>Tsuna</persName> as his messenger. As it
was after dark he gave him the sword <persName>Higekiri</persName> and bade him
take one of his horses. And so he went and made enquiry at
the place, and was on his way back again with the reply, when,
as he was crossing the bridge once more at <placeName>Ichijo Horikawa</placeName>, he
saw at the eastern end a girl who seemed to be about twenty,
with a skin as white as snow and a most graceful figure, dressed
in a robe of a plum-red colour with an amulet-bag hung round
her neck, and a volume of the <title>Sutras</title> carried in her sleeve.
She was quite alone and unaccompanied, and was going along
to the south as <persName>Tsuna</persName> passed the western end of the bridge and
rode clattering across. "Whither are you going," she called
confidingly to him, "I am going to <placeName>Gojo</placeName>, but as it is getting so
dark, I feel frightened, so will you not see me on my way?"
"Take my horse, then, "replied <persName>Tsuna</persName>, immediately springing
to the ground; and as she seemed pleased at the offer, he took
her up in his arms and set her in the saddle. Thus they went
along the eastern end of <placeName>Horikawa</placeName> to the south until they came
within a couple of tan of <placeName>Ogimachi</placeName>, when the maiden turned
back, saying; "I really have no particular business at <placeName>Gojo</placeName>:
I live outside the city; so will you not be kind enough to
<pb n="329" xml:id="p343-329"/>

accompany me thus far ?” "Indeed I will escort you wherever
you wish," replied <persName>Tsuna</persName>; when suddenly she changed her
beautiful form into the shape of a hideous demon, and crying
out: "The place I am going to is <placeName>Otagi-yama</placeName>;" she seized
him by the queue and flew off with him through the air toward
the north-west. <persName>Tsuna</persName>, without the least trepidation, at once
drew <persName>Hige-kiri</persName> and slashed upward with it, cutting clean through
the arm of the demon; and thus released fell headlong until he
alighted on the roof of the gallery of the shrine of <placeName>Kitano</placeName>, while
the demon, with its arm cut off, flew away towards <placeName>Otagi</placeName>. Then
<persName>Tsuna</persName> jumped down from the gallery and pulled off the demon's
hand that was still gripping his queue, and lo! it was changed
from its snow-white hue and was now of an exceeding blackness,
covered everywhere thickly with white hairs that looked like
silver wire. When he brought it and showed it to <persName>Yorimitsu</persName>,
he was exceedingly astonished, and thinking it a very strange.
happening, he summoned the diviner <persName>Harima-no-kami Abe-no-Seimei</persName>, and asked him what was to be done. "Let <persName>Tsuna</persName>
strictly seclude himself in his house for seven days," he advised,
" and let him keep the hand of the demon carefully shut up and
guarded, while he occupies himself with reading the <title>Nio Sutra</title>."
</p>
<p>
<persName>Tsuna</persName> did so, and when six days had already passed, at dusk
someone came knocking at the door of his house, and when he
enquired who was there, the voice of his foster-mother replied
that it was she who had come from her home at <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> to
see him. Now this foster-mother was the aunt of <persName>Tsuna</persName>.
Knowing that it was not right to talk at such a time, he went to
the gate and said: "I am glad to see you after such a long
time, but I am now undergoing a religious seclusion for seven
days, and today is but the sixth day, so until tomorrow is over
I cannot see anyone soever. I pray you stay somewhere until
the day after tomorrow, and then I will gladly see you." At
this she burst into tears;
"What am
I to do?" she
exclaimed ;
Is it for this that I took you in as soon as you
were born, and brought you up? My rest was often broken at
<pb n="330" xml:id="p344-330"/>

night, and I chose the damp places to sleep on myself that you
might rest in the dry; and so, until you were four or five years
old no bitter wind was suffered to blow upon you, and day and
G            night I prayed that I might live to see you grow up to be
preeminent among men. And now my prayers are answered,
and in the house of our lord <persName>Settsu-no-kami Dono</persName> there is none
to equal you. And as your fame is in the mouths of all, both
high and low, I have rejoiced greatly, but until now I have
never been able to traverse the long country road to see you.
But there is no pain like that caused by parental affection, and
of late I have many times had bad dreams about you, so fearing
that some evil might have befallen you, I have come all the way
from <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> to see you, and now you will not allow me even
to enter your gate. How could I have loved such an ungrateful
son ? "Then <persName>Tsuna</persName>, unable to withstand her arguments any
longer, opened the gate and brought her in. At this she was
very glad and for some time they talked about her journey and
about what she meant to do henceforth, after which she asked
him what was the reason of his seven days' seclusion, and as he
could hardly conceal it, he told her everything as it had
happened. When she had heard it all she declared that he had been
quite right to take every precaution, and regretted that she had
been angry owing to not having known it, "But" she
continued," parents are like protecting deities to their children, as
the proverb goes, so I will think no more of it. But what kind
of a thing is a demon's hand? I should much like to see it."
"I would willingly show it to you," replied <persName>Tsuna</persName>, "but I
must keep it shut up until the seventh day is over, so after
tomorrow is past I will let you see it." "Oh, very well; it
it doesn't matter at all; I don't want to see it," she answered
shortly, "for I intend to start home again before dawn."
Seeing her displeasure, however, <persName>Tsuna</persName> opened the box and
brought it out and showed it to her. "Ah, how horrible! "
she exclaimed, looking at it again and again, "and so that is
what a demon's hand is like." And suddenly standing up, she
<pb n="331" xml:id="p345-331"/>

became transformed into a horrible demon, and, crying out:
"That is my hand; I will take it;" she kicked out the gable
of the roof and flew up into the sky, flashing fire as she went.
And that is the reason that the <persName>Watanabe</persName> clan always build
their roofs without any gable, and make them like a
gardenhouse. Now though <persName>Tsuna</persName> thus lost the demon's hand, and
his seclusion was made of none effect, yet by the power of the
<title>Nio Sutra</title> he was preserved from harm. And after cutting off
the demon's hand, the name of the sword was changed from
<persName>Hige-kiri</persName> to <persName>Oni-maru</persName> (Demon-queller).
</p>
<p>
During the summer of that year <persName>Yorimitsu</persName> fell sick of an
ague, from which he could get no relief by any means; and
after some time it recurred every day with burning heat and
pains in the head, and thus he lay, sorely tormented, as it were
between heaven and earth; and so he cont nued for the space
of
thirty days. Now it happened one night that he was a little
better and the fever had abated somewhat, so that the four
faithful retainers, who had been nursing him, had retired to the
guard-room to sleep a while. As it grew somewhat late, <persName>Yori-
mitsu</persName> saw, from the shadow of the dim light in his chamber, the
form of a tall priest, some seven feet high, coming stealthily up
towards him, holding a rope to throw over him. <persName>Yorimitsu</persName>
sprang up in surprise, crying out: "Who are you, you rascal,
who dares to take a rope to <persName>Yorimitsu</persName> ?" And as he did so
he caught up the sword <persName>Hiza-maru</persName>, that stood by the side of
his pillow, and made a cut at him. Aroused by the noise, the
<persName>Four Deva Kings</persName> came running in with all speed to enquire
what it was, whereupon <persName>Yorimitsu</persName> told them what had taken
place, and when they looked beneath the lampstand there was
blood spilt there. Searching further with lights in their hands,
they saw that there was a trail of blood from the doors of the
chamber out on to the verandah, and when they followed this
up, they found that it led to a mound at the back of the shrine
of <placeName>Kitano</placeName>, and there stopped. So they dug into the mound,
and there was a great spider, four feet across, which they seized
<pb n="332" xml:id="p346-332"/>

and brought back with them. "Ugh!" exclaimed <persName>Yorimitsu</persName>
when he saw it, "how strange to have been tormented by a
horrible thing like this for thirty days! You had better expose
it on the highroad." So they stuck it on an iron spit and took
it to the river-bed and there left it: and from this time <persName>Hiza-
maru</persName> was known as <persName>Kumo-kiri</persName> (Spider-cutter), and after the
days of <persName>Yorimitsu</persName> it passed into the hands of <persName>Dewa-no-kami
Yorimoto</persName>.
</p>
<p>
In the fifth year of the period Tenki, <persName>Iyo-no-kami Yori-
yoshi</persName>, the eldest son of <persName>Kawachi-no-kami Yorinobu</persName>, the
younger brother of <persName>Yorimitsu</persName>, was appointed <persName>Mutsu-no-kami</persName>
and ordered to undertake the subjection of the brothers <persName>Kuriya-
gawa-no-Jiro Abe-no-Sadato</persName>, and <persName>Tori-no-Umi-no-Saburo Mune-
to</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, who had made insurrection, and on this occasion
<persName>Yorimoto</persName> was bidden by the Emperor to hand over to him
<persName>Oni-maru</persName> and <persName>Kumo-kiri</persName>, the two treasure swords of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>.
"But these blades have been handed down as ancestral
heirlooms for three generations from my grandfather <persName>Tada-no-Mitsunaka</persName>," replied <persName>Yorimoto</persName>," and ought to be passed on to
my son, so I feel very loath to part with them." But as his
remonstrance was not listened to, at last he had to give up the
swords to <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName>. Then <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName> set out for <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, and
after fighting for nine years he has victorious, taking the head
of <persName>Sadato</persName> and bringing <persName>Muneto</persName> back as a prisoner to the
Capital. <persName>Sadato</persName> was nine feet five inches in height and <persName>Muneto</persName>
six feet four, so, when he was brought to the house of <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName>,
all the <roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName> went there to divert themselves
with the sight of the strange Eastern Barbarian, and one of them
in jest broke off a twig of plum blossom, and asked <persName>Muneto</persName>
what it was. Immediately he replied in these lines:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"This is what in our land is called the flower of the plum tree;</l>
<l>What do you call it at Court? Seemingly you do not know."</l>
</lg>
<p>
Whereupon they went away again crestfallen. <persName>Muneto</persName>
<pb n="333" xml:id="p347-333"/>

was eventually banished to <placeName>Kyushu</placeName>, where there are many of
his descendants still living at the present day. They are the
<persName>Matsuura</persName> clan. The two swords passed from <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName> to his
son <persName>Hachimantaro Yoshiie</persName>, and he, hearing that <persName>Takehira</persName> and
<persName>Munehira</persName> in the province of <placeName>Dewa</placeName> had fortified themselves at
<placeName>Yamakita</placeName> and <placeName>Kanazawa</placeName> and rebelled, hastened thither to put
them down, but though he was a daring and courageous
warrior, it was three years before he was able to conquer them.
So, adding the nine years campaign of <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName> to this, these
swords did battle for twelve years, and always, by reason of the
virtue that was in them, the enemy was defeated.
</p>
<p>
<persName>Yoshiie</persName> had many children, but his eldest son <persName>Tsushima-no-
kami Yoshichika</persName> was sent to <placeName>Izumo</placeName> to quell a rebellion there,
and was slain by <persName>Inaba-no-kami Masamori</persName>, and neither his second
son <persName>Kawachi-no-Hangwan Yoshitada</persName> nor his third <persName>Shikibu-no-Taiyu Yoshikuni</persName> received the two swords, but they were given
to the fourth son <persName>Rokujo-no-Hangwan Tameyoshi</persName>. When he
was fourteen years old his uncle <persName>Mino-no-kami Yoshitsuna</persName>
revolted, and he was sent to attack him. When <persName>Yoshitsuna</persName>
heard that his own nephew <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> was marching against
him, he cut off his queue and surrendered. This also was
through the virtue of the swords. Again, when he was eighteen
years old, some rebel priests of <placeName>Nara</placeName> made a confederacy against
the Throne and marched on the Capital, many myriads strong,
whereupon <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> with only sixteen horsemen rode out
against them to <placeName>Kurikoyama</placeName>, and by the might of the two.
blades, drove them back again. On this occasion a certain
<persName>Yamahoshi</persName> composed this comic verse:
</p>
<lg>
<l>"Down came the <placeName>Nara</placeName> monks as far as <placeName>Kurikoyama</placeName>.;</l>
<l>There a few soldiers appeared: rapidly captured the lot."</l>
</lg>
<p>
This satire irritated the monks of <placeName>Nara</placeName>, and while they were
considering what answer they could make to it, they heard that
some monks of <placeName>Hieizan</placeName> had been tricked by a certain <persName>Awa-no-Josa</persName> and put into prison, so they commemorated it in these
lines:
<pb n="334" xml:id="p348-334"/>

</p>
<lg>
<l>"Why thus easily duped by the wiles of <persName>Awa-no-Josa</persName>;</l>
<l>Foolish monks of <placeName>Hiei</placeName>, how do you find it in jail?"</l>
</lg>
<p>
So, as a reward for thus having made his uncle prisoner at
the age of fourteen, <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> was appointed to be Sakon-no-Shokan, and for his loyalty in having repelled the <placeName>Nara</placeName> monks
at the age of eighteen he was made Hyoye-no-Jo: at thirty eight
he became Saemon, and at thirty nine Kebiishi. Afterwards he
set his heart on becoming Governor of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, but this province
was a place of ill-omen for him, since his grandfather <persName>Yoriyoshi</persName>
had been fighting there for nine years, and his father <persName>Yoshiie</persName> for
three; so that it was thought that the people would still feel
enmity against the family, and if <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> were appointed
to govern it disorder might ensue, so they asked him to take
another province instead. But he replied that if he could not
have his ancestral province he did not want any at all, and so
the matter ended by his receiving none.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> had forty six children by various mothers,
and he had a consort also at <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, who had a daughter
called the <persName>maid of Tatsutahara</persName>. And it happened once that the
<persName>Ho-o Go-Shirakawa</persName> made a pilgrimage to <placeName>Kumano</placeName> and enquired
if there was a Betto there; and when they told him that there
was not, he said that this was not as it should be, and bade them
elect one.
</p>
<p>
Now there were two clans at <placeName>Kumamo</placeName> called <persName>Ui</persName> and
<persName>Susuki</persName>, whose ancestors had come over to this country as
the right and left wings of the <persName>Gongen</persName> when he flew over from
<placeName>Magadha</placeName> in <placeName>India</placeName>, and they had taken possession of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>
and behaved themselves as they pleased without regard to
anyone. And the <persName>Susuki</persName> planned to make a certain <term>Yamabushi</term>,
who came there to pray and offer flowers before the shrine, the
Betto. He protested that he was not fit for the office, but they
constrained him, and this was the origin of <persName>Kyoshin Betto</persName>.
Then they said that a Betto must be hereditary, so that he must
not live as a priest, but take a wife. Looking about to find one
for him, they thought that <persName>Tameyoshi's</persName> daughter, the <persName>Maid of</persName>
<pb n="335" xml:id="p349-335"/>

<persName>Tatsutahara</persName>, would do very well, so they married her to him.
When <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> heard of it he was displeased, at it, saying:
"The man who becomes my son-in-low ought to be a warrior of
distinction among the <orgName>Taira</orgName> or <persName>Minamoto</persName> clans. Those who
hold the office of Betto or Shugyo of temples and shrines may
be good men or not; I hear they are chosen from the crowd
on account of their religious merit, but I think it very strange
conduct that she should allow herself to be mated with such a
fellow who has no future before him, and send me no word of?
it: she is a most unfilial daughter." Then the two swords that
had been handed down to <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> made noises all night
long; and the noise made by <persName>Oni-maru</persName> was like the roaring of a
lion, while that made by <persName>Kumo-giri</persName> was like the hissing of a
snake. So they changed the name of <persName>Oni-maru</persName> to <persName>Shishi-no-ko</persName>
(Lion-cub), and that of <persName>Kumo-giri</persName> to <persName>Hoe-maru</persName> (Roarer). At
this time it was noised abroad that the <orgName>Genji</orgName> and <persName>Heike</persName> had
taken up hostile positions, and there would be a battle, so within
the Capital there was great confusion. As the news soon
penetrated to the remotest mountain and province, it was not
long before <persName>Kyoshin Betto</persName> heard it. "I may be unfilial," said
he, "but at a time like this I will cast in my lot with him. and
perhaps he will pardon my neglect." So he gathered all the
priests of all ranks who were living at his shrine, and who
could bear arms, and rode up to the Capital with some ten
thousand horsemen. When people saw them they exclaimed:
"What kind of a man is this? In the provinces of <placeName>Kii</placeName>' and
<placeName>Izumi</placeName> we do not remember to have heard of a great leader like
this." But when they enquired more closely, they heard that it
was <persName>Tameyoshi's</persName> son-in-law, <persName>Kyoshin</persName>, the <persName>Betto of Kumano</persName>.
When his father-in-law heard that he had come to join him, he
declared that he was a very worthy fellow, though he knew
nothing about his name or lineage. And when he afterwards
ascertained that he was the youngest grandson of <persName>Sanekata
Chujo</persName>, and by birth by no means beneath himself, he was sorry
he had not troubled to meet him till now. So he forgave him
<pb n="336" xml:id="p350-336"/>

and received him, and in recognition of his good-will towards
himself, presented him the ancestral sword <persName>Hoe-maru</persName> as a
wedding gift. But <persName>Kyoshin Betto</persName>, declaring that such an one
as he was not worthy to possess the hereditary blade of the
<persName>Genji</persName>, offered it to the shrine of the <persName>Gongen</persName>. And <persName>Tameyoshi</persName>,
thus bereft of one of his swords, felt as though he had lost a
hand, so he summoned his favourite sword-smith from the
province of <placeName>Harima</placeName>, and bade him forge a blade that should be
the exact counterpart of <persName>Shishi-no-ko</persName>. The smith made one of
the finest temper, and <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> was exceedingly pleased with
it, and as he fitted it with 'menuki' made in the shape of crows,
he named it <persName>Ko-garasu</persName>, or 'Little Crow.' So he treasured
these two blades, <persName>Shishi-no-ko</persName> and <persName>Ko-garasu</persName>, as being of equal
worth, but <persName>Ko-garasu</persName> was two bu longer than the other. And
it happened one day that he drew both of them and placed
them up against the shoji of the room where he was, when,
without anyone touching them, they fell down with a great
clatter, and when he took them and looked to see why they had
fallen, and if they were damaged, he perceived that <persName>Ko-garasu</persName>,
which had erstwhile appeared to be longer by two bu, was now.
the same length as <persName>Shishi-no-ko</persName>. "Strange!" he thought,
"how can this be?" But when he examined the point to see
whether it was broken or cut off, there was no sign of either
thing. Still wondering, he looked at the hilt, but the <term>menuki</term>
were not disturbed, so he removed the blade from the hilt and
behold! two bu of the tang inside it had been newly cut away,
while, when he pushed out the <term>menuki</term>, they seemed to be
lower down. Concluding, therefore, that <persName>Shishi-no-ko</persName> had cut
the piece off, he changed its name to <persName>Tomo-kiri</persName>, or Comrade-
cutter. Thereafter, being advanced in years and infirm, and
considering that the swords could be of no further use to him,
he handed them on to his heir <persName>Shimozuke-no-kami Yoshitomo</persName>.
</p>
<p>
Then, when the war of the Hogen period began, <persName>Yoshitomo</persName>
was summoned to the Emperor's Palace, while <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> went
to that of the Retired Emperor with his six other sons. On
<pb n="337" xml:id="p351-337"/>

the eleventh day of the seventh month of the year of Hogen the
battle began at the hour of the Tiger, (4. a.m.) and at the hour
of the Dragon, (8. a.m.) it ended; for in three hours the army
of the <persName>Retired Emperor</persName> was shattered and defeated. Then
<persName>Tameyoshi</persName> fled to <placeName>Hieizan</placeName>, and becoming a recluse changed his
name to <persName>Gi-ho-bo</persName>, while his son <persName>Yoshitomo</persName>, anxious to save his
father's life, sought earnestly to obtain his pardon; but since he
was an enemy of the Throne it was of no avail, and after a while,
to his infinite sorrow he received the news that he had been put
to death. <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> himself, as a reward for his services on
this occasion, was promoted to be Sama-no-kami, but of his six
brothers who had been summoned by their father, five were
slain, and one only, <persName>Tametomo</persName>, escaped. He, after some time
had elapsed, was brought from <placeName>Tane</placeName> in <placeName>Kyushu</placeName> and banished to
the province of <placeName>Izu</placeName>, but in the end he too was executed, and his
four sons with him.
</p>
<p>
Thus <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> alone survived, but in the first year of
Heiji he was persuaded by <persName>Aku-Uemon-no-kami Nobuyori</persName> to
raise a rebellion. He had many sons, but of them all he singled
out the third, <persName>Uhyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName>, to succeed him as the
head of the house in the next generation, and at the age of
thirteen he clad him in a suit of armour called <persName>Suzushi</persName>, and
girt on him the sword <persName>Tomo-kiri</persName>, giving him the preeminence
over all the others. But he was defeated in the battle that
ensued, and being an enemy of the Throne he fled from the
Capital and took refuge at <placeName>Hira</placeName> in the west of the province of
<placeName>Omi</placeName>, and there all night he murmured against the god <persName>Hachi-
man Dai-bosatsu</persName>; "In former days with this blade I smote my
enemies and laid them low as grass in the wind, but now the
virtue has gone from it, and the <persName>Dai-bosatsu</persName> has surely forsaken
me, else should I not have been thus impotent in the battle.
My grandfather <persName>Yoshiie</persName> became as the son of the <persName>Dai-bosatsu</persName>,
and was called after him <persName>Hachimantaro</persName>, receiving a promise that
he would not abandon his family for seven generations; whereas
I <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> am but the third." Then the god answered him in
<pb n="338" xml:id="p352-338"/>

a dream and said: "I have not forsaken you, and the sword
<persName>Tomo-kiri</persName> which was suddenly given to <persName>Mitsunaka</persName> would not
have lost its efficacy if it had still kept its early name <persName>Hige-kiri</persName>
or <persName>Hiza-maru</persName>; but as its name has been changed several times it
has gradually grown weaker, and when at last it received the
name of <persName>Tomo-kiri</persName>, it ceased to smite the enemy and turned
against its own possessor. That <persName>Tameyoshi</persName> was slain in Hogen,
and that all his children perished with him, was solely on
account of this name, and since it is also because of it that you
have been defeated now, it is not against me that you must
make complaint, but if you restore the sword its ancient name
your family will again be prosperous." When the deity had
thus made it all clear to him, <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> awoke, and perceiving
how unwise he had been to give the sword so ill-omened a
name, he again changed it to its ancient style of <persName>Hige-kiri</persName>. So
they left <placeName>Hira</placeName> and passed through <placeName>Takashima</placeName>, and <persName>Yoritomo</persName>
became drowsy in the saddle as they rode on, and lagged behind
his father some way.
</p>
<p>
Then some of the men of those parts, to
the number of about seventy or eighty, rode up and set on
him to take him alive, but <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, at once awakened, drew
forth <persName>Hige-kiri</persName> and laid about him with it, whereby some were
wounded and very many killed a sign that the blade was itself
again. That night they abode at <placeName>Shiotsu</placeName>, but at midnight,
having obtained a guide, they departed to the east of the
province of <placeName>Omi</placeName>. Hearing that the barrier at <placeName>Fuwa-no-seki</placeName> had
been closed, and that a force had set out from the Capital to
seize them, <persName>Yoshitomo</persName> turned aside and plunged into the
snowcovered mountains, but <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, who was yet but a child,
could not make his way through the thick snow, so he stayed
behind at the entrance of the defile. <persName>Akugenda Yoshihiro</persName>, the eldest
son, fled away by himself to the province of <placeName>Hida</placeName>, and <persName>Yoshitomo</persName>
with the second son <persName>Tomonaga</persName> escaped to <placeName>Mino</placeName> and stayed in
the house of a harlot at <placeName>Aohaka</placeName>, after which he with one
retainer went round by the coast and sought refuge with <persName>Osada
Shoji Tadamune</persName>, who lived at <placeName>Utsumi</placeName> in <placeName>Noma</placeName> in the province
<pb n="339" xml:id="p353-339"/>

of <placeName>Owari</placeName>, and who fell on them and slew both lord and
retainer in the early morning of the first day of the first month
of the second year of Heiji. This <persName>Tadamune</persName> was a vassal of
<persName>Yoshitomo</persName>, and was also the father-in-law of the retainer
<persName>Masakiyo</persName>, and that a man should slay both his hereditary lord
and his son-in-law is an act that appears the more base the more
it is considered. <persName>Tadamune</persName> then sent the heads of the two,
together with the sword <persName>Kogarasu</persName>, to the Capital for the
inspection of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was left behind at the entrance to
the mountain-pass, but was rescued by one <persName>Kusano Shoji</persName> from
eastern <placeName>Omi</placeName>. He was quite small enough to be concealed in
the ceiling, but being very shrewd he carefully considered and
came to the conclusion that he was sure to be discovered
in the end, and though he thought little of his own life, he felt
very dejected at the prospect of the treasured sword of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
being taken by the <orgName>Heike</orgName>. Wondering how he could conceal
it, he said to <persName>Shoji</persName>; "Your caring for me thus must be the
result of some connexion in a former life, and I now look on
you entirely as a parent. Now the chief priest of the shrine of
<placeName>Atsuta</placeName> in <placeName>Owari</placeName> is my maternal uncle; I pray you go thither
and take this sword and say to him; <persName>Yoritomo</persName> is in strict hiding
at such a place, but will surely be discovered at last; but though
he be taken and put to death this blade must not be given up,
so do you deposit it in the shrine." So <persName>Shoji</persName> went down to
<placeName>Atsuta</placeName> and brought the message of <persName>Yoritomo</persName> to the chief
priest, and he bestowed the sword in the treasure-house of the
shrine.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Kiyomori's</persName> younger brother <persName>Mikawa-no-kami Yori-
mori</persName> had been made Governor of <placeName>Owari</placeName> as a reward for his
merit in the fighting of Heiji, and he appointed <persName>Yayobyoye
Munekiyo</persName> his Mokudai or Deputy, and he, when he was going
up to the Capital, having heard where <persName>Yoritomo</persName> was concealed,
arrested him and took him with him. Being kept for a while in
the house of <persName>Munekiyo</persName>, he would have certainly been put to
death but for the entreaties of <persName>Ike-no-Gozen</persName>, the wife of <persName>Yori-</persName>
<pb n="340" xml:id="p354-340"/>

mori, but was only banished to <placeName>Hiru-ga-kojima</placeName> at <placeName>Hojo</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Izu</placeName>. Twenty one years later, in the summer of the
fourth year of Ji-sho when he had reached the age of thirty
four, having raised a revolt at the bidding of <persName>Takakura-no-miya</persName>
and also according to the Imperial Edict of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, he sent to
the shrine of <placeName>Atsuta</placeName> for the sword <persName>Hige-kiri</persName> and once more
girded it on, and so it was that he was able to subdue the whole
Empire to his will.
</p>
<p>
Now at the time of the wars of Heiji <persName>Tokiwa</persName> had a child
who was then called by his youthful name of <persName>Ushiwaka</persName>, and
who afterwards at the age of nine entered the temple of <placeName>Kurama</placeName>,
and was instructed by the priest <persName>Kakuen-bo Ajari Enjo</persName> the
disciple of <persName>Toko-bo Ajari Ennin</persName>, and thereafter changed his
name to <persName>Shanao</persName>. In the spring of the fourth year of the period
Sho-an, at the age of sixteen, he set out for the East Country in
the company of a gold merchant of <placeName>Gojo</placeName> named <persName>Kitsuji Sueharu</persName>,
and on the way underwent the ceremony of <term>Gempuku</term>, taking
the name of <persName>Kuro Minamoto Yoshitsune</persName>. Then he was received
by <persName>Gontaro Hidehira</persName> of <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, and while sojourning there he
heard that <persName>Yoritomo</persName> had begun his rebellion, and in great joy
rode away to join him. At a place called <placeName>Kanazawa</placeName> he met his
brother, and amid mutual rejoicing they related to each other
all that had befallen them up to that time. Then <persName>Kiso-no-kwanja
Yoshinaka</persName> of <placeName>Shinano</placeName>, also in obedience to the order of <persName>Taka-
kura-no-miya</persName>, rose in rebellion, and beginning with <placeName>Shinano</placeName> and
<placeName>Kozuke</placeName>, subdued all the seven provinces of the <placeName>Hokurikudo</placeName>,
after which he advanced on the Capital, and after driving out the
<persName>Heike</persName>, for a while did as he pleased with the whole Empire.
But not satisfied with this he must needs attack the <placeName>Hojuji-den</placeName>,
the Palace of the <persName>Ho-o</persName>, and without paying any heed to the
<roleName>Nobles</roleName> and <persName>Courtiers</persName> burn and destroy it, even going so far as
to shut up the <persName>Ho-o</persName> in the <placeName>Gojo Palace</placeName>, and dismiss from office
and imprison his <persName>Courtiers</persName>. Therefore was a messenger sent
from the Court to <placeName>Kamakura</placeName> to complain of all these outrages,
and <persName>Yoritomo</persName> in great indignation sent an army of sixty
<pb n="341" xml:id="p355-341"/>

thousand horsemen under the command of his two brothers
<persName>Kaba-no-Kwanja Noriyori</persName> and <persName>Kuro-no-Kwanja Yoshitsune</persName>.
On the twentieth day of the first month of the first year of
Gen-ryaku they entered the Capital, when <persName>Kiso Sama-no-kami</persName>
was def ated and driven out, and his head was taken at <placeName>Awazu</placeName>
in <placeName>Otsu</placeName>. Then, when they were about to press on to <placeName>Ichi-no-
tani</placeName> in <placeName>Settsu</placeName> to destroy the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, <persName>Tanso</persName> the <persName>Betto of Kumano</persName>
came to the Capital. Now concerning him, it had come to pass
that the five sons that the <persName>Betto Kyoshin</persName> had were appointed
each to one of the shrines of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>, to <placeName>Hongu</placeName>, <placeName>Shingu</placeName>,
<placeName>Nachi</placeName>, <placeName>Wakada</placeName> and <placeName>Tanabe</placeName>, and the one who was the most
distinguished was to succed him as Betto according to his
command which he left behind; and since <persName>Tanso</persName> of <placeName>Tanabe</placeName> was the
greatest of them all he was chosen to become Betto after his
father. And <persName>Tanso</persName> spoke saying; "The <persName>Genji</persName> are my maternal
relations, and I am rejoiced to see them gain the supremacy,
moreover with <persName>Yoritomo</persName> I am on terms of friendship, and I
hear that he has sent down his brother as his representative to
smite <persName>Kiso</persName> and to overthrow the <orgName>Heike</orgName>; therefore will I bring
forth the ancestral sword of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, that was first called
<persName>Hiza-maru</persName> and then <persName>Kumo-kiri</persName>, and which is now known as
<persName>Hoe-maru</persName>, which <persName>Kyoshin</persName> received from <persName>Minamoto Tameyoshi</persName>
and laid up before the <persName>Gongen</persName>, and restore it to the <orgName>Genji</orgName> that
they may with it subdue the <orgName>Heike</orgName>." So he received the sword
from the <persName>Gongen</persName> and went up to the Capital and presented it to
<persName>Kuro Yoshitsune</persName>, who rejoiced beyond measure and gave it the
name of <persName>Usu-midori</persName> or Light-green. And this was because it came
forth from the spring mountains of <placeName>Kumano</placeName>; for in summer the
hills of that place are of a deep-green colour, but in spring they
are light-green. And from the time that he possessed this
sword the men of the <placeName>San-in</placeName> and <placeName>San-yo</placeName> districts and the
warriors of the <placeName>Nankai-do</placeName> and <placeName>Sankai-do</placeName>, who had up till this
time been on the side of the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, renounced their allegiance
and came over to the <orgName>Genji</orgName>.
</p>
<p>
Then on the third day of the second month the <orgName>Genji</orgName> went
<pb n="342" xml:id="p356-342"/>

forth from the Capital and marched to <placeName>Ichi-no-tani</placeName>, and there
the army was divided into two parts, and <persName>Noriyori</persName> with fifty
thousand horsemen advanced into <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, while the reserve
under <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> set out from <placeName>Mikusayama</placeName>. From the hour
of the Hare (6 p.m.) until the hour of the Snake (10 a.m.) of
the seventh day both armies fought fiercely with one accord,
and victory rested with the <orgName>Genji</orgName>, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> fleeing as best they
might. Their Commander <persName>Echizen-no-Sammi Michimori</persName> and
eight others of their nobles were slain, and on the thirteenth day
their heads were carried through the streets of the Capital and
fixed on the gibbet. As a reward for their success in this battle,
on the sixth day of the eighth month <persName>Kuro Onzoshi</persName> became
<persName>Saemon-no-kami</persName>, and soon afterwards by a special Edict of the
<persName>Ho-o</persName> he was promoted to Go-i-no-Jo, being known as <persName>Taiyu
Hogwan</persName>, while <persName>Kaba-no-Onzoshi</persName> was made <persName>Mikawa-no-kami</persName>.
</p>
<p>
On the eleventh day of the second month of the second year
they again set out against the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and when the ships were
about to start at <placeName>Watanabe</placeName> and <placeName>Kansaki</placeName>, <persName>Kuro Hogwan</persName> and
<persName>Kajiwara Heizo</persName> fell into a dispute as to whether a back-water
oar should or should not be fitted, and enmity arose between
them. But <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>, not at all in fear of the violent gale that
blew, crossed over with but fifty ships and fifty horsemen,
whereas <persName>Kajiwara</persName>, who feared the storm, did not arrive until the
day after. With the help of a guide <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> attacked and
burned the buildings at <placeName>Yashima</placeName>, and on the twenty second day
of the third month he reached <placeName>Akamagaseki</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Nagato</placeName>. <persName>Noriyori</persName> with the warriors of <placeName>Kyushu</placeName> headed for
<placeName>Moji-no-seki</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Buzen</placeName>, so that the <orgName>Heike</orgName> host
was taken between them and the last desperate fight began.
The <persName>Heike</persName> were at length defeated, and the <persName>Nii Dono</persName>, taking
the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> in her arms, sprang with him into the sea, while
the former <persName>Naidaijin Munemori</persName> and thirty eight others were
captured alive. The <roleName>Hogwan</roleName> fought in many battles but never
even received a wound, and in every one he was victorious,
making a great name for himself throughout the whole Empire;
<pb n="343" xml:id="p357-343"/>

and all this was solely on account of the might of this ancestral
blade. Thus he subdued all the <placeName>Nankaido</placeName> and <placeName>Saikaido</placeName> and
returned to the Capital carrying with him the captive leaders of
the <orgName>Heike</orgName>, and restored the Three Sacred Treasures to the
Imperial City. Only of the Three Sacred Treasures he brought
back but the Mirror and the Jewel, for the Sacred Sword was
lost in the sea.
</p>
<p>
Now the <term>Jewel</term>, the <term>Sword</term> and the <term>Mirror</term> are the Three
Sacred Treasures of our Imperial Throne, and the <term>Jewel</term> has
been handed down from the age of the gods, and is kept in a
marked casket as a talisman to protect each generation of
Sovereigns. And this casket is never opened, so that no one
has seen what is in it. The <persName>Emperor Go-Rei-zei-in</persName> for some
reason or other tried to open the casket, but when he took off
the lid immediately a white cloud rose from within it.
After a
while the cloud returned again as it was, and <persName>Kii-no-Naiji</persName>
replaced the lid and tied it down again. <placeName>Nippon</placeName> is a small
country, but in this thing it surpasses even great ones. If the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> himself, Lord of the mightiest powers, was not
permitted to see it, how should ordinary people do so, much
less any others of lesser rank still?
</p>
<p>
Now this Sacred <term>Jewel</term> has on it letters showing it to be the
seal of a god. And how it was that the seal of a god came to
become the Sacred Treasure of the Imperial House is not clear,
but if we search carefully into the matter, it may be revealed in
the origin of our country. <persName>Kunitoko-tachi-no-Mikoto</persName> the first
of the seven generations of Heavenly Deities, let down his
Celestial Spear to see if there was any country beneath, and
sounded to the bottom of the ocean, but finding no land drew it
up again, when a drop that fell from the point of it congealed
and hardened and became an island. And as a presage of the
birth of our country there appeared floating on the waves of the
sea the characters <term>Dai-Nichi</term>; and as it was on these characters
that the drop from the spear stood and became an island, the
name of <placeName>Dai-Nippon</placeName> was given to the country. And it was the
<pb n="344" xml:id="p358-344"/>

island of <placeName>Awaji</placeName> that was the origin of <placeName>Nippon</placeName>. From <persName>Kunitoko-
tachi-no-Mikoto</persName> the next three generations were male deities;
there were no female ones. In the following three generations
from <persName>U-hiji-ni-no-Mikoto</persName> of the fourth generation to <persName>Omo-daru-no-Mikoto</persName> of the sixth there were both male and female deities,
but they did not marry. In the seventh generation <persName>Izanagi</persName> and
<persName>Izanami-no-Mikoto</persName> descended to the isle of <placeName>Awaji</placeName> and there
married. Then they planted the mountains, rocks, herbs and
trees, and created the great <placeName>Land of Eight Islands</placeName>, after which
they created many countries, and since there was as yet no
master in the world, they bore one daughter and three sons,
<persName>Hi-no-kami</persName>, <persName>Tsuki-no kami</persName>, <persName>Hiruko</persName> and <persName>Susa-no-o-no-Mikoto</persName>.
<persName>Hi-no-kami</persName>, the Deity of the sun, that is <persName>Ten-sho-dai-jin</persName> the
Deity of the <placeName>Dai-jingu</placeName> or Shrine of <placeName>Ise</placeName>; and <persName>Tsuki-no-kami</persName>, the
Moon Deity, is <persName>Tsuki-yomi-no-Mikoto</persName>, who is called <persName>Takano
Niu Daimyojin</persName>. As for <persName>Hiruko</persName>, since this deity was not able to
stand on his feet for three years, he was put into a celestial boat
of camphor wood and set adrift on the ocean, whereupon he
floated till he came to the province of <placeName>Settsu</placeName>, becoming the
Deity of the Sea, and revealing himself as <persName>Ebisu Saburo Dono</persName>
whose dwelling is at <placeName>Nishi-no-miya</placeName>. <persName>Susa-no-o-no-Mikoto</persName> was a
deity of uproarious temper and was banished to the province of
<placeName>Izumo</placeName>, where he afterwards became the deity of the Great
Shrine. Thus <persName>Izanagi</persName> and <persName>Izanami-no-Mikoto</persName> gave this country
to <persName>Tensho-daijin</persName>, and the mountains to <persName>Tsuki-yomi-no-Mikoto</persName>,
while <persName>Hiruko</persName> received the sea as his domain, but <persName>Susa-no-o no
Mikoto</persName> got nothing, and so he often fought with his brethren,
and for this unfilial conduct he was banished to the land of
<placeName>Izumo</placeName>.
</p>
<p>
But though <persName>Tensho-daijin</persName> had thus received the land of
<placeName>Nippon</placeName> she was unable to govern it according to her will, for
<persName>Mara</persName> of the <placeName>Six Devalokas</placeName>, the Lord of Evil who dwelt in the
<placeName>Paranirmita Vas'avartin</placeName>, held possession of the <placeName>Six Devalokas</placeName> to
do as he would therein. And since the land of <placeName>Nippon</placeName> was
beneath the <placeName>Six Devalokas</placeName>, he claimed that it fell within his
<pb n="345" xml:id="p359-345"/>

sphere and should be under his authority. But seeing that this
country was an island that had its birth on the characters
<term>Dai-Nichi</term>, it must be a land devoted to the Law of <persName>Buddha</persName>, and
in that case its inhabitants would be able to escape from the
circle of birth and death, so he wished to keep it entirely in his
own power, so that no people should be suffered to live there,
and so Buddhism might be prevented from spreading. And as
he would not allow her, <persName>Tensho-daijin</persName> could do nothing, and so
three hundred and fifteen thousand years passed. So after this
long period the Deity sought out <persName>Mara</persName> to obtain permission and
said to him; "If you will grant me to take possession of the
land that has been given to me, I will not let the Buddhist Law
or Priesthood come nigh it." And when <persName>Mara</persName> heard this he
opposed her no further and permitted it on this condition; and
when this permission was given, the Deity sealed it in token of
agreement. And this seal is the Sacred <term>Jewel</term>.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the Sacred <term>sword</term>, it appears that there
were two Divine Blades handed down from the Age of the
Gods, and these are <persName>Ame-no-murakumo-no-tsurugi</persName> and <persName>Ame-no-
haha-kiri-no-tsurugi</persName>. Of these it is the first, <persName>Ame-no-murakumo-no-tsurugi</persName>, which is the Sacred <term>sword</term> or Divine Talisman of the
Sovereigns. In the sixth month of the first year of the era
Shu-cho, during the reign of <persName>Temmu Tenno</persName>, it was deposited in
the shrine of <placeName>Atsuta</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName>. <persName>Ame-no-haha-
kiri-no-tsurugi</persName> was formerly called <persName>Totsuka-no-tsurugi</persName>, or the
Ten-handbreadth sword, but after the slaying of the great
serpent it was re-named <persName>Ame-no-haha-kiri-no-tsurugi</persName>. This was
because the serpent's tail was called '<foreign xml:lang="ja">haha</foreign>.' It was also called
'<foreign xml:lang="ja">orochi</foreign>.' And this sword was afterwards deposited in the
shrine of <placeName>Iso-no-kami-furu</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Yamato</placeName>. In
ancient days, when <persName>Susa-no-o-no-Mikoto</persName> resided in the province
of <placeName>Izumo</placeName>, a great serpent lived in the mountains about the upper
waters of the River <placeName>Hi</placeName> in that province, and it had eight heads
and tails, and its eight tails filled eight valleys. Its eyes were
like the sun and moon, and on its back moss grew, and all
<pb n="346" xml:id="p360-346"/>

manner of trees and herbs sprouted. Year by year it swallowed
up men, so that children mourned their swallowed parents
and parents lamented for their swallowed children, and from
the villages on the south and north the sound of wailing
went up continually. So the whole population of the land was
destroyed, and two Mountain Deities, <persName>Te-nazu-chi</persName> and his wife
<persName>Ashi-nazu-chi</persName> alone were left. They had an only daughter
named <persName>Inada-hime</persName>, aged eight, and placing her between them
they mourned and wept without ceasing. <persName>Susa-no-o-no-Mikoto</persName>
felt compassion for them and asked what the matter was,
whereupon the Deity <persName>Te-nazu-chi</persName> answered and said: We weep or
our dearly loved only daughter <persName>Inada-hime</persName>, who will be
devoured this night by the eight-forked serpent. "Will you give the
maiden to me if I slay the serpent ?" answered he, taking pity on
them. Then <persName>Te-nazu-chi</persName> and <persName>Ashi-na-zuchi</persName> rejoiced greatly and
replied; "If you will kill the great serpent we will gladly give
you our daughter." Then the Deity made a plan to slay the
great serpent. Making up a lofty bed, he dressed <persName>Inada-hime</persName>
in splendid attire and sticking a Yuzu-tsuma comb in her hair,
stood her thereon. On all four sides he kindled fires around it,
and beyond the fires he placed jars full of sake on eight sides.
At midnight came the eight-forked serpent to devour <persName>Inada-
hime</persName>, and saw her on top of the bed, but as the fires were
burning all round her he could not approach. Then, as he
stood gazing at her, he saw her reflexion cast into the jars of
sake, and in great jubilation he thrust all his eight heads into the
eight jars and drank hard and long, after which, overcome by
his load of liquor, he sank down prostrate and oblivious of all
about him. Then the Deity drew his sword and hewed him to
pieces, but when he came to the tails his sword was stopped by
something. Looking in surprise he saw that the edge of the
sword was turned, and when he tore the tail open, behold! there
was another sword within it. As it was a very excellent blade
he presented it to <persName>Ten-sho-daijin</persName>. It was called <persName>Ame-no-mura-
kumo-no-tsurugi</persName>, and the reason for this name was that when it
<pb n="347" xml:id="p361-347"/>

was in the tail of the serpent black clouds always covered it, and
so it was called "cloud-cluster'sword. Now wind went forth
from the tail of this great serpent and rain fell from its head. It
was the Dragon-king of the winds and waters that descended to
the earth. Then <persName>Te-nazuchi</persName>, rejoicing that his daughter's life
was saved, gave her in marriage to the Deity, and presented him
with a mirror three feet six inches in circumference, and when
<persName>Inada-hime</persName> went to him she threw behind her the comb that was
stuck in her hair: and this is what is called 'the comb of parting.'
</p>
<p>
So <persName>Susa-no-o-no-Mikoto</persName> built a Palace in the land of <placeName>Izumo</placeName> and
lived there with <persName>Inada-hime</persName> as his wife, and feeling remorse for
the trouble he had caused his elder brethren, he gave to <persName>Tensho-
daijin</persName> the sword <persName>Ame-no-murakumo-no-tsurugi</persName> which he had taken
from the tail of the great serpent, the blade <persName>Ame-no-haha-kiri-no-
tsurugi</persName>, and the mirror which he had received as a bridal gift
from <persName>Te-nazu-chi</persName>, and so his unfilial conduct was forgiven.
And it is this mirror that is the <term>Naiji-dokoro</term>, or Sacred <term>Mirror</term>.
</p>
<p>
In the reign of <persName>Itoku Tenno</persName>, the fourth earthly Sovereign,
three mirrors fell from heaven; one was this bridal mirror, the
other two were those which <persName>Ten-sho-daijin</persName> made when she shut
herself into the <placeName>Heavenly-rock-dwelling</placeName>, that the reflection of her
features might be preserved therein, and that when her
descendants looked on them they might see as it were herself.
The
first that was made was small, and so another was made.
And
the first is that which is worshipped in the shrine of <placeName>Hi-no-kuma</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Kii</placeName>, while the second is attached to a rock
about one ri off the coast of <placeName>Futami-no-ura</placeName> in the province of
<placeName>Ise</placeName>; and when the tide rises it comes up upon the rock, and
when it ebbs it falls again; and formerly they used to go over
thither in a boat, when the sea was calm, and worship it. And
the bridal mirror is the Sacred <term>Mirror</term> which is kept in the
Palace as the Imperial Talisman. But in the days of <persName>Sujin
Tenno</persName>, the tenth Sovereign, the hall where it was kept became
unsuitable, so a new one was built and a new mirror cast, the
old one being given back to <persName>Ten-sho-daijin</persName>. And this newly cast
<pb n="348" xml:id="p362-348"/>

mirror, as well as the sword which was re-made were not at
all inferior to the original ones in Divine Virtue. But in the
fortieth year of <persName>Kei-ko Tenno</persName>, the twelfth Sovereign, many of
the Eastern Barbarians rebelled against the Imperial Rule, and
the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName> were disquieted, so the second Imperial
Prince <persName>Yamato-take-no-Mikoto</persName>, who was a most intrepid wrrior
of great strength, was sent to bring them to subjection. In the
tenth month of the winter of the same year he set out, and
going first to the shrine of <placeName>Ise</placeName> he told the priestess <persName>Yamato-hime-no-Mikoto</persName> that by the Imperial Command he was going to
smite the Eastern Barbarians, and she brought forth the sword
<persName>Ame-no-murakumo</persName> which had been given back in the
days of <persName>Sujin Tenno</persName>. <persName>Yamato-take</persName> girded it on and went
on his way down to the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>, but as he was on
the road a strange thing happened; the great eight-forked
serpent that had been injured by <persName>Susa-no-o-no-Mikoto</persName> in the
land of <placeName>Izumo</placeName> came down from heaven and rudely sought his
life. His wrath at having been deprived of the sword had not
abated, so he determined to stop <persName>Yamato-take-no-Mikoto</persName>, who
had just girded it on to march against the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName>,
and take it from him, and with this intent he became a poisonous
serpent and lay in wait for him at <placeName>Fuwa-no-seki</placeName>. But the
Prince paid no heed to him, but sprang over him and went on to
the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName>, where he stayed in the house of a certain
<persName>Gendaiyu</persName> at a place called <placeName>Matsuko-no-shima</placeName>. And <persName>Gendaiyu</persName>
had a daughter whose name was <persName>Iwato-hime</persName>, a maiden of
graceful form and lovely face, whom the Prince summoned to
his presence, and who found favour with him so that they spent
that night in mutual love. So deep was their affection that they
would have desired to stay together, but since the Prince felt
that it would not be right to allow such dalliance with a lady to
interrupt his expedition against the Barbarians, he soon started
off again, promising to meet her again on his return. Coming
to the slopes of Mount <placeName>Fuji</placeName> in the province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName>, some evil
fellows of the men of that country met him and invited him to
<pb n="349" xml:id="p363-349"/>

hunt the stags which were very plentiful in the moorland, but
when he went forth to do so, these rascals fired the moor with
intent to burn His Augustness to death. Then the Prince drew
the sword <persName>Ame-no-murakumo-no-tsurugi</persName> and with it mowed
down the grass, so that the fire caught the swathes and menaced
his enemies. Moreover he had with him also two stones, called
the stone of fire and the stone of water, and he straightway cast
the latter, whereupon water issued from it and put out the fire;
after which he threw the stone of fire, which vomited forth
flames and consumed these worthless fellows. And by reason
of this matter that moor was called <placeName>Ame-no-yakesome-no</placeName>, or
the Moor-of-the-Burning, while <persName>Ame-no-murakumo-no-tsurugi</persName>
was re-named <persName>Kusa-nagi-no-tsurugi</persName>, or Grass-mowing sword.
</p>
<p>
Now the Prince could not forget <persName>Iwato-hime</persName> whom he had left
behind, and wished to let her know the state of his feelings at
whatever cost: so he flung the stone of fire and the stone of
water from the slopes of <placeName>Fuji</placeName> to <placeName>Matsuko-no-shima</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Suruga</placeName>, and they fell, the one on the northern part and
the other on the southern part of the rice-fields cultivated by a
certain <persName>Kidaiyu</persName>. And during the one night that they rested
there, the southern part on which the stone of water fell became a
wood covered with thick trees, while on the northern part,
however great floods might appear, no water was ever seen; but on
the other part water was never lacking even in the greatest
drought. These things were owing to the virtue of the two
stones.
</p>
<p>
Then His Augustness the <persName>Prince Yamato-take</persName> journeyed
on into the country and subdued all evil-doers, pacifying also the
bad deities of all these places, after which he returned to the
province of <placeName>Owari</placeName> in the fifty third year of his father's reign, and
once more rejoiced in the love of <persName>Iwato-hime</persName>. But as this could
not last for eyer he again set out for the Capital, leaving he: the
sword <persName>Kusa-nagi</persName> as a memento of him. "But as I am a
woman," she said, "of what use can a sword be to me?' As,
however, the prince still urged her to take it, thinking there
<pb n="350" xml:id="p364-350"/>

was some reason, she hung it on the branch of a mulberry tree,
and His Augustness departed for the Capital.
</p>
<p>
Now the eight-forked great serpent <persName>Ibuki Daimyojin</persName>,
resentful that the Prince had jumped over him before and
escaped, came forth on the road in greater bulk than ever to
intercept him, but His Augustness paid no more heed to him
than on the former occasion, and sprang clear over him and
passed on. This time, however, the tip of his foot touched the
serpent as he leapt, and before long he was seized with a fever
that spread through his whole body, and though enduring it
with difficulty, so stubborn was his spirit that he would by no
means lie down, but in great suffering continued his journey as
Example               far as the province of <placeName>Oini</placeName>. Sitting down on a stone by the
roadside where a cold clear spring of water was flowing forth,
the Prince bathed his foot in the stream, and as he thus stood in
it, the coolness of the water caused the fever to abate. There-
fore is the name of this stream called <placeName>Samegai</placeName>, or The Well of
Cooling. But though the fever subsided, his sickness was still
heavy upon him, so after dedicating the captive Barbarians to
the great shrine of <placeName>Ise</placeName> and sending <persName>Takehiko</persName> to announce it,
unable to do more, he lay down at <placeName>Sen-no-matsubara</placeName> in the
province of <placeName>Omi</placeName>. Meanwhile at <placeName>Matsuko-no-shima</placeName> <persName>Iwato-hime</persName>,
felt so lonely after his departure that at length she could contain
herself no longer, and started out for the Capital to seek him,
and on the way came to <placeName>Sen-no-matsubara</placeName>. As the Prince
lay on his sick-bed, he was thinking of her and longing to see
her, so when his eyes fell on her once again, in a transport of
joy he exclaimed; "Aah Tsuma! Oh, my wife!" and since
that the <placeName>Eastern Provinces</placeName> are called <placeName>Azuma</placeName>. But as time went
on the Prince's condition became worse, and at last he died, and
was changed into a white bird which flew away toward the
south. <persName>Iwato-hime</persName> mourned and lamented in the utmost grief
at the death of His Augustness, but as all was unavailing she
returned weeping to <placeName>Owari</placeName>. The Prince's followers, in their
grief at parting from their master, followed him as he went, and
<pb n="351" xml:id="p365-351"/>

after coming down to rest a while in the district of <placeName>Nagusa</placeName> in
the province of <placeName>Kii</placeName>, this place seemed not to please him, and he
flew back again toward the East and came to <placeName>Matsuko-no-shima</placeName>
in the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName>. When he was flying in the form of
a white bird, he appeared like two white banners ten feet long;
and the place where he alighted in the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName> was
called <placeName>Shira-tori Tsuka</placeName>, or the <placeName>Mound of the White Bird</placeName>, while
from the appearance of the banners falling there is a place called
<placeName>Hataya</placeName>, or <placeName>House of Banners</placeName>, and it was no doubt because
<persName>Hyoye-no-suke Yoritomo</persName> was to become the chief of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
in the future that he was born in this place.
</p>
<p>
Now <persName>Iwato-hime</persName> took down the sword <persName>Kusa-nagi</persName> which
she had hung on the branch of a mulberry tree, and stood it
against a sugi tree of the shrine in the wood that had grown up in
a single night on the field of <persName>Kidaiyu</persName>, and every night fire flashed
forth from it so that the sugi tree was burned down; and as this
burned cedar fell into the ricefield, the field also became hot,
therefore is the name of it called <placeName>Atsuta</placeName> or <placeName>Hotfield</placeName>. And
<persName>Yamato-take-no-Mikoto</persName> flew thither in the form of a white bird
and alighted, and became a god; and he is the present <persName>Atsuta
Daimyojin</persName>. <persName>Iwato-hime</persName>, thus parted from her ever-beloved
lord, became manifest as a deity too, while <persName>Gendaiyu</persName> and <persName>Kidai-
yu</persName> became gods also. And they built a shrine and deposited
the sword <persName>Kusa-nagi-no-tsurugi</persName> therein, and every night a light
flashed forth from it. But none save virtuous men learned in
the Law might see it. Moreover a certain priest of <placeName>Shiragi</placeName>, a
<term>S'ramanera</term> of high rank named <persName>Dogyo</persName>, seeing the light that
flashed from this sword in <placeName>Nippon</placeName>, told the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> of his
country, which when the <roleName>Emperor</roleName> heard he bade him get the
sword and present it to him. So the priest crossed over to
<placeName>Nippon</placeName> and went as a pilgrim to <placeName>Atsuta</placeName>, where, after
worshipping for seven days, he contrived to steal the sword, and
wrapping it in the folds of his <term>kesa</term> of five breadths, fled away with it.
But the sword cut its way out of the <term>kesa</term> and went back to the
shrine. Again he returned and stayed in the shrine yet another
<pb n="352" xml:id="p366-352"/>

seven days, and took the sword and wrapped it in a <term>kesa</term> of
seven breadths and went off. But again the sword tore its way
out of the <term>kesa</term> and returned to the shrine. Once more he went
back and stayed another seven days, and on this occasion he
took a <term>kesa</term> of nine breadths of stuff, and this time the sword
could not get out, and he carried it off as far as <placeName>Hakata</placeName> in
<placeName>Tsukushi</placeName>. Then the <persName>Deity of Atsuta</persName>, incensed at his
presumption, sent down the <persName>Sumiyoshi Daimyojin</persName> to smite him, and he
kicked <persName>Dogyo</persName> to death and recovered the sword. At this the
<roleName>Emperor</roleName> of <placeName>Shiragi</placeName> gave seven swords to a certain general
named <persName>Ike-Fudo</persName> and sent him to <placeName>Nippon</placeName>. <persName>Ike-Fudo</persName> fought his
way as far as the province of <placeName>Owari</placeName>, when the <persName>Deity of Atsuta</persName>
kicked him also to death in his indignation, and taking the seven
swords added them to <persName>Kusa-nagi</persName> and laid them up in the shrine,
and thus it is that he is now called <persName>Yatsurugi-no-Daimyojin</persName>, or
the Deity of Eight Swords. Then, after many generations had
passed, the <orgName>Heike</orgName> took one of these other sacred swords in which
no divine spirit resided, and went forth from the Capital, and the
<persName>Nii-Dono</persName> girded it on and leaped into the sea. Greatly grieving
that what had been preserved from such ancient days should
now be lost in this generation, they procured divers to search
for it, but skilled as they were they could not find it. This was
because the Dragon Sea-god had taken it and laid it up in his
Palace beneath the waves. But a certain person had a dream
concerning this <persName>Kusa-nagi-no-tsurugi</persName> to the effect that the
<persName>Dragon King of the Winds and Waters</persName>, since when in the form
of the Eight-forked Serpent he had been attacked by <persName>Susa-no-o-
no Mikoto</persName> and the sword taken from him, being really <persName>Ibuki
Daimyojin</persName>, again took the form of a serpent at <placeName>Fuwa-no-seki</placeName>
and tried to stop <persName>Yamato-take-no-Mikoto</persName>, who had received it
from the <placeName>Great Shrine of Ise</placeName>, but could not, and so made
another attempt when the Prince was returning to the Capital,
but was there killed. Afterwards he again appeared under the
guise of <persName>Ike-Fudo</persName> and also in the form of the eight-year old
<roleName>Emperor</roleName>, but was unable to get the real sword, and only
<pb n="353" xml:id="p367-353"/>

obtained the later one, with which he sank down to the bottom
of the waters of the <placeName>Western Sea</placeName>, and as he deposited it in the
<placeName>Palace of the Dragon Sea-god</placeName> it could not be found.
</p>
<p>Now <persName>Kuro Hogwan Yoshitsune</persName> proceeded to the <placeName>Eastern
Provinces</placeName> with the <orgName>Heike</orgName> captives, but owing to the slanders of
<persName>Kajiwara</persName> he was not allowed to enter <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>, but stayed
outside at <placeName>Koshigoe</placeName>. Greatly regretting this estrangement, he
wrote a letter vowing his good faith, but though he sent it many
times it was of no avail, and so, as there was nothing more to be
done he started back towards the Capital, but on the
way he
went to the shrine of the <persName>Hakone Gongen</persName> and offered the sword
<persName>Usumidori</persName>, entreating the Deity to bring about a reconciliation
with his brother. Then <persName>Tosa-bo Shoshun</persName> came up to the
Capital and plotted to take his life, but the <roleName>Hogwan</roleName> discovered
it, and <persName>Tosa-bo</persName> fled into the recesses of <placeName>Mount Kurama</placeName> to <placeName>Sojo-go-dani</placeName>. But the monks of <placeName>Kurama</placeName> remembered their ancient
friendship, and seized him and handed him over to <persName>Yoshitsune</persName>,
who gave orders to <persName>Nakatsukasa-no-jo Tomokuni</persName> that he be
put to death at <placeName>Rokujo</placeName> to the west of <placeName>Shujaku</placeName>. Then, hearing
that another force was coming up against him from the East,
<persName>Yoshitsune</persName> put out in a ship with five hundred horsemen on the
<placeName>Western Sea</placeName>, but meeting with a great storm he was carried to
the shore of <placeName>Naniwa</placeName>, and accompanied only by a <term>Shirabyoshi</term>
named <persName>Shizuka</persName> he fled to the mountains of <placeName>Yoshino</placeName>. After-
wards, making for the north, he escaped as far as <placeName>Mutsu</placeName>, and
spent three or four years there under the protection of <persName>Hidehira
Nyudo</persName>, but on the twenty ninth day of the fourth month of the
fourth year of Bun-ji, <persName>Yasuhira</persName> came against him with five
hundred horsemen, when, after fighting to the last, he, then
aged thirty one, with his wife aged twenty two, and a little son
and daughter both four years of age, put an end to their lives
and died. Thus by his giving the sword to the shrine of the
<persName>Gongen</persName>, even though he had not been reconciled with his
brother, we might know that his fate was sealed.
</p>
<p>
Now on the night of the twenty eighth day of the fifth
<pb n="354" xml:id="p368-354"/>
month of the fourth year of the Kenkyu era, the two brothers
<persName>Soga-no-Juro Sukenari</persName> and <persName>Soga-no-Goro Tokimune</persName> of <placeName>Sagami</placeName>
received from <persName>Yukizane</persName>, the <persName>Betto</persName> of the <placeName>Hakone</placeName> shrine, a sword
called <persName>Hyogo-kusari-no-tachi</persName>, that they might take vengeance on
the enemy of their father, and were enabled thus to carry out
their plan as they intended. And this sword was none other
than the blade <persName>Usu-midori</persName> which <persName>Yoshitsune</persName> had presented, and
which was originally known as <persName>Hiza-maru</persName>. And that they
were able to accomplish their vengeance on their father's foe,
and thus win a great name and renown through the whole
Empire, was solely through the virtue of this sword. After
this <persName>Hiza-maru</persName> was given to <persName>Yoritomo</persName>, so that the two blades
<persName>Hige-kiri</persName> and <m>Hiza-maru</m>, the hereditary treasures of the <orgName>Genji</orgName>
family, which <persName>Tada-no-Mitsunaka</persName> had received from <persName>Hachiman
Dai-bosatsu</persName>, though for a while separated from each other, at
last came together again, as a most auspicious omen, in the
possession of the Lord of <placeName>Kamakura</placeName>.
