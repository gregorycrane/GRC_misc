<p>It was Danaus our sire, chief in our counsels and leader of our cause, that determined on this move as the honourablest choice of evils, to fly pell-mell across the ocean-billow and put in at the shore of Argos: for thence it is hath grown this race of ours that claims its origin from the sting-tormented Cow by laying on of the hands of Zeus and by the breathing of his spirit.</p>

Aeschylus frequently breaks up his Chorus into separate voices, excitedly interrupting one another or expressing different views; but the MSS. hardly ever afford any indication of such dialogue, a neglect which has caused perhaps more trouble than any other. At the end of this play (1054 sqq.) there is an animated altercation between the two parties that I conjecture in this passage.</note>

The desire of Zeus is ill to seize: everywhere, even in <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="90"/> the darkness, the flame of it burns but in obscure sort<ref n="114.1">1</ref> before the eyes of human folks—</p>
<p>But safe, and not upon its back,<ref n="114.2">2</ref> a matter falls if the fulfilment of it be ordained by the nod of Zeus.</p>
<p>—for dark and tangled stretch the paths of his intent, <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="100"/> past understanding to discern.</p>
<p>Down from their towering imaginations he hurleth mortals to perdition, yet equips no force:—even from his holy throne, whereas he sitteth, his unlaboured Harmony<ref n="114.3">3</ref>



<note type="footnote" n="114.1">1 Even when it should show plain against the background of the night. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύχη, μοίρα</foreign>, and even <foreign xml:lang="grc">κήρ</foreign> are used poetically of the 'character' or 'portion' with which anything is endowed.</note>

<note type="footnote" n="114.2">2 A racy metaphor such as those from bowls, archery, tennis in our Elizabethans. Only a fall upon the back counted as a fair throw; if upon the shoulder, for example, it was a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψευδόπτωμα</foreign>: <bibl>Ar. <title>Eq.</title> 571</bibl>, <bibl><title>A.

Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπονον</foreign> is due to Wellauer, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥμενος</foreign> to Paley; the rest I have restored. Aeschylus uses the metaphor again in <cit><bibl><title>P. V.</title> 569</bibl>, <quote xml:lang="grc">οὔποτε τὰν Διὸς ἁρμονίαν θνατῶν παρεξίασι βουλαί</quote></cit>, which it is strange no critic should have remarked to be one of his numerous Pythagoreanisms. The whole ordered universe (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</foreign>, mundus) was conceived by Pythagoras, using musical symbolism, as a harmony: see e.g. <bibl>Zeller <title>Greek Philosophy</title> I. 465, 507</bibl>. And with God this complicated Scheme works, in Mr Kipling's phrase, <cit><quote>'wheel within wheel to the ordered, effortless end'</quote> (<bibl><title>A Fleet in Being</title>, p. 60</bibl>)</cit>.

<note type="footnote" n="148.1">1 Not only the words, but the punctuation and construction of this passage are uncertain. I suspect that <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρπώματα</foreign> should be <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηπεύματα</foreign>, 'gardens' cultivated by irrigation, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρπεύματα</foreign> has been altered to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηπεύματα</foreign> in another case by Hermann (<title>Opusc.</title> i. p. 55). <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθωσμένην ἐρῶ</foreign> I have little doubt should be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεωγμέν' ἱμέρῳ</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεωγμένην</foreign> had been conjectured by Tucker).</note>

<p>And ye handmaids, take up the strain, and let this the Pelasgians' country be the subject of our praise, and no more let the homage of our hymns be paid to the outpourings of the Nile:</p>
<p>But to the rivers that through this country pour their gentle draught and give it increase, with their rich flood solacing her soil.</p>
<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1040"/>
<p>And may pure Artemis look with compassion on this band, and marriage never come through constraint of Cytherea: that prize be the portion of my enemies!</p>
<p>Yet is not Cypris disregarded by this friendly hymn; she shares with Hera power nearest removed from Zeus; and in august rites is the subtle-witted goddess honoured:</p>
<p>And leagued in their Mother's company are Desire and <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1050"/> she to whom nothing is denied, winning Persuasion; also upon Harmonia hath been bestowed a share in Aphrodite,<ref n="149.1">1</ref> and (upon) the whispering dalliance of the Loves.</p>
<p>But for the fugitives I have boding fears of vengeance yet<ref n="149.2">2</ref> and sore distress and bloody war:—what means it that they have effected a successful voyage in swiftly-sped pursuit?</p>
<p>What is fated, that will come to pass. The mighty untranscended will of Zeus may not be overstepped: may <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1060"/> this marriage prove as in many other women's case before us!<ref n="149.3">3</ref></p>
<p>May mighty Zeus defend me from wedlock with Aegyptus' race!</p>
<p>That would be best; but thou wouldst move the immoveable.</p>

<p>And thou knowest not what shall be!</p>
<p>Why how should I discern the mind of Zeus, a sight unfathomable? Prithee let the words of thy prayer be <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1070"/> moderate!</p>

<note type="footnote" n="150.1">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καιρός</foreign> is the 'right point' of time or place, and hence is often synonymous as here with <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέτρον</foreign>.</note>

<note type="footnote" n="150.2">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲν ἄγαν</foreign>: the verb is formed as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιάζειν</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">λίαν</foreign>.</note>

He took it to mean 'stayed from her distress'; but elsewhere it is a synonym of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάσχετος</foreign>, and so I have translated it, referring it to Io's condition before she was restored again to her human form—the aorist participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτίσας</foreign> having thus the same value as in Soph. <title>Aj.</title> 675 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύει πεδήσας</foreign>.</p>
    <p>The drift is 'May this only be a temporary trial; may Zeus, after subjecting us to all this tribulation, set us free again, and refrain from inflicting upon us finally the union we abhor.' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποστεροίη</foreign> is 'withhold.'</p></note>
