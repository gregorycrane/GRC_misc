INTRODUCTORY ESSAY ON THE LANGUAGE OF SOPHOCLES.
</head>

<p>
 The language of the Greek writers of the fifth century в. с. ехhibits a degree of variety, which contrasts equally with the uniformity of Epic poetry and the comparative sameness of Xenophon and the Athenian orators. In no period of any literature do there exist so many linguistic differences between writers who were almost contemporary. These are not simply matters of dialect, and are not adequately described as peculiarities of style. They appear also in a tentative use of words and grammatical constructions which could only have been allowed even to great original writers in a comparatively early stage of literature. They are characteristic of the time when the most copious and plastic of Western tongues was growing into new forms under a manifold creative impulse, given by minds possessed of extraordinary genius and stimulated to intense activity by changes of national and political life. A wider experience than had found utterance in the recitations of the rhapsodists, or in the simpler tones of the earlier lyric and gnomic poetry, and the growth of reflection, giving at once more concentration to thought and also the power of analysing it, required new vehicles of expression. And the first attempt to frame these in the different kinds of Greek literature led to many novelties of language, some of which did not permanently retain their hold. Each writer had his own tendencies, resulting in anomalies peculiar to him and in an undeveloped but active state both of speech and thought, these licences passed unquestioned and easily found acceptance.
</p>

<p>
 The limits of such divergence were not yet determined by grammatical rules. The race that gave grammar to Europe were by this time not unconscious of the complex structure of their language<note n="1">See the Preface to this edition.</note>, but this consciousness was still indefinite, and was rather an incentive than    <pb n="2"/>  a hindrance to invention. It is not easy for us, who often speak as well as write 'like a book,' to imagine what the art of composition must be in such a period of transition, when every considerable writer is a creative artist, and moulds the materials of common speech and early literature to his purpose according to the bent of his individual genius.
</p>

<p>
 The age of Dante or of Luther occurs once only in the life or history of a language. The poetic faculty does, indeed, whenever it appears, exercise a sensible influence in re-creating or modifying the speech through which the poet works, and such a subtle master as Virgil or Goethe, or our own Shelley, will even at a late period produce new combinations, though commonly without violating the established usage, now fixed by a much longer tradition. But the working of the creative force in the adult state of literature gives no adequate conception of the power with which the same spirit operates in a time of transition, when the old materials are partially fused, and re-cast in other forms. At such moments the original instinct of language, which is never quite dormant, bursts forth with new energy, giving rise to phenomena which are intermediate between the first formation of language and a grammatical rule.
</p>

<p>
 It is of some assistance to the English student of this subject to think of the second or Elizabethan stage of English literature, when the comparatively unreflecting art of Chaucer's age was succeeded by another style to which the revival of literature, last felt in England, and the influence of the Reformation had given birth. New thoughts craved new expression, and the stream of utterance was quickened and disturbed by the influx of ideas. Hence arose peculiarities and diversities of language. Great liveliness and subtlety appear together with a certain want of accuracy. Shakespeare often throws words together in a way that would be impossible now, and it may seem no less strange that Spenser and Shakespeare should have been writing at the same time in England, than that Herodotus and Sophocles, or Sophocles and Euripides, should have been contemporary Greeks. In making this comparison, however, it must be borne in mind that logical analogies are more powerful in Greek than in English. simplicity of ancient art extends also to grammar and diction.
</p>

<p>
 The period of expansion and growth in the Greek language began before Simonides, and the last phase of the process (which, however, can nowhere be regarded as complete) appears in the refinements of Plato. The disturbing influence is least visible in the transparent style of Herodotus, who retains in the new form of prose much of the equability and stateliness of Epic narrative. Though contemporary with Sophocles, he in fact represents an intermediate era, that of the somewhat stationary and complacent civilization of the Ionic cities, which was continued after their political independence was impaired. He preserves, even more largely than the Epic poets did, the <term>paratactic</term> structure, or parallelism, which belongs to a very early phase of syntax. This and other archaic traces in him may be partly due to the oral character of his materials and partly to the logographers who preceded him. His work is the conclusion of a period of continuous growth <pb n="3"/>   amongst the Eastern settlements of the Hellenic race; and while the study of him throws much light both on the language and ideas of Attic tragedy, it is a light that falls on them from behind.
</p>

<p>
 But on the western side of the Aegean there had arisen from the beginning of the century, partly under the influence of the colonies acting on the mother states, a series of writers who used language more artificially, chief amongst whom were Pindar in lyric poetry, Aeschylus and Sophocles in tragedy, and Thucydides the historian. Their art was tentative and irregular, often deserting conventionality with great boldness, and yet straitened by the exigencies of a new endeavour. Under many different forms of ingenuity and refinement, or of abruptness and condensation, we recognise in all of them the struggling of the same creative effort. The tragedians worked under conditions peculiar to themselves, and have a certain external community of character. There grew up, as was natural, a sort of common dialect amongst those who were writing the same species of poetry for the same audience. Yet even amongst the tragic writers the variety is at least as remarkable as the resemblance. There are differences in their mode of using grammatical constructions and in their choice of words, besides marked differences of style, which can be traced even in the fragments. There is nothing in tragedy like the uniformity of Epic diction. The Epic commonplace is parallel to the rhetorical monotony of later writers.<note n="1">With the gradual adaptation of language to the drama may be compared the first use of language by the fathers of Greek philosophy, which is also a sort of experiment, and, like the language of tragedy, is intermediate between poetry and prose.</note>
</p>

<p>
 In order to a complete handling of this subject it would be necessary to consider in the first place the general characteristics of the language of Greek tragedy; distinguishing (1) its relation to the Epic dialect and to the language of Herodotus, (2) the infusion of gnomic and (3) of lyric elements which it contains, (4) the traces of vernacular conversational idiom to be inferred from the comparison of Thucydides, the early orators, and the old Comedy, (5) the effects of the effort towards concentration, observable especially in the frequent use of abstract for concrete, of the cognate accusative, of cases without prepositions, and of the poetical plural.<note n="2">Not much light is to be obtained from the remaining fragments of the predecessors of Aeschylus. It is permissible, however, to conjecture that Choerilus had set the example of using rugged metaphor, while Phrynichus had the melodious smoothness which old-fashioned lovers of poetry in the time of Aristophanes attributed to him, but that in other respects the early dramatists departed little from the simplicity of gnomic verse. On the other hand, of the contemporaries of Sophocles, Achaeus of Eretria seems to have delighted in forced and obscure expressions, and Ion of Chios, as we can partly judge even from the few lines of his poetry which remain, indulged like Sophocles, though in a feebler manner, in experiments of diction.</note>
</p>

<p>
 The scope of the following pages is more limited. I have endeavoured to collect into one view some of the chief idioms which occur in Sophocles, including those which have given most trouble to the    <pb n="4"/>   commentators; and I have arranged them under heads, the greater number of which would be found equally applicable to other Greek authors, especially to the Attic authors of the same period. It would be absurd to represent Sophocles as an eccentric writer. But he made subtle use of a material full of subtlety, which was plastic to his touch, and the resulting lines are more difficult to trace than those which have been impressed by some generally accepted mould.
</p>

<p>
 An obstacle to right interpretation is removed when it is once for all acknowledged that canons, however useful, cannot be strictly applicable to language that is still in process of natural growth, and in which primitive naïveté may be looked for side by side with novel abstractions and modes of thought.

PART I.- GRAMMAR.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="intro">

<p>
In attempting to describe the linguistic peculiarities of Sophocles, I propose to consider, first, grammatical constructions; and secondly, the use of words: and shall begin by characterising the structural peculiarities of the Greek language in general, during the transitional period of which I have already spoken.
</p>
 <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
<p>
In the writers of this period the power of reflecting on language appears rather as a subtle perception of analogies than as a rule of grammar. The mind is feeling after a limit which is not yet clearly prescribed. The genius of logic, inherent in the Greek language from the first, is awakened into fresh activity and has a transforming power over style. The forms of antithesis and inference already begin to complicate expression, and to react on thought, which becomes more self-conscious and less direct and simple.
</p>

<p>
 In this process, which was part of the more general transition from poetry to prose, something was probably due to the change which began some generations earlier, but was still hardly completed, from the habit of oral to that of written composition. The author, who now sat pen in hand with the written page before him, must have become increasingly conscious of analogies of language and modes of thought. This generalized consciousness would be felt and used by him as a new power. Although the ultimate effect of a written literature is to induce a still greater fixity, yet by breaking in upon the conventional sameness of oral composition, the use of writing for a time combined with other causes to bring in a new kind of variety and individuality in the treatment of language. The working of this reflective and logical inventiveness appears chiefly in the opposite forms of analysis and concentration.
</p>

<p>
 The increasing frequency of needlessly minute distinctions, belonging rather to the language than to the thought, the fondness for interrogative and negative expressions, the antithetical structure of whole paragraphs, the perpetual use of the forms of hypothesis, antithesis, and inference, are evidences of the analytical tendency.
</p>

<p>
<pb n="5"/>  The effort of concentration appears in the more complex structure of sentences, and their connection with one another, and in some forms of inference, as well as in the condensation of words and phrases. This concentrating energy seems generally to accompany the poetic instinct in a reflective age, and is a common source of obscurity in the highest literature. For obvious reasons, it has a peculiarly fitting sphere for its operation in the language of tragedy.
</p>

<p>
 A lesser effect of this tendency to reflect on language is the constant attempt to vary and extend the range of idioms, which, ceasing to be used instinctively, are caught up by the fancy of the mind and carried by a sort of metaphor into new applications. The sentences <gloss>are not made, but grow.</gloss> General analogies often prevail over particular uses, and often two currents of logical association meet in one. Hence arise double constructions, changes of construction, and what may be called feeble or imperfect constructions, the government of one word by another being often suggested rather than actually determined. Where language has been fully developed, as in the studied periods of Cicero, the beginning of a sentence is always waiting for the end: the design of the whole is prior to the execution of the parts. But in the stage of language we are considering, the order and coherence of words and clauses are natural rather than grammatical. The meaning breaks upon us as we go along: the antecedent does not <gloss>trammel up the consequence,</gloss> but the apodosis is continually modified by the interference of some intervening word. These are the peculiarities rather than the common characteristicswhich appear with increasing frequency from Homer downwards-the exception, not the rule. It is not of course meant that all the uses of words and constructions in Sophocles or the greater part of them exhibit these qualities, but that there is sufficient to enable us clearly to distinguish between the style of Lucian or Xenophon and that of Sophocles.
</p>

<p>
 The acknowledgment of such an unfixed and growing condition of language may be thought to introduce unnecessarily into the study of Greek syntax an element of uncertainty. And it must be admitted that the attempt to trace constructions beyond grammatical rules is one which may easily degenerate into fanciful subtleties. The study of these varying analogies is more difficult than the ascertainment of a fixed rule, just as curvilinear is more difficult than rectilinear measurement, or as motion is harder to calculate than position. But without attempting in some way to determine the nature of their language, apart from the definitions of a later age, the writers of the transition period can never be thoroughly understood. To require in Sophocles or Thucydides the exact articulation of perfectly grammatical writing would be no less mistaken than to interpret a speech in Coriolanus or Cymbeline as if it were a paragraph of Pope or Johnson. Many conjectural emendations which have been invented to satisfy this unreasonable requirement are found, when rightly weighed, to disturb the real harmony of the composition.
</p>

<p>
 The grammatical consciousness is ever becoming more precise and imposing narrower limits on the use of language. A modern English writer could hardly confuse the singular and plural verb, as was done <pb n="6"/>  continually in the time of Shakespeare<note n="1">It makes no difference that the plural form in s was derived from the Northern English dialect. The confusion existed, and the necessity of clearing it determined the later usage.</note>; nor pass from the second person to the third, nor put 'who' in the objective case, nor omit the nominative, nor interchange the transitive and intransitive verb, nor with the same freedom employ a noun or adverb as a verb, or a verb as a noun,<note n="2">For other instances of Elizabethan freedom, see Mr. Abbott's <title>Shakspearian Grammar</title>.</note> nor speak with Milton of the <gloss>unexpressive nuptial song.</gloss> Even Shelley is hardly permitted, except by his latest editor, to use <quote>loved more</quote> as an equivalent for <quote>felt more love</quote> so as to <quote>include or involve a noun in its cognate verb</quote> (Forman's Shelley, vol. ii. p. 270). Nor could the cultivated Greek of the time of Dionysius, Plutarch, or Longinus, have endured in a contemporary the apparent solecisms which they were quick to observe in Thucydides and other writers of the earlier age. On the other hand, the anomalies of the ante-grammatical writers have an important relation to the abstractions of grammar. They are the symptoms of the first stage of the reflective process which gradually made such experiments impossible, just as the tentative reasonings and even the fallacies of the early philosophers, which could have no existence after the Organon was written, were the necessary antecedents of the Organon.
</p>

<p>
 In Grammar, as in other sciences, the generalizations and distinctions which have been adopted often prove inadequate to the subtlety of the process to be analysed. They are sufficiently applicable to the state of language which they help to perpetuate, though even here they cannot stop the flow of change, but have a less definite relation to the fluctuating analogies of the period in which grammatical structure is a growing framework not yet finally set. The regular grammarian is apt to be baffled or misled in applying his principles to the interpretation of a writer like Thucydides or Sophocles. Yet their so-called irregularities, arising as they do out of the same instinct from which the regular and acknowledged forms of the language have taken their rise, must admit of at least approximate explanation. And there are two ways in which the validity of such a process may be tested: (1) the study of the history of constructions, giving the key to some analogies which the later classification has tended to obscure: (2) if at first sight the method of such interpretation may seem sceptical and fanciful, it is not therefore to be rejected, if supported by a sufficient number of instances either from the same writer or from others. The mere number of such exceptions will prove that they are not merely capricious, but have a rule or principle of their own. It might also tend to prevent vagueness and confusion in such an inquiry, to distinguish between idioms current at the time and idioms of the particular writer. This distinction, however, although real and important, cannot be always accurately observed; partly from our ignorance of the spoken lauguage, and partly because we often cannot tell with certainty how much is due to the genius of a writer, and how much to the habit of his age. In the unfixed state of the Attic dialect, some forms or modes of expression, such as the use  <pb n="7"/>   of the article for the relative, may have been still current in common speech which were afterwards thought to be peculiar to an Epic or Lyric style. And there are probably others which, though passing out of use, were familiar to the hearers of poetry, and from which the 'modern' poet occasionally selected. In the manner of such selection, and in the modification of the selected forms, the characteristic qualities of an author are sure to appear. This is seen chiefly in the general colouring of the language and the choice of words, but is also perceptible in peculiarities of grammatical structure.
</p>

<p>
Sophocles is distinguished in point of syntax from other contemporary writers chiefly by his noble sense of harmony, and by the combination of extreme refinement with moderation and simplicity. He is, to borrow a phrase from Aristotle, ὁμαλῶς ἀνώμαλος : -the first equable writer of the reflective age; for Herodotus, as already noticed, is essentially of an earlier type. The incipient logical analysis, and ethical and political thought, and also the love of condensation, which have such strange effect in the intricate or knotted constructions of Thucydides, are present in Sophocles, and are often in him a cause of uncertainty, but never of harshness. He has neither the ruggedness of Aeschylus, nor the strained ingenuity of Pindar. Like all the greatest writers, he can only be partially studied by the light of his age: he has characteristics of his own, which are best seen by comparing him with other great masters of language in different ages. In the absolute subordination of every tone and emphasis to the dominant feeling, and the perfect adaptation of the language to the degree of tenderness or sternness, of passion or coldness, which is required by the situation, he resembles Virgil and Goethe, and those parts of Shakespeare in which his exuberant invention is most under control. This power of moderation adds greatly to the effect of pathos, in which Sophocles is unsurpassed.
</p>
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
<p>
 The peculiarities of structure in the lyric passages of Sophocles are not essentially different from those in the dialogue. The influence of the earlier lyric poetry is more perceptible in them, just as reminiscences of Homer occur chiefly in the long speeches, and especially in narrative. But both the Epic and Lyric elements, as well as that of common speech, are present everywhere, and are so blended by the poet's art that any broad line of distinction would be illusory. Even the Doric dialect, the traditional vehicle of lyric expression, is only partially assumed, and hardly interferes with the harmony of the general effect. In the following digest of idioms it has been thought sufficient to denote, by the letters <gloss>lyr.</gloss> prefixed, examples taken either from the choral odes or from other lyrical passages. We may therefore here observe the chief particulars in which these differ from the senarii in point of syntax. They are mostly differences of degree. The spirit of fanciful association is more active, and more apt to usurp the place of conventional use. The concentrating effort is more intense, recalling in some passages the spirit of Hebrew poetry. There is more of rapid and abrupt transition, more of substitution <pb n="8"/>  and inversion, of redundance and deficiency. The article is often omitted; prepositions are often added pleonastically. The stress of lyric feeling is combined with the elevation of poetic thought. And the language varies from great simplicity to great complexity, and from the most perfect serenity to the most highly-wrought excitement.

</head>

<p>
   Comparative philology has made familiar the law of decay and regeneration in language, by which inflexions gradually lose their meaning and are replaced by other elements. This process is accompanied by the tendency to analytical expression, which makes the meaning of terminations and prefixes more explicit by the use of auxiliary words. The history of the case-endings affords a striking exemplification of this law. In English, as in most modern languages, there are at most two oblique cases, the possessive and objective, and of the latter the pronouns alone retain the inflexion. The possessive expresses only one relation, and the objective can hardly express more than one without leaning on a preposition. Sanskrit has the accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, and ablative. The Greek language retains traces, in the locative adverbs, of an almost equal number of cases, and each of the three remaining cases expresses a variety of relations, which in the earlier literature were more vividly conceived than in the more conventional usage of later times. It would be instructive to study the gradations of the change from Homer downwards, through the earlier and later Attic, the common dialect and the Byzantine period, to modern Greek. The dying vigour of the old forms would be seen to revive and grow again from time to time. <emph>Experiments</emph> more or less conscious sprang up and withered, before the prevailing habit was finally determined. Opposite tendencies are seen working together: the preposition being sometimes inserted as well as sometimes omitted unexpectedly. In this process, as in every important modification of language, the poetic instinct plays an active part. More conscious than other men of implicit meanings and connections of words, the poet gives new life to the decaying forms. All poetry abounds with novel modes of speech, from which common language selects what is most in accordance with prevailing tendencies and most suitable for use. That the case-endings still retained much of their force in the old Attic is evident from the language of Thucydides. The poet seizes this instrument of condensed expression and strives to multiply it, partly by reverting to earlier modes, but chiefly through analogical and metaphorical applications. The exact intention in each instance is not always easily determined. It was no doubt felt but could not have been explained by a contemporary Greek.
</p>

<p>
 Even in English, where the limits of the experiment are so narrow, there have been similar attempts to extend the use of the cases. Thus the remote object is often expressed without a preposition by a second objective case which thus performs the function of a dative, and there are many instances in the Elizabethan poets of a sort of dativus ethicus. E. g. <quote>A' would manage you his piece thus,</quote> <quote>A good sherris-sack ascends me into the brain,</quote> etc.
</p>
 <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>
 The question as to the origin of inflexions has little direct bearing on the present subject. Although the theory that derives the cases <pb n="10"/>  from relations of place is most in accordance with the analogy of language-which seems to proceed, like the other phenomena of thought, from without inwards, and is probably true, yet this account of the cases, in the later state of language which is alone known to us, affords hardly any help in determining the multifarious and anomalous relations which in the course of ages have grown up around them. And could it be shown that the function of each case was in the beginning simple and definite, and not rather tentative and vague, yet they have not reached the position in which we first find them without many cross-influences which are hard to investigate. Reflections from other relations, the exigencies of growing expression, and the re-action of different uses upon each other, have woven a sort of tangle, in which the eye can hardly follow any branch to its origin. Hence, while the distinction between external and internal relations may afford a principle of classification, which accords in some degree with changes actually observed, this is not to be supposed equivalent to the distinction between earlier and later modes in the period under discussion. There are further differences which it may be useful to bear in mind. In attempting to analyse the uses which are actually found, it is important to recognize the difference between the metaphysical analogy which has suggested certain constructions, and the rule of usage to which they tend to conform, and, thirdly, the generalization of them which is made by the grammarian. And it may be observed, in passing from this part of the subject, that many things are determined by use, quite regularly, of which no metaphysical explanation can be given, and which can hardly be reduced to a general principle.

THE GENITIVE.
</head>
  <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>
  The genitive has two main significations, which are clearly distinguished, although in some instances they pass into each other, the ablative and the attributive. The former is gradually discarded, except with prepositions, and the case more and more assumes the character, to which it has been thought to owe the name γενική πτῶσις, denoting the kind to which a thing belongs, and thus tending always to express the wider of two conceptions. The connection between the governing noun, and the noun in the genitive by which it is included or determined, is sometimes so indefinite as to be extremely difficult to analyse. Common uses of the genitive are-

<p>
 The accusative in apposition to the action, i. e. governed not by the particular verb, but by the general verbal notion, which it is intended further to define, is also common in Greek, especially in poetry. There are two chief cases of this idiom, corresponding severally to a participial clause (ταῦτα ποιῶν) and to an infinitive with ὥστε (ὥστε ταῦτα ποιεῖν).] In Sophocles this use helps concentration, e. g.

But φύσιν being postponed, and the construction thus partially obscured, the sentence is continued as if the accusative had followed an active verb (e. g. ἔχουσα). In
<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 760">Aj. 760.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνθρώπου φύσιν βλαστών,</quote> the construction appears to be similarly modified from ἄνθρωπος φύσιν βλ., in which φύσιν would be the accusative of limitation. The case of φύσιν here may therefore be explained either as the accusative of limitation or as the cognate accusative.

PREPOSITIONS.
</head>

<p>
   The origin of the Preposition is later and less obscure than that of the cases; and was certainly connected with notions of place. In ἀντί, for instance, the process can still be traced from the locative case of a noun (cp. the French en face) of which the accusative appears in Homer, as in the phrase εἰς ἄντα, first to an adverb of place= ἄντην, and then to the prepositional use, which in the signification <gloss>instead of,</gloss> passes out of the association of place.
</p>

<p>
 As life and thought grew more complex, the variety even of local relations became greater than could be clearly expressed by the case-endings. Hence the preposition became more and more essential as a part of speech: the analytical mode of expression taking the place of the organic, or synthetical, by a process similar to that observable in the introduction of other auxiliary words, as in the σχῆμα Χαλκιδικὸν (ἐστὶν ἔχον, etc.) and the modern Greek substitute for the infinitive mood.

 The use of the plural for the singular is a common feature of the tragic dialect. There is a tendency in poetry to the use of abstract words, which are expressive of feeling, as may be often observed in the substitution of the abstract for the concrete. In like manner the vagueness of the plural is frequently the expression of poetical feeling, as in the following instances:-

ARTICLE AND PRONOUN.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α" n="α">

<p>
 As the Article is sprung from the demonstrative pronoun, and the relative pronoun has the same origin, it is right to consider them together, and the earliest grammarians understood this when they included them under one name as ἄρθρα.
</p>

<p>
 It has been sometimes imagined, in accordance with a tradition of Aristarchus, that the article is always pronominal in Homer, and always, with certain fixed exceptions, merely attributive in later Greek. But the change was gradual, and can partly be traced. There are beginnings of the weaker or simply defining use, even in Homer :-
</p>

<p>
 <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.167">Il. 1.167.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον</quote>—<gloss>Far greater is that gift which falls to thee.</gloss> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.325">Il. 23.325.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ᾽ ἔχει ἀσφαλέως καὶ τὸν προὔχοντα δοκεύει</quote>-<gloss>But holds securely, and watches him the foremost.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
<pb n="32"/>  In these and other such instances, the use is no doubt more vivid than in later Greek; that is to say, an individual image is presented to the mind: but we perceive in them the transition to the usage which afterwards became fixed. On the other hand, there are remains of the pronominal use even in the later Attic (καὶ ὅς, ἢ δ᾽ ὅς, ἡ δ᾽ ἤ, ὁ μέν, ὁ δέ, πρὸ τοῦ, τοῦ ὁ ἔστιν, τῶν ὅσα, τὰ καὶ τά, τὸ δ᾽ ἦν ἄρα, ἐν τοῖς πρῶτος, κ.τ.λ.). <bibl n="Plat. Laws 701E">Plat. Legg. iii. 701 E.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὔτε τοῖς, οὔτε τοῖς.</quote> <bibl n="Plat. Laws 721B">Plat. Legg. iv. 721 B.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τῇ καὶ τῇ δὲ ἀτιμίᾳ.</quote>
</p>

<p>
From the early Epic to the late Attic usage, there is a gradation, in which Sophocles comes about half-way. While he employs the article more largely as a pronoun than could have been done at a later time, he is more sparing in the attributive or defining use, which thus retains more graphic power than in ordinary language.

</p>

<p>
Ὁ δé, indefinite, occurs without ὁ μέν preceding.

</p>

<p>
 But the demonstrative use occurs also in a different connexion.
<bibl n="Soph. OC 1699">O. C. 1699 lyr.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁπότε γε καὶ τὸν ἐν χεροῖν κατεῖχον</quote>-<gloss>What time I kept him too in my embrace.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.3" n="3">

<p>
 The article as a demonstrative is used adverbially, by a continuance of the Homeric idiom, without the help of a particle.
<bibl n="Soph. OT 510">O. T. 510 lyr.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τῷ ἀπ᾿ ἐμᾶς φρενός -</quote> <gloss>Therefore,</gloss> etc.

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.4" n="4">

<p>
 The relative use of the article in tragic Greek is confined to the cases which have at the commencement (probably to avoid the confusion of ὁ and ὅ, ἡ and ἥ); and occurs in these, as a rule, only where the is required to prevent hiatus. Exceptions are-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 35">O. C. 35.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">σκοπὸς προσήκεις τῶν ἀδηλοῦμεν φράσαι (</quote>where the <pb n="33"/>  reading is questionable) - <gloss>Thou art come as an informant of the things whereof we doubt, to tell us of them.</gloss>

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.5" n="5">

<p>
 The transition to the common use appears in such expressions as-
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 371">Phil. 371.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁ δ᾽ εἶπ᾿ Ὀδυσσεύς, πλησίον γὰρ ἂν κύρει</quote>-<gloss>And he said, Odysseus said, for he chanced to be standing near;</gloss> where the noun is in apposition to the article, which still retains its pronominal force.

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6" n="6">

<p>
 To pass now to the attributive or defining use of the article :- The defining article retains a greater liveliness, i. e. more vestiges of the earlier demonstrative use, than in later Greek, and even than in contemporary prose; and the limits of the usage are less fixed. Hence—.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6.a" n="a">

<p>
The article sometimes receives a strong emphasis. Especially remarkable in this connexion is
<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 409">Ant. 409</bibl>, <quote xml:lang="grc">where the article is placed at the end of an Iambic line- πᾶσαν κόνιν σήραντες ἡ κατεῖχε τὸν | νέκυν</quote>-<gloss>Having wiped off all the dust which covered that corse.</gloss> Cp.

</p>

<p>
 Less marked but still emphatic are- О. Т. 864. lyг. τὰν εὔσεπτον ἁγνείαν λόγων-<gloss>The grace of pious purity in words,</gloss> etc.
<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1050">Ib. 1050.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁ καιρὸς εὑρῆσθαι τάδε</quote>-<gloss>It is full time that this discovery be made.</gloss>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6.b" n="b">

<p>
 The article is omitted-
</p>

<p>
 (1) With one of two co-ordinate words, though added to the other.

In proof of this, it may be observed that Ionic Greek has τοῦ and τέῳ, τευ and τεῳ, in the interrogative and indefinite meaning, but never as cases of the article.

</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.β.1" n="1">

<p>
 The demonstratives, especially ὅδε, are often so used that the antecedent or correlative has to be gathered from the context.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. El. 963">El. 963.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ τῶνδε μέντοι,</quote> where the antecedent to τῶνδε has to be inferred from the adverbs ἄλεκτρα . . ἀνυμέναιά τε.
</p>

<p>
 Thus ὅδε frequently refers not to something present but to something which has just been mentioned or suggested.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 17">Tr. 17.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">πρὶν τῆσδε κοίτης ἐμπελασθῆναι</quote>-i. e. the marriage with Achelous.
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 716-18">Ib. 716-18.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τοῦδε ὅδε .. τόνδε</quote>-Nessus Hercules, neither of whom is present.
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 132">Phil. 132.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">σοὶ παρεὶς τάδε.</quote>

<bibl n="Soph. OT 242">O. T. 242</bibl>, 801, 948, 1157, Tг. 933, 935.
</p>

<p>
 So the adverb τῇδε
<bibl n="Soph. OC 641">O. C. 641.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τῇδε γὰρ ξυνοίσομαι.</quote>
<bibl n="Soph. El. 1302">El. 1302.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ τοὐμὸν ἔσται τῇδ᾽.</quote>
</p>

<p>
 On the other hand, ὅδε is used with pointed emphasis not only for the first personal pronoun (
<bibl n="Soph. OC 450">O. C. 450</bibl>, etc.), but as an indirect expression for the possessive pronoun of different persons. (Cp. These hands shall tear her, Shak. Much Ado, iv. 1).
<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 449">Ant. 449.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τούσδ' ὑπερβαίνειν νόμους-</quote> <gloss>To transgress our edict.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
 And with a certain pathos in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 822">Phil. 822.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">κάρα γὰρ ὑπτιάζεται τόδε</quote>-<gloss>For, see, his head falls backwards.</gloss>

<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 163">Phil. 163.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">στίβον ὀγμεύει τόνδε.</quote> <pb n="35"/>  οὗτος occurs similarly without a distinct correlative.

Cp. Shak. H. VIII. i. 1. <gloss>Must fetch him in he papers,</gloss> where there is a similar ambiguity in the two pronouns.
</p>

<p>
So τοιοῦτος.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 1049">Phil. 1049.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰρ τοιούτων δεῖ, τοιοῦτός εἰμ᾿ ἐγώ –</quote> <gloss>Where such are needed, such am I.</gloss>

<p>
 The familiar distinction between ὅδε and οὗτος is not always preserved. They are sometimes used alternately with the same reference, for variety and to suit the verse.

THE ADJECTIVE
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
<p>
  With respect to the Adjective, as well as to the case-endings, the feeling of analogy was stronger in the age of Sophocles, and the force of convention weaker, than at a later time; and he is able to extend adjectival uses, from the same instinctive consciousness of the meaning of inflexions to which the extension of the case-idioms is also due. And speaking generally, the adjective is used by him (as by earlier writers) with greater freedom than in ordinary Attic Greek.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.5.α" n="α">

<p>
One obvious peculiarity which he shares with the other Tragic poets is the tendency to redouble epithets, often without any connecting particle; e. g.
</p>

<p>
 The rule that the article or other determinative word should immediately precede an adjective when used attributively is apparently broken, by an epithet being introduced after a noun to which (1) the article or (2) an interjection has been attached. The adjective in this case may be regarded as placed in apposition to the noun, and as conveying an implied predication. It will be observed that in several instances there is a possessive pronoun preceding the noun.

THE ADVERB.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α" n="α">

<p>
The Adverb, like the preposition, to which it is allied (see above, p. 26, § 18), is sometimes made to bear an unusual emphasis or stress of meaning; e. g.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OT 608">O. T. 608.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">γνώμῃ δ᾽ ἀδήλῳ μή με χωρὶς αἰτιῶ</quote>-<gloss>But do not on a vague surmise accuse me apart,</gloss> i. e. without the proofs indicated above.

<bibl n="Soph. OC 428">O. C. 428.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὕτως ἀτίμως πατρίδος ἐξωθούμενον-</quote> <gloss>So dishonoured with banishment.</gloss>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α.1" n="1">

<p>
 By this means the adverb is brought into relation with the whole clause rather than with any particular word.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OT 675">O. T. 675.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">αὑταῖς δικαίως εἰσὶν ἄλγισται φέρειν</quote> <gloss>With justice are hardest to themselves to bear.</gloss>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α.2" n="2">

<p>

Uses of μή.
</head>

<p>
  μή, originally the prohibitive particle, is adapted in Greek, through various uses, to express purpose, hypothesis, general or abstract notions, and also negations that are viewed not merely as facts, but as determinations of volition, feeling, or thought. Extensions of the use of μή in Sophocles arise partly from his love of refining on language; and partly from the tendency to more abstract modes of expression. A few points are deserving of special notice.

<p>
The tendency to make an implied negative explicit is a common feature of Greek syntax. Negative expressions are apt to be unduly emphasized in consequence of some latent consciousness that their significance is imperfectly realized. [<bibl n="Hdt. 7.54">Hdt. vii. 54.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἔχω διακρῖναι, οὔτε εἰ . . οὔτε εἰ, κ.τ.λ.]</quote>

 Another form of this phenomenon is the use of μὴ οὐ with infinitives and participles.

<p>
  The pleonastic oὐ in this and similar idioms (οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ, <bibl n="Hdt. 4.118">Hdt. iv. 118</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 5.94">Hdt. v. 94</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 7.16">Hdt. vii. 16</bibl> § 3, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.62">Thuc. ii. 62</bibl>: πρὶν δ᾽ οὐδὲν ὀρθῶς εἰδέναι, τί κ.τ.λ.
<bibl n="Eur. Hel. 322">Eur. Hel. 322</bibl>) is caused by the difficulty of holding two negatives at once (or a negative with an interrogative or comparative) distinctly before the mind.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.7.η.3.a" n="a">

<p>
 Where a negative or privative notion has been negatived, and is further explained, μὴ οὐ is used with an epexegetic infinitive or participle; especially when the chief negation refers to circumstances actually present. [<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 354B">Plat. Rep. i. 354 B.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἀπεσχόμην τὸ μὴ οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἐλθεῖν.]</quote>

<p>
A special case of the last mentioned idiom (μὴ οὐ giving a negative condition of a negative statement) occurs, where a supposed course of action is deprecated, or marked as blameworthy. In this connexion the infinitive is more frequent, but the participle is also used. [Plato, Prot. 352 D. αἰσχρόν ἐστι καὶ ἐμοὶ ... μὴ οὐχὶ ... φάναι. Ι.e. αἰσχρὸν ἂν εἴη, εἰ μὴ φαίην.]

This might have been expressed according to the Platonic idiom: δυσαλγήτου ἀνδρός ἐστι τὸ μὴ οὐ κατοικτείρειν τοιάνδε ἔδραν.
</p>

<p>
  Here, as in the examples under a, the circumstances of the negation (δυσάλγητος=οὐκ εὐτρεπὴς πρὸς τὸ ἀλγῆσαι) are present and actual (τοιάνδε ἔδραν); but in

 With respect to interrogative particles it is enough to mention that the long apa is sometimes equivalent to ἆρ' οὐ, or rather expresses a stronger certainty. This may be explained by supposing an ironical or indignant suppression of the negative, as unnecessary in so clear a case.

</p>

VOICES. The tendency to subtle and indirect forms of expression leads to several exceptional uses of the active, middle, and passive voices.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1" n="1">

<head>
ACTIVE VOICE.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1.a" n="a">

<p>
 There is a peculiar use of the active participle neuter, which occurs in Sophocles and some contemporary writers, though not at all in earlier, and rarely in later Greek.
</p>

<p>
  A state of the person, generally mental, is expressed by the neuter participle with the article, which thus becomes a sort of subject; e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.36">Thuc. i. 36.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὲν δεδιὸς αὐτοῦ :</quote> <bibl n="Thuc. 3.9">Thuc. iii. 9.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐν γὰρ τῷ διαλλάσσοντι τῆς γνώμης καὶ αἱ διαφοραὶ τῶν ἔργων καθίστανται :</quote> <bibl n="Thuc. 5.9">Thuc. v. 9.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τοῦ μένοντος (</quote><gloss>the determination to stand firm</gloss>) : <bibl n="Thuc. 6.24">Thuc. vi. 24.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦν τοῦ πλοῦ :</quote> <bibl n="Thuc. 7.68">Thuc. vii. 68.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀποπλῆσαι τῆς γνώμης τὸ θυμούμενον.</quote>
</p>

<p>
  This idiom arises partly from the difficulty of finding expressions for mental phenomena, and partly from the tendency to express feelings as states of emotion, and hence to employ the verb rather than the noun. The only continuance of this use in later Greek is in such philosophical terms as τὸ αἰσθανόμενον, τὸ ὀρεγόμενον, τὸ νοοῦν, τὸ ἡγούμενον, τὸ προαιρούμενον, τὸ συνειδός.
</p>

<p>
  The Sophoclean examples are-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 1219">O. C. 1219</bibl> lyr. ὅταν τις ἐς πλέον πέσῃ τοῦ θέλοντος-see note in loco.
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 674-675">Phil. 674-675.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ γὰρ | νοσοῦν ποθεῖ σε συμπαραστάτην λαβεῖν</quote> <gloss>For my diseased state longs to obtain thee as a supporter.</gloss>
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 196">Tr. 196.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ γὰρ ποθοῦν ἕκαστος ἐκμαθεῖν θέλων -</quote> <gloss>For each wishing to feed with information his particular craving;</gloss> τὸ ποθοῦν, that which is <gloss>beating in the mind.</gloss> (Shak. Temp. i. 2.) In this last example the feeling and its object are identified.
</p>

<p>
  In the following instances the action is similarly identified with the agent or subject, although a state is not described.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 266-267">O. C. 266-267.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ τὰ γ᾽ ἔργα μου | πεπονθότ᾽ ἐστὶ μᾶλλον ἢ δεδρακότα</quote> <gloss>Since for my actions, they have more in them of suffering than of doing.</gloss>
<bibl n="Soph. OC 1604-1605">Ib. 1604-1605.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ δὲ παντὸς εἶχε δρῶντος ἡδονὴν | κοὐκ ἦν ἔτ᾽ οὐδὲν ἀργὸν ὧν ἐφίετο</quote>-<gloss>And when he had satisfaction in seeing everything in act, and no part of his commands was any longer idle.</gloss> (Cp.
<bibl n="Aesch. PB 57">Aesch. Prom. 57.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ ματᾷ τοὔργον τόδε.)</quote>

</p>

<p>
It is noticeable that five of the six instances (which are all that occur) belong to the latest period of Sophocles, which is most nearly contemporary with the work of Thucydides.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1.b" n="b">

<p>
 The absolute or otherwise intransitive use of active verbs will be considered as a point of diction (in Part II). But the following rare actives deserve notice here :-ἄζονθ' (
<bibl n="Soph. OC 134">O. C. 134</bibl>), μηχανᾶν (
<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 1037">Aj. 1037</bibl>), ὁρίζει (

<bibl n="Soph. OC 255">Ib. 255</bibl>), εἴρυσον (
<bibl n="Soph. OC 1033">Ib. 1033</bibl>). See notes in ll. In each of these cases the active voice, marking the absoluteness of the action, is more dignified than the middle would have been. <pb n="52"/>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1.c" n="c">

<p>
 Sometimes by a vivid turn of construction the active mode of expression is introduced, where the passive would have been more natural.

  In each instance poetical liveliness is enhanced by an inanimate cause being made the subject of an active verb.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1.d" n="d">

<p>
 In all Greek, especially in poetry, there is a tendency to express actively states and conditions which are really passive, as in the familiar φύειν τρίχας, etc. Hence αἴρειν and other active verbs are used of passive states.

The Subjective Middle.
</head>

<p>
  This use of the middle voice is of much wider extent in Greek from Homer to Plato than has been commonly supposed. It may be familiarly explained as equivalent to the active voice with the genitive of the reflexive pronoun. I. e. if the directly reflexive middle=ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτόν, and the indirectly reflexive = ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτῷ, then the subjective middle voice=ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτοῦ, ἐκ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ, οἱ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ.

PASSIVE VOICE.

<p>
   Sophocles shows a singular fondness for the Passive Voice.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.a" n="a">

<p>
As the active gives additional liveliness, the passive is convenient where there is reason to prefer an impersonal mode of expression.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.b" n="b">

The passive has also the effect of giving a stronger emphasis to the verb :-

  Or to the object of the action, by making this the subject of the passive form. [<bibl n="Hdt. 4.105">Hdt. iv. 105.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">λέγονται . . . ὑπὸ Σκυθέων . . ὡς ... ἕκαστος λύκος γίγνεται.]</quote>

<p>
The present (or imperf.) and aorist are sometimes combined to mark the relation of a momentary to a continuous action.

 There is a tense in English which has no distinct equivalent in Greek, viz. <gloss>I have been doing</gloss> so and so. This is expressed commonly by the imperfect, or by the present, where the action still continues.

<p>
The use of the aorist in tragic Greek to point emphatically to something in the immediate past, where the present would be used in most languages, is well known. The momentariness of the tense favours this mode of speaking.
</p>

<p>
An extension of this use occurs where something present is made the subject of inquiry or reflection. Here the principle seems to be that what is thought of must have a previous existence; the object must exist before it can be thought. (Compare the use of ἦν in such philosophical expressions as τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι.)

ΕΡΕΧEGESIS
</head>

<p>
 Epexegesis is frequent in classical Greek, arising partly from a fusile condition of language, in which the thought still moves, while it is being expressed, and also from a tendency to redundance, by which symmetry is often sacrificed to fulness and clearness. The act of expression tends to suggest some new aspect or point of view, which makes a sort of excrescence on the original construction, in the shape of an explanatory clause.
</p>

ATTRACTION
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>
  Attraction is the grammatical name for a very general tendency in Greek to draw words into apparent construction with the nearest word. In constructions πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον the meaning takes the place of grammatical analogy; in Attraction the meaning and the grammatical analogy both give way to mere contiguity. A new analogy is thus created, and is sanctioned by use.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.a" n="a">

<p>
 The simplest mode of attraction is where the relative assumes the case of the antecedent.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. El. 177">El. 177 lyr.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">μήθ' οἷς ἐχθαίρεις | ὑπεράχθεο.</quote>
</p>

<p>
This happens even where the case of the relative without the attraction would be other than the accusative, as in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 546">Ant. 546.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἃ μὴ ᾿θιγες ποιοῦ σεαυτῆς; ⅰ. Ε. ταῦτα, ὧν μὴ ᾿θίγες.</quote>
</p>

<p>
So with the relative adverb.
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 701">Tr. 701.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐκ δὲ γῆς, ὅθεν | προὔκειτ' (= οὗ προὔκειτο).</quote>
</p>

<p>
  Where the antecedent is omitted, the preposition is sometimes added to the case.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 334">O. C. 334.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ξὺν ᾧπερ εἶχον=ξὺν τούτῳ, ὅνπερ εἶχον.</quote>
<bibl n="Soph. OC 625">Ib. 625.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐν οἶσιν ἠρξάμην= ἐν τούτοις, οἷς ἠρξάμην.</quote>
</p>

<p>
The converse is also frequent, where the antecedent is assimilated to the relative, or taken into the dependent clause.
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 283">Tr. 283.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τάσδε δ᾽ ἅσπερ εἰσορᾷς.</quote>
<bibl n="Soph. OC 1150">O. C. 1150.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">λόγος δ' ὃς ἐμπέπτωκεν ἀρτίως ἐμοὶ .. συμβαλοῦ γνώμην</quote>—<gloss>But give us your thought on a matter that has just fallen in my way.</gloss>
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 225">Tr. 225.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐδέ μ' ὄμματος | *φρουρὰν παρῆλθε, τόνδε μὴ λεύσσειν στόλον</quote>-<gloss>Nor hath it passed my eye's strict watch, that I should fail to see this band.</gloss> Sc. ὅδε ὁ στόλος παρῆλθεν, (ὥστε) μὴ λεύσσειν αὐτόν. <pb n="60"/>
</p>

<p>
 A marked example of this inverse attraction occurs in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 1227">O. C. 1227 lyr.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">βῆναι κεῖθεν ὅθεν περ ἥκει,</quote> i. e. κεῖσε, ὅθεν.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.b" n="b">

<p>
 The subject of an infinitive is often drawn into agreement with a preceding dative.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 92">Tr. 92.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ γὰρ ὑστέρῳ τό γ' εὖ | πράσσειν.</quote>
</p>

<p>
An extension of this analogy to the genitive probably accounts for the construction of the participle in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 1140-2">Phil. 1140-2.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρός τοι τὸ μὲν εὖ δίκαιον εἰπεῖν· | εἰπόντος δὲ μὴ φθονερὰν | ἐξῶσαι γλώσσας ὀδύναν</quote>-<gloss>To give full utterance to (τὸ εὐ εἰπεῖν) a just sentiment (δίκαιον) becomes a man, but not in uttering it to thrust forth venom from an envious tongue.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.c" n="c">

<p>
 Attraction sometimes occurs in hypothetical and other coordinate clauses besides the relative.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 488">Aj. 488.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">εἴπερ τινὸς σθένοντος-</quote> <gloss>Strong if any were so.</gloss>

<bibl n="Soph. El. 317">El. 317.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τοῦ κασιγνήτου τί φής; ἥξοντος, ἢ μέλλοντος;</quote> i. e. ἥξοντα ἢ μέλλοντα.
<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 1415">Aj. 1415.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τῷ πάντ' ἀγαθῷ, | κοὐδενί πω λῴονι θνατῶν</quote> <gloss>To him who was good every way, no one of mortals better.</gloss>

<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 683">Tr. 683.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">χαλκῆς ὅπως δύσνιπτον ἐκ δέλτου γραφήν</quote>—<gloss>Like writing on a brazen tablet, hard to erase:</gloss> (χαλκῇ ἐν δέλτῳ γραφήν was the first thought, but has been drawn into construction with δύσνιπτον.)
</p>

<p>
It is part of the same tendency when, as often happens in similes, the thing compared is expressed in terms suggested by the comparison; e. g.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 31-3">Tr. 31-3.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὓς κεῖνός ποτε, | γήτης ὅπως ἄρουραν ἔκτοπον λαβών, | σπείρων μόνον προσεῖδε κάξαμῶν ἅπαξ.</quote>
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 537-538">Ib. 537-538.</bibl>
</p>

<p>
The principle of attraction might be extended so as to embrace all cases in which constructions are determined, not by strict logical or grammatical considerations, but by superficial associations (hypallage, etc.). Thus in
<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 114">Aj. 114.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τέρψις ἥδε σοι τὸ δρᾶν, ἥδε</quote> should have been ὧδε, but is <term>attracted</term> to the nearest word. In
<bibl n="Soph. OT 1376">O. T. 1376.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">(τέκνων ὄψις) βλαστοῦσα = βλαστόντων.</quote> And in
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 630">Phil. 630.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">δεῖξαι νεὼς ἄγοντα,</quote> the more exact construction would have been vηΐ depending on ἄγοντα, but δεῖξαι having come first, νεώς= ἐκ νεώς (supr. p. 10) in construction with δεῖξαι is preferred, i. e. δείξαι ἐκ νεὼς ἄγοντα ἐπὶ νηΐ. So an answer often follows the structure of the preceding speech though another construction would be more logical. Instances of this will be pointed out in the notes.

MOODS OF VERBS

Uses of the Indicative.
</head>

<p>
 By the analogy of the well-known use of the past tenses of the indicative with ἵνα, ὡς, ὅπως to express a purpose, which is either <pb n="61"/>  in its nature impossible or contrary to fact, the same tenses appear, in two cases, to be employed in expressing with μή a negative wish applied to past time.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 539-41">O. C. 539-41.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐδεξάμην | δῶρον, ὁ μήποτ᾽ ἐγὼ ταλακάρδιος | ἐπωφέλησα πόλεος ἐξελέσθαι</quote>-<gloss>A gift, which would that hapless I had not benefited the city so as to receive from her.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
  Here the place of the relative conjunction ὡς or ὅπως is supplied by the relative ὅ, and the unusual construction is perhaps assisted by an echo or <term>harmonic</term> from ἐπωφέλησα suggesting ὤφελον.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 1713">O.

In both places μή is very emphatic. (Cp.

DOUBLE AND FEEBLE CONSTRUCTIONS
</head>

<p>
  In the analysis of a Greek sentence, it is often difficult to determine with which of two words or clauses some word or clause is to be joined, and the true solution sometimes is that it has a connection with both, being joined with one in a primary, and with the other in a secondary construction. This is a general phenomenon, the observation of which is especially important in the more minute study of Sophocles. The poet or speaker has two constructions or rather analogies in his mind, and instead of deciding upon one or other of them, as would be done by a writer of a grammatical age, he fuses both together or allows the expression to shift from one to the other. The well-known οἶσθ᾽ ὡς ποίησον; (
<bibl n="Soph. OT 543">O. T. 543</bibl>), (a conversational idiom not confined to Sophocles), οἶσθ᾽ ὡς . . μὴ σφαλῇς; (
<bibl n="Soph. OC 75">O. C. 75</bibl>), are phrases obviously requiring some such explanation, viz. as a confusion of ποίησον and οἶσθ' ὡς ποιήσεις, etc. The tendency is one which prevails widely in the Greek of this period, and has a proportionate effect on the subtle language of Sophocles.

PARATAXIS
</head>

<p>
  While the subordination of sentences becomes more exact and complex, there remains, in Greek of all periods, a form of sentence, in which a notion essentially subordinate is coordinated with the main predication. A familiar example occurs in the New Testament, where the idiom is retained in the English Authorised Version: <gloss>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</gloss> Rom. vi. 17; cp. Matt. xi. 25. A parallel instance may also be quoted from Shak., Jul. Caes. i. 3: <quote>Let it be who it is, for Romans now | Have thews and sinews like their ancestors; | But, woe the while, our fathers' minds are dead.</quote> Cp. esp. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.182">Il. 1.182</bibl> ff. ὡς ἔμ᾽ ἀφαιρεῖται Χρυσηίδα Φοίβος Ἀπόλλων, τὴν μὲν . . πέμψω, ἐγὼ δέ κ᾿ ἄγω Βρισηίδα, κ.τ.λ. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 367E">Plat.

  Hence also the specially Greek figure of Oxymoron. Some wrongness or other strangeness is expressed through a contradiction in terms, in which qualities seemingly opposite are combined. (<bibl n="Hdt. 3.147">Hdt. iii. 147.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">μεμνημένος ἐπελανθάνετο.)</quote>

 Even further removed from the simple oxymoron, but still hingeing on the same principle of verbal contrast, are a kind of paradoxical expressions, in which a contradiction is hinted but not prominently brought out. These may be termed quasioxymora, and are often equivalent to a mere negative.

PROLEPSIS
</head>

<p>
   The concentrating effort of poetry, and especially of tragic poetry, leads to anticipatory forms of expression, called proleptic by the grammarians, in which things successive are treated as simultaneous, effects are viewed as concomitants, and results as attributes. Hence an adjective has sometimes in grammar the place of an epithet, which, in meaning, is really part of the predicate. Sophocles frequently has recourse to this means of presenting in a single moment what would seem more languid if expanded in the order of time.
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. OC 1200">O. C. 1200.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τῶν σῶν ἀδέρκτων ὀμμάτων τητώμενος.</quote>
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 106">Tr. 106.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">οὔ</quote>- ποτ᾿ εὐνάζειν ἀδακρύτων βλεφάρων πόθον.

<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 543">Aj. 543.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔρποντι φωνεῖς ἡ λελειμμένῳ λόγων;</quote>
</p>

<p>
  Such examples are to be carefully distinguished from the common supplementary predicate expressing result, as in-
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 394">Phil. 394 lyr.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">Πακτωλὸν εὔχρυσον νέμεις</quote>-<gloss>Who makest Pactolus to be rich in gold,</gloss> (but see above, pp. 38, 9).

</p>

<p>
  These expressions are already proleptic, but, in the previous instances the prolepsis is carried a step further by the adjective being made an epithet or attribute.
</p>

<p>
  In
<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 647">Aj. 647.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">φύει τ' ἄδηλα,</quote> we have an instance of the contrary process of the antecedent being treated as a concomitant. b.

ELLIPSE AND PLEONASM
</head>

<p>
 The remark which has been made with reference to the cases and prepositions (pp. 9, 27) may be applied more generally, viz. that the defect and redundancy in the language of this period arise from the same cause, the vivid realization of the elements of language combined with the incipient growth of reflection.
</p>

<p>
  The poetical impulse has also the two elements of condensation and fulness.
</p>

PLEONASM
</head>

<p>
  Redundancy is natural to a language that is beginning to reflect upon itself. What was at first implicit seeks to become explicit, and finds reduplicated expression. The consciousness of imperfect utterance gives rise to supplementary words and phrases, not contemplated in the first formation of the sentence, which is expanded as it moves along (see above, pp. 27, 1; 37, a; 46, e); and the same analytical tendency which occasions the use of the auxiliary verb (see above, p. 56, 8) gives rise to many other periphrases, such as ἔθεσθ' ἐπιστροφήν (
<bibl n="Soph. OT 134">O. T. 134</bibl>), ποδοῖν ἄρθρα (ib. 1032, πίστιν φέρειν, etc.). Other forms of pleonasm are:-
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="C.3.β.1" n="1">

<head>
Redundancy of the negative.
</head>

<p>
This has been already noticed (p. 48, 1, 49). One or two instances may be again given :-

The antecedent, though sufficiently indicated in the correlative clause, is sometimes further expressed by a pronoun, for the sake of clearness and point. (This is frequent in Plato, e. g. Theaet. 162, E. ἃ οἱ πολλοὶ ἂν ἀποδέχοιντο ἀκούοντες, λέγετε ταῦτα.)

ORDER OF WORDS AND EMPHASIS
</head>

<p>
   In language not yet reduced to grammatical precision, the interpreter should attend closely to the order of the words.
</p>

<p>
(1) The arrangement of the sentence corresponds more nearly than afterwards to the order in which the thoughts are suggested to the mind of the writer.
</p>

<p>
(2) There is more freedom used in the juxta-position of words for the sake of contrast or comparison or other association: because, the distinction of clauses being still incomplete, a parenthesis or subordinate clause (participial or otherwise) can be more easily interwoven with the principal clause, by the words of each being placed alternately. This has often the effect of producing a more equable or balanced rhythm; just as when in a single clause the words in agreement are separated. (
<bibl n="Soph. OT 109">O. T. 109.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἴχνος παλαιᾶς δυστέκμαρτον αἰτίας.</quote>
<bibl n="Soph. OT 1245">Ib. 1245.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἤδη Λάϊον πάλαι νεκρόν.</quote>

</p>

<p>
(3) The exigencies, or, to speak more accurately, the proprieties of metre must be considered. Thus, the most emphatic position in an iambic line is in the first foot, which has the chief arsis: and, generally, the more emphatic word is placed first, although negatives and interrogatives, whose natural place is in the beginning of a sentence, are sometimes made more emphatic through being postponed.
</p>

<p>
(4) In judging of constructions in Sophocles, and also in determining the text, great weight must be given to the preservation of rhythm and also of a natural emphasis. That a reading has the effect of producing a strained or misplaced emphasis, or of weakening the chief emphasis by the addition of a too emphatic word, is an objection (whether to a reading or interpretation) of the most <pb n="77"/>   fatal kind. The language of Sophocles is seldom quite regular, but is always harmonious.

The following examples are intended to illustrate :-(α) The alternation of clauses. (β) The prominence of the emphatic word. (γ) The postponement of the interrogative or negative for the sake of emphasis. (δ) Separation of an emphatic word. (ε) Imperfect or borrowed emphasis.

 In a few instances a word has an imperfect or borrowed emphasis, i. e. is placed in an emphatic position by reason of an inexact antithesis, or because of the stress laid upon some other word. This, like many other irregularities, may be accounted for by the principle of attraction. See above, p. 60. A familiar <pb n="79"/>   proof of the same tendency in earlier Greek is the repetition of the personal pronoun in antitheses. (<bibl n="Hom.

  This arises partly from the love of antithesis, and partly from comparison and reflection. The mind in dwelling on a fact or supposition, reverts to what is opposite or correlative, and is thus led to refine upon the direct and natural mode of expression.

CONDENSED EXPRESSION

<p>
   It has been already noticed (p. 39) that the attempt is sometimes made to condense a whole phrase into an adjective, and also (p. 74, 8) that Sophocles occasionally uses abbreviations, for which there may have been precedent in the idiom of conversation. It may now be stated more generally that the love of concentration often leads him to hint in a single phrase what could only be made explicit in a complicated sentence. This happens most frequently in the choral odes, where the vivid play of association supersedes conventional uses.

 Repetition after an interval.
</p>

<p>
  One point in which modern languages are more precise and exacting than the ancient is their sensitiveness in not allowing the same  <pb n="84"/>   word to be used twice, unless for special reasons, in the same passage. This requirement runs counter to a natural proclivity, as all must be aware who have had occasion to correct a hastily written letter. The word that has most recently passed through the mind is most likely to present itself for selection, though it is rejected by the instinct of a modern writer. But in Sophocles this tendency appears unchecked, and, whether from the vividness of the impression which accompanied each word, or from whatever cause, seems to have been unusually strong. A word once used is apt to be repeated in a different connection and even with a different meaning.

<p>
  The above examples, however, do not all belong to one and the same class. In the lyrical measures, a phrase of the strophe is often echoed in the antistrophe, which, according to a probable theory, may have been chanted by a different part of the chorus. In these cases the repetition is intentional: but in others it is accidental.
</p>

<p>
(2) A further instance of this inclination to repeat the sound, -ἥτις ἀειδόντεσσι νεωτάτη ἀμφιπέληται, -appears in the recurrence, at long intervals, and in quite different connections, of the same rare word, or of the same collocation of words, or of the same form of expression. Thus the Epic and lyric ἄфар occurs three times in the Trachiniae, and nowhere else in Sophocles. So ἢ ῥα, several times in the Ajax and in no other play. The hemistich θάρσει παρέσται occurs twice in the O. C. (305,726), and τὸ κλεινὸν Ἑλλάδος twice in the Electra (681, 694). So οὐδ᾽ ἀνίεσαν

(3) The Philoctetes, as already noticed (p. 27), is singular in having several instances (in the last commos) of tmesis of verbs compounded with ἀπό: and also in the frequent repetition of monosyllabic words in excited utterance. The following are examples of the latter tendency :-

</p>

<p>
 The reading in some of the above instances, as well as in others of this kind, has been doubted. But while it is freely admitted that the scribes may have sometimes repeated a word by mistake, it must be allowed, on the other hand, that the tendency in question is sufficiently evident to be taken into account. The context, with the analogy of other passages, must decide in each case whether the MS. reading is tenable. The repetition of the same word is of itself no objection to any reading.

Concluding Remarks on Grammatical Construction in Sophocles. In the preceding sections many idioms have been included which can be paralleled from other Greek writers, especially the tragedians; while, on the other hand, no collection of scattered instances can adequately represent the peculiarities of a writer whose strength lies in the <gloss>callida junctura,</gloss> and the subordination of parts to the whole. It has been impossible adequately to distinguish (a) between the remains of earlier syntax, and the novelties of the transition age; (6) between the phenomena of earlier Attic generally and those of the Tragic dialect; and (c) between the individual tendencies of Sophocles and those which he shares with Aeschylus or Euripides. But enough has probably been said to confirm the impression which many readers of Sophocles must have already formed, that the difficulties, inherent in the Greek of this period, which I attempted to characterize at the outset, are complicated in his case by a singular union of great subtilty with great simplicity.
</p>

<p>
This part of the subject may be appropriately concluded with a few general remarks.
</p>

<list>

<item>
1. Sophocles has the keenest feeling for the analogies of language.</item>
<item>
2. This subtle reflective tendency is perpetually causing slight modifications or extensions of idioms in ordinary use.</item>
<item>
3. The overlogical spirit, or κομψότης, of his day shows itself in various inversions, substitutions, and other indirect modes of expression.</item>
<item>
4. Also in minute verbal parallelisms, antitheses, and paradoxes, which, if somewhat strained in themselves, are made conducive to the principal effect.</item>
<item>
5. This analytical spirit is accompanied by a continual effort in the opposite direction of concentration.</item> <pb n="87"/>
<item>
6. From both the last mentioned causes there results a peculiar fulness and redundancy of expression, arising partly from the determination to be explicit, and partly from the combination and grouping of ideas.</item>
<item>
7. The singularity of Sophocles consists not in any or all of these characteristics, which are in some degree common to his age, but in his subtle treatment of them, the harmony in which he binds them together, and above all the grace with which he adapts them to the dramatic expression of natural human feeling.</item>
<item>
8. The relation of metre to language is not to be lost sight of. The word 'exigency' which is sometimes used in this connexion is inapplicable to a poet's work. But the correlation between speech and rhythm, as they react upon each other, is notwithstanding a reality. The Senarius for example, as compared with the Hexameter, is obviously favourable to compression, to connected periods, to synaphea, to the elaboration of a symmetrical and carefully articulated whole. Even the increase of contracted forms in Attic Greek may have owed something to the theatre as well as to the agora.</item>
<item>
9. The interpreter of Sophocles must think more of the sequence of ideas than of the apparent grammatical connexion of the words: and the critic of the text of Sophocles must ask, not, Is such and such a phrase exact in point of syntax? but, (1) Is it natural? (2) Is it poetical and rhythmical? (3) Is it dramatically suitable and expressive?</item> </list>

PART II.- PECULIARITIES OF DICTION.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">

<p>
 If the poet of a transition age in literature is less fettered than his predecessors or successors in the use of grammatical constructions, he enjoys a still more acknowledged liberty in the choice of words. It would seem at first sight as if all the resources of the spoken and written language were at the disposal of his invention. There are, however, limits to this freedom. No one now supposes, with Aristotle, that a great author ever absolutely created a new word; and if there are words in Shakespeare (e. g. <quote>blood-boltered,</quote> <quote>scamels</quote>) to the origin of which we have no clue, this is set to the account of our ignorance, and not of his caprice. It is true that the existence of inflexions in Greek, or rather the fresher consciousness of the meaning of inflexions, gave scope for a degree of licence which has never been possible in any modern language. But this licence is very sparingly employed, and is more seen in the use of compounds than in the formation of new derivatives from single stems. And even in the selection and adaptation of existing words, the innovations  <pb n="88"/>   of the poet are subject to the following conditions :-(1) They must be founded on the actual state of diction; (2) They must be more or less in accordance with prevailing tendencies; (3) Words taken from the early literature, or from a foreign dialect, must not be too far removed from customary use, and must be such as are already known in some way by those for whom the composition is intended. Much also depends on the kind of composition. Thus, words which are suitable to the style of a lyric ode would be out of place in tragic dialogue, many others are forbidden by proprieties of metre, and many expressions are appropriate in tragedy which an historical writer would reject as too ornamental for his purpose; although it is to be remembered that the distinction between poetry and prose was less absolute in the age of Sophocles than at a later time.
</p>

<p>
 Before entering on the consideration of the special peculiarities of any writer in point of diction, it would be well to have a clear and adequate conception of the vocabulary that lay at his command. To give this in the case of Sophocles, however, would be to produce, not one lexilogus, but several. The diction of the Iliad and still more of the Odyssey, that of the Epic Cycle, whose special peculiarities are unknown to us, that of the lyric poets, including Pindar, of the gnomic poets, including Theognis, Solon, and Simonides, must be presupposed. But Herodotus, who reflects the cultured intelligence of the Ionic cities in the former half of the fifth century в. с., is of more immediate importance for the study of tragic diction than any of these. In comparing him with Sophocles we are led to think that the Attic dialect, on which the Athenian agora and theatre worked many potent changes, must at first have had much more in common with the earlier Ionic than has been commonly imagined.<note n="1">The following words, amongst others, are at once Herodotean and Tragic:- ἀγηλατέω, ἁμαξεύομαι—ἐπαμαξεύομαι, ἀμήνιτος, ἀνέκαθεν, ἀνθυπουργέω, ἀπόνητος, ἀπότιμος, ἀπωστός, βιώσιμος (= βιωτός), βύσσινος, γενέτωρ, γνωσιμαχέω, ἔδαισα, διαλυμαίνομαι, δράμημα, δυσμορφία-δύσμορφος, δυσπετέως, ἑδώλια, ἐκπαγλέομαι, ἐλινύω, Ἑλλάς adj., ἐμφερής, ἐξανασπάω, ἐξανδρόομαι, ἐξεύρημα, έξογκόω, ἐξοπτᾶν, ἔπηλυς, εὐεστώ, εὔστομα (= εὔφημα), εὐσύμβλητος, εὐφρόνη, ζάπλουτος, ἡμερόσκοπος, θεήλατος, θέσπισμα.

</p>

<p>
 The object of the following remarks, however, is not to treat the subject exhaustively, but to point out some of the respects in which the use of words in Sophocles is affected (1) by the stage of language in the age of Pericles, (2) by the poet's peculiar subtilty.
</p>

<p>
 The most general characteristic of the diction of Attic writers before Plato is an imperfect stage of abstraction. Many words are no longer found in the same simple concrete or metaphorical sense as in Homer: while, as contrasted with Xenophon or Demosthenes,  <pb n="89"/>   there is in these writers more of sensuous picturesqueness, and a richer colouring of association about single words, existing together with a certain vagueness and indefiniteness of meaning, especially in the use of words like γνώμη, θυμός, ὀργή, νοῦς, expressing mental states or faculties, and such as φύσις, χρόνος, νόμος, expressing abstract natures or ideas.
</p>

<p>
 In harmony with this state of diction was the prevailing tendency to modify and extend the use of words :-
<list>

<item>
(1) In the endeavour to express abstractions by participles, infinitives, neuter adjectives, and verbal nouns, leading sometimes to the substitution of a verbal noun for an infinitive, or of an infinitive or participle for a noun, and generally to the preference for verbal forms.</item>
<item>
(2) In giving a wider and more general meaning to specific words.</item>
<item>
(3) In arbitrarily assigning to generic words a specific meaning.</item>
<item>
(4) In exchanging the active, neuter, passive, and causative meanings of verbs.</item>
<item>
(5) In the attempt to analyse words, and to use them with (true or false) reference to their etymology.</item>
<item>
(6) In the use of compounds and other novel words, framed after the analogy of existing forms.</item>
<item>
(7) In giving an ethical force to words, whose meaning in the earlier language is merely physical.</item> </list>
</p>

<p>
 These tendencies appear in various modes in all the Attic writers of the fifth century B. c., especially in poetry. In Sophocles they take the peculiar bent of his genius. Not less bold and inventive than Aeschylus in his choice of words, where boldness is suitable, and more original than Euripides, he excels both in the adaptation of his diction to the expression of the finer shades of feeling. Without deserting simplicity, he keeps a rich variety of language in perfect harmony; while, especially in the lyric passages, he avails himself sometimes to an extreme of the suggestive power of many vocables, whose significance was not yet accurately defined. Some association, not perceived to be accidental, some echo of sound, some refinement on the obvious meaning, is made to float before the hearer's mind like the neutral tints which soften and harmonize the colouring of a picture. The same difficulty which attends the determination of construction in Sophocles is present also in the interpretation of single words, arising from the incomplete and fluent state of the language, in which the resolution of ambiguities, the distinction of synonyms, the antithesis of opposites, and the definition of abstract terms, were in an incipient stage, already engaging the activity of reflective thought and fancy, but not yet fixed in use or in theory. To this is added the difficulty, in interpreting a poet for whom treatises περὶ ποιητικῆς had no existence, of discerning the degree of figurativeness in his use of language. Sophocles is ante-rhetorical as well as ante-grammatical.
</p>

<p>
 Most words have been originally metaphors, and metaphors are continually falling into the rank of words. Often, indeed, when a poet has employed a metaphor which strikes the imagination of <pb n="90"/>   the reader or hearer with an impression of novelty, he will forthwith depart from it, regarding it as a mere vehicle of expression, and pass on to another, to which he is often drawn by the association of the first. Most instances of mixed metaphor (e. g. to take arms against a sea of troubles<gloss>$2</gloss>) are to be explained in this way. Often, too, just as the form of a sentence is altered in process of construction, a poetical image changes in the course of expression: e. g.  <cit rend="blockquote"><bibl>Shakespeare, Cymb. iv. 2</bibl><quote> <l part="F">O melancholy!</l> <l>Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find</l> <l>The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare</l> <l>Might easiliest harbour in?</l></quote> </cit>      Here melancholy is first a fathomless ocean, but is presently personified as one sailing over a shoreless sea. The imagination is not satisfied even with this, but goes on to suppose the sluggish barge of melancholy finding rest at last, if she can ever find it, against the oozy bank of some slow stream. The indefiniteness of the image is not a fault of style, but rather adds to the effect. So in the O. T. of Sophocles:- <cit rend="blockquote"><bibl>Soph. OT 23</bibl> <quote>     <l part="F">κἀνακουφίσαι κάρα</l>     <l>βυθῶν ἔτ᾽ οὐχ οἷα τε φοινίου σάλου,</l></quote> </cit>   where the city is first compared to a ship in distress, and the ship in distress is again compared to an animal all but devoured by some cruel monster, the confusion or reduplication of imagery, rendered easier by the frequency of the nautical metaphor (see below, p. 105), enhances the impressiveness of the passage.
</p>

<p>
 The following collection of instances is intended to illustrate (1) The experimental use of abstractions, including the modification in the meaning of words through ethical reflection : (2) The interchange of transitive, intransitive, and causative meanings: (3) Analytical or etymological uses: (4) Peculiarities of compounds and derivatives : (5) Sensuous and suggestive words: (6) Epic and Lyric words and phrases: (7) The use of metaphor.

EXPERIMENTAL USE OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONS
</head>

<p>
  It is sometimes said that poetry abhors abstractions. And this is true in the sense that technical terms, whose meaning has been defined by systematic reasoning, are generally unsuited to the expression of feeling. But if feeling does not choose to borrow from the logical faculty, this is because feeling has her own way of generalizing. And reflective poetry, whether subjective or dramatic, in seeking to idealize feeling, is ever rising into the region of general ideas. (See above, pp. 30, 44.) Hence the partial abstractions which abounded in the time of Sophocles are seized by him as welcome materials for his art. They harmonize with its ideal character, while they assist concentration, and give an air of severity, without detracting from the effect of naturalness and pathos. <pb n="91"/>

 Occasionally, in the less impassioned places, he reproduces perhaps too exactly the sophistical spirit. But more frequently he adapts this feature of the language to his purposes with his usual skill.

 Certain notions, which have a wide range of application, are more completely generalized than in an earlier period, and have also more of a substantial or personal reality than would be attributed to them by a later writer. Such are νόμος, δίκη, καιρὸς χρόνος.

  In this and some other passages the idea of time, although personified, is quite general. (In
<bibl n="Soph. El. 179">El. 179 lyr.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">χρόνος γὰρ εὐμαρὴς θεός,</quote> the personification is complete.) In other cases χρόνος, like αἰών, is not dissociated from the continuance of a single life (

 Other words appear to be in an earlier stage of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
  φύσις,
</p>

<p>
  for example, occurs nowhere in the philosophical sense of universal nature; but means always some particular nature, constitution, birth, or origin. The place where the word has the highest degree of generality is
<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 760">Aj. 760.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅστις ἀνθρώπου φύσιν | βλαστών</quote>-· Who having sprung in the nature of man.<gloss>Other uses of φύσιν and φύσει, ‘by birth, by constitution, by nature, by disposition,</gloss> etc., present various degrees of imperfect abstraction from the meaning of the verbal noun.
</p>

<p>
  ἄνθρωπος
</p>

<p>
  in the singular as well as in the plural is sometimes almost equivalent to the abstract <gloss>mankind.</gloss> Still, though the meaning is general, a typical individual is presented to the imagination.

<p>
 But the incompleteness and indefiniteness of abstractions is chiefly seen in words denoting mental acts and states, such as θυμός, φρόνησις, γνώμη, ὀργή, πόθος, ἐλπίς, ἔρως; or mental powers, such as νοῦς, ψυχή, καρδία, φρήν. Such words are used without the exactness of distinction which was afterwards introduced by reflection and use, the shade of meaning intended being left to be determined by the context:-and they are accompanied with a peculiar feeling of the wonderful nature of man. This phase of ethical or psychological language is familiar to the student of Thucydides, and it is immediately obvious how large must be its <pb n="92"/>   application to the purposes of the dramatic poet. In Sophocles there are various grades of ethical significance, from the simplest lyrical personification, as in
<bibl n="Soph. El. 198">El. 198.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">δόλος ἦν ὁ φράσας, ἔρος ὁ κτείνας,</quote> to such quasi-scientific discrimination of terms as in
<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 176">Ant. 176.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ψυχήν τε καὶ φρόνημα καὶ γνώμην,</quote> where however the sophistical parade of words is merely a piece of mannerism, and the attempt to distinguish accurately the connotation of the several terms is not only difficult but illusory.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>
 It will be sufficient to adduce one or two examples of the use of such words in Sophocles. A glance at any lexicon to Sophocles will suggest many others.

 θυμός occurs once only in the seven plays in the sense of <gloss>mind</gloss> or <gloss>memory,</gloss> and in this there is probably a reminiscence of Homer.

  Nearly the same form is used by Jocasta in
<bibl n="Soph. OT 975">O. T. 975.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">μή νυν ἔτ᾿ αὐτῶν μηδὲν ἐς θυμὸν βάλῃς.

Not,</quote> <gloss>Do not cast it in your mind,</gloss> (as in <bibl n="Hdt. 1.84">Hdt. i. 84</bibl>, ἐφράσθη καὶ ἐς θυμὸν ἐβάλετο:

<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 1348">Phil. 1348</bibl>) is spoken of as a real thing or substance, as if separable from the person himself. θυμός is elsewhere the seat or origin of particular emotions, as <gloss>desire,</gloss>

<p>
  This meaning of θυμός, as a principle, is not always easy to distinguish from the more special, and in Attic Greek the more common meaning, of a state or condition of anger. Instances in which it has been supposed to mean anger, but where it more probably means an angry or agitated mind, are-
</p>

<p>

<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 493">Ant. 493.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">φιλεῖ δ᾽ ὁ θυμὸς πρόσθεν ᾑρῆσθαι κλοπεὺς | τῶν μηδὲν ὀρθῶς ἐν σκότῳ τεχνωμένων</quote>-<gloss>And when men are plotting wrong in secret, their distracted mind is oft convicted of concealment before the act.</gloss>

<p>
  In the more limited sense of a condition of anger, θυμός becomes again <gloss>hypostatized,</gloss> and is spoken of as a separate nature or idea.

 The frequent use of the neuter adjective or participle with the article, which is characteristic of the Greek of this period, affords further illustration of the effort to give expression to the general notions which the mind was forming for herself. Sophoclean instances are-

<p>
 The vagueness of abstract notions, and the tendency to form them, together with the absence of definitions, lead to the extension of words from a special to a more general meaning, and also to the specializing of general words, for want of the distinctions that are required for the exact expression of a specific idea. Both uses may be described as vague, and arise from the same uncertainty in the distribution of general terms.

   Even words of such general meaning as πράσσω, πρᾶξις, ἔργον, ἐσθλός, κακός, are often used by Sophocles, where a specific expression would be required in any modern language. See esp.

Aj. 132-133">Aj. 132-133.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τοὺς δὲ σώφρονας | θεοὶ φιλοῦσι καὶ στυγοῦσι τοὺς κακούς,</quote> where κακούς is made the contrary of σώφρονας, a more specific word. Sometimes the specific meaning intended is not strictly contained in the generic word employed. See e.g.
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 887">Tr. 887</bibl>, where ὕβρις is applied to suicide; and
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 207">Phil. 207</bibl>, where ἀνάγκη is used for extreme difficulty.

 On the other hand, some words are made to drop their particular significance and to express a simple and general idea.
</p>

<p>
  The most obvious example of this is in the number of words which are almost equivalent to εἰμί :-βεβηκέναι, ἥκειν, καθεστάναι, ἑστάναι, κεῖσθαι, πέλειν, τυγχάνειν, κυρεῖν, φαίνεσθαι, which have always some special appropriateness to the context in which they are found, but hardly convey more than the simple meaning of the substantive verb.

  The adjectives διάτορος, ὁμόσπορος, ὁμογενής, νομάς, δύσφορος, νηλής, ἡλιοστερής, ὀκνηρός, εὐτυχής, and others, are used sometimes in an active as well as in a neuter or passive sense. (In some cases, of course (διατόρος, etc.), the accentuation is changed.)

ANALYTICAL OR ETYMOLOGICAL USES
</head>
  <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
<p>
 While usage was comparatively unfixed and reflection was already actively employed on language, there was a natural tendency to make experiments through the analysis of words. Having more of the original meaning than afterwards, words can be used more freely, and thus admit of wider application; while on the other hand they are objects of curiosity, and attention is drawn to their essential significance. One case of this analytical activity has been already noticed (p. 27, B), where the preposition in composition acquires a separate force.
<bibl n="Soph. OT 175">O. T. 175.</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄλλον δ᾽ ἂν ἄλλῳ προσίδοις.</quote>

ANALYTICAL OR ETYMOLOGICAL USES
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>
 Ionic Greek as well as Attic poetry delights in compounds, and tragedy retains considerable freedom in their use, although from frequent repetition the less emphatic element in a compound word is often comparatively insignificant. (Cp. the following Hesiodic compounds, ἀδώτης, ἀμβολιεργός, πρωτηρότης, ἀκροκνέφαιος, ὀρθρόγοος, ἡμερό- κοιτος, and words like αὐτογενής, κρεισσότεκνος in Aeschylus.)
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.1" n="">

<p>
There is more freedom than appears afterwards in compounding stems with prepositions, especially ἐκ and ἐν. Thus, ἀναδοχή, ἀποβλαστάνω, ἀπορθόω (cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 757E">Plat. Legg. 757 E</bibl>), ἐκθεῶμαι, ἐκκομπάζω, ἐκλήγω, ἐκλωβάω, ἐκλωπίζω, ἐκπέλει=ἔξεστι, ἐκπροτιμῶ, ἐκχράω, ἔμπολις, ἔνεδρος, ἐνθακέω, ἐνθαλάσσιος, ἐξαμαρτία, ἐξατιμάζω, ἐξαπεῖδον, ἐξαυδάω, ἐξελευθεροστομέω, ἐξευτρεπίζω, ἐξεφίεμαι, ἐξικετεύω, ἐξοικήσιμος, ἐξόμιλος, ἐξύπερθε, καταυδάω, are all new compounds.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.2" n="2">

<p>
A complex predicate or attribute is sometimes expressed by a rare compound; e.g. ἀνάνδρωτος, ἀριστόχειρ, ἀρτίκολλος, ἀρτίχριστος, ἀρχέπλουτος, δίπαλτος, δολόμυθος, ἡδύπολις, κοινότοκος, λιθόλευστος, μελάγχολος, σιτόνομος, τελεόμηνος, τρυσάνωρ, ὑψίπολις, χαλαργός, χαλκόπλακτος.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.3" n="3">

<p>
On the other hand, a simple attribute is often expressed by a compound adjective, the inferior part of which repeats some notion which is already implied in the noun or other neighbouring word. This is especially frequent with the compounds of πούς; e.g. δεινόπους ἀρά (ἐλᾷ), χαλκόπους ὀδός (threshold of brazen floor), ὠκύπους ἀγών, νόμοι πρόκεινται ὑψίποδες, κοινόπους παρουσία, δολιόπους ἀρωγός. Other combinations are δυσπάρευνον λέκτρον, λαθί- πονον ὀδυνᾶν, πολυθύτους σφαγάς (
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 791">Tr. 791</bibl>, 1021, 756), ἄνδρ᾽ ἕν οἰόζωνον (
<bibl n="Soph. OT 846">O. T. 846</bibl>), πυκνόπτεροι ἀηδόνες (
<bibl n="Soph. OC 17-18">O. C. 17-18</bibl>). But though frequently redundant, the less prominent part of a compound is hardly ever wholly irrelevant in Sophocles.

 Favourite words denoting colour and form, such as κελαινός, χλωρός, κοῖλος, are often made to suggest more than they express. The disparity between the impressions of colour and form, which were rich and deep, and the vagueness and inarticulateness of the language which described them, may have helped this tendency. <gloss>The dark point of the champion spear,</gloss> κελαινὰ λογχά,

 χλωρός, <gloss>grass-green,</gloss> is applied (1) to the dew of tears (

Perhaps the pale <gloss>yellow</gloss> sand, perhaps the moist,' smooth and glistering sand.

<p>
 Influence of association on the choice of words.
</p>

<p>
  In many passages of the choric songs, as in all lyric poetry, the connection of ideas is often guided rather by association than by any regular sequence either of thought or fact. A typical instance of this is supplied by the stasimon of the Trachiniae in which the long chain of causes which have led to the pain of Heracles are crushed together in a few words so that the links can hardly be separated (
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 836-40">Tr. 836-40</bibl>): <gloss>He is steeped in the dreadful apparition of the Hydra,</gloss> i. e. his veins are saturated with poison from the wound made by the arrow of Hercules, which he had steeped in the venom of the Hydra, that dreadful monster. <gloss>And mingled therewith the murderous stings of crafty speech from the Centaur burst forth upon him and torment him;</gloss> i. e. this poison, which breaks out in stinging sores, was applied in consequence of the guileful advice of the Centaur, given with intent to cause his death, and this fact adds <pb n="104"/> to the cruelty of the torment. The attentive consideration of this passage may prepare the way for an interpretation of Antigone 599-603, which might otherwise appear strained :— <gloss>The light of life that still was spread above the last remaining fibre of the stock of Oedipus, is again swept down (see notes in loco) by the dust consecrated to the infernal gods, which is (1) bloodstained, (2) cruel (both expressed in powía), and by madness of thought and infatuation of mind;</gloss> i. e. By sprinkling dust on Polynices, to which she is prompted by mad reasoning and heaven-sent fury, Antigone is herself overwhelmed by the dust of death, so quenching the last hope of the house of Oedipus. When thus read in the light of association, the words are seen to be more harmonious than if κόνις be exchanged for κόπις, which introduces a grotesque and commonplace image that has nothing to do with the story.

EPIC AND LYRIC WORDS AND PHRASES
</head>

<p>
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>  That a large element of Tragic Greek is derived from Epic and Lyric poetry is a patent fact. Whether words and phrases which Sophocles has in common with Homer were taken by him from the Iliad and Odyssey, or from some other source, cannot clearly be determined. The following are a few typical examples of Epic and Lyric diction.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.1" n="1">

<p>
 Words and phrases seeming to be directly borrowed from the Epic diction are ἀμφηκής, ἀνάρσιος, ἕκατι, ἦμος, ὁδίτης, ῥίγησαν, ὠρώρει, ἀμφιχανών, ἄναλκις, ἀπείργαθον, ἀτίζω; ἀτρύγετος, Fr. 423; αὖθι, Fr. 468 ; βαθύρρους; πολύτλας (of Odysseus); ναμέρτεια (from νημερτής); κοίλην κάπετον; ὦ μοι ἐγώ, τί πάθω ; ἐνέδησεν ἄτα.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.2" n="2">

<p>
 Sometimes an Epic word is used, but with some modification of meaning; e. g. θοὰν νύμφαν, <gloss>a bride swiftly borne;</gloss> ἀμενηννὸν ἄνδρα, <gloss>the lost hero;</gloss> λakev, sounded forth,' of an oracle; didnλos, κλυτός, ἀριφραδής, ἐν φίλαισι χερσίν (
<bibl n="Soph. El. 1138">El. 1138</bibl>).
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.3" n="3">

<p>
 Or an Attic phrase is so turned as to recal the Homeric idiom, as in ἐπίπονον ἡμέραν like δούλιον ἦμαρ, Ἰφίτου βίαν like βίη Ηρακληείη, φίλτατον .. κάρα like φίλη κεφαλή, δι' αἰθέρα τεκνωθέντες, cp. αὐθρηγενής. With these may be classed such epithets, having an Epic colouring, as πάτραν διήνεμον,
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 327">Tr. 327</bibl>; νηὶ ποικιλοστόλῳ,
<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 343">Phil. 343.</bibl>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.4" n="4">

<p>
 Many words are used which are common to Epic and Lyric, but rare in Attic Greek; e. g. ἄφαρ, ἀφνεός, ὁρῶμαι (middle voice), ἀτάλλω, ζαμενής, αἴθων, ἀμαιμάκετος, ἀντάω (=τυγχάνω), ἀτύζεσθαι, πορεῖν, οὔλιος, ἠπύω, ὀμφή, αἰπύς, ἦ ῥα, ἐπίηρα φέρειν, αἰνός, χρύσεος (*), <gloss>glorious,</gloss> χάλκεος, <gloss>indestructible.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.5" n="5">

<p>
 Others are Lyric but not Epic:-βαρυαχής, καλλιβόας, πολύπονος.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.6" n="6">

 A few, such as τᾶλις, <gloss>a damsel,</gloss> are of doubtful, and perhaps of foreign origin.

KINDS AND DEGREES OF METAPHOR
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>
 The language of Sophocles is for the most part not highly figurative. But some images are so familiar in Attic poetry that they almost cease to be metaphors, and (see above, p. 92) are to be viewed merely as words. The tendency to abstraction, giving the power of fixing the attention on the leading notion of a word, apart from the particular associations, contributed to this.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.1" n="1">

<p>
 The most familiar of all images to an Athenian audience were those connected with the sea. Such expressions as <gloss>The haven of a cry,</gloss> <gloss>Sailing into a harbourless marriage,</gloss> <gloss>The long and rough voyage from Thebes to Athens,</gloss> are less figurative in Attic Greek than they would be in other languages. (Cp. <bibl n="Hdt. 3.155">Hdt. iii. 155</bibl>, <quote xml:lang="grc">§ 3. ἐξέπλωσας τῶν φρενῶν.) When we speak of a government being wrecked on a certain measure, our imagination seldom reverts to the figure of a shipwreck, or of a sunken rock, and something of the kind is true of the use of λιμήν, ὅρμος, σαλεύω, ὀρθόω (to right the vessel), πλοῦς, ξύμπλους, οὖρος, κατουρίζω, ἐρέσσειν, and the like words in Sophocles. This nautical imagery is a vehicle of expression which is always at hand. Hence, while mixed metaphors are allowable, and the figurative language is often not to be pressed, an occasional hyperbolical boldness is easily accounted for.</quote> <gloss>The whole Crissean plain was filled with equestrian shipwrecks.</gloss> <gloss>He avoided the boiling surge of horses with their riders</gloss> (
<bibl n="Soph. El. 729-733">El. 729-733</bibl>). The same remark applies in a less degree to other familiar aspects of life, such as war, the public games, wrestling, running, archery, health and disease, fair weather and storm, ploughing, sowing, reaping, etc.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.2" n="2">

<p>
 Another kind of familiarity belonged to images that had been used in the earlier poetry. Such figures as the <gloss>cloud of grief,</gloss> or <gloss>the fire of destruction,</gloss> <gloss>he grew up like a young plant,</gloss> which had been consecrated by Homer, could be handled with greater freedom than those which were of recent invention, such as <gloss>The unbending oak borne down by the torrent.</gloss> (
<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 714">Ant. 714.</bibl><quote xml:lang="grc">) They could be extended and modified like grammatical idioms and the uses of words. This cause also gives rise to mixtures or transitions of metaphor,</quote> <gloss>Guile-woven fate anoints him with the Centaur's gory cloud,</gloss> <gloss>My cloud of darkness coming over me, like a ship wafted by too sure a gale,</gloss> <gloss>The battle God is burning me with shouts of onset.</gloss> (
<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 831">Tr. 831</bibl>,
<bibl n="Soph. OT 1314">O. T. 1314</bibl>,
<bibl n="Soph. OT 191">Ib. 191.</bibl>)
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.3" n="3">

<p>
There is also a class of words originally metaphorical, which are not felt to be so, because the analogy on which their meaning rests is not sufficiently remote to give the impression of poetical imagery. These can hardly be distinguished from the generalized uses mentioned in p. 94. Such expressions as <gloss>to merchandize advantage,</gloss> <gloss>to feed on hopes,</gloss> <gloss>to bind in a tomb-like chamber,</gloss> <gloss>the oared vehicle of a ship,</gloss> <gloss>to give the ship her head</gloss> (ναῒ μεθεῖναι), although not literal, are hardly figurative.

 The Peculiarities of Language in Sophocles considered with reference to the settlement of the Text.
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
<p>
 Some such review of the language of Sophocles as that which has been imperfectly attempted in this Essay, appears to be necessary in order to interpret him with an approach to certainty. It may also furnish some criterion of the value of emendations of the text. The minute study of the MSS., the Scholia, and the notices of the grammarians, is of course indispensable to this end. But the most perfect <term>apparatus criticus</term> may be only illusory, and may encourage an opinio copiae, which is inter causas inopiae, if it is made the basis of conjectural alteration, without a right conception of the original woof and texture of the <gloss>old garment,</gloss> which is thus patched.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.1" n="1">

<p>
 Many places would never have been suspected of corruption, if the unfixed, growing, and transitional nature of the language had been fully recognized. Subtle and cautious scholars like Hermann and Elmsley were more conscious of this than most of their successors. But their fine perceptions of certain nuances of style and idiom, for want of some systematic statement of them, have often passed unregarded, and were not sufficiently carried into application even by themselves. Had they more fully expressed themselves on this subject, they would have produced a critical instrument of finer temper and more effective although more delicate use, than without this can be forged from palaeographical materials, and the expedients which these suggest.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.2" n="2">

<p>
 This subject has lately received an illustration from the disputes which have arisen about the text of Shelley. If that poet's subtle use of language has given rise to supposed emendations, sometimes on the part of those who had lived with him and knew his mind, and if rational criticism has been brought to set aside most of those changes within half a century of his death, how hazardous must such attempts be in the case of Sophocles, or, still more, in that of Aeschylus, of whose meaning Aristophanes could doubt (Ran. 920 foll.), although in the latter case the attempt is justified by frequent and manifest corruptions.
</p>

<p>
 How many conjectural alterations of Shakspeare have been exploded through closer study of Elizabethan English! How few, comparatively speaking, have been established! And yet they were mostly the inventions of ingenious Englishmen, sometimes of poets, whose mother tongue was that of Shakspeare, and who had known Shakspeare all their lives. How much <gloss>farther off,</gloss> as Plato would say, the most accomplished foreigner must necessarily appear in such an endeavour, may be roughly measured by comparing two wrong readings, that of 'physician' for 'precisian' in M. W. W. 2, 1, which Dyce adopted, and <gloss>he smote his leaded pole-axe on the ice,</gloss> which a good German critic has suggested as an <term>emendation</term> of Ham. 1, 12. Neither of these conjectures is true; but which of them is more like truth no Englishman can for a moment doubt. And there is a <pb n="107"/>  difference not less wide between such corrections as Boeckh's φονώ- σαισιν for φοινίαισιν in
<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 118">Ant. 118</bibl>, or Arndt's εὐνάτειρα for θυγάτηρ in
<bibl n="Soph. OT 1112">O. T. 1112</bibl>, and scores of other conjectures that have been made in either play.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.3" n="3">

<p>
 There must still always be a degree of uncertainty in defending MS. readings of the tenth century, because our general conception of what is likely (the 'veri simile' of Lachmann) is based on the whole text which is the subject of dispute. But the close and analytical study of that text may, at least, enable us to reject proposed emendations, which, although not without plausibility on palaeographical, metrical, grammatical, and other technical grounds, may safely be pronounced alien to Sophocles, either as not poetical, or not idiomatic, or as interfering with the natural emphasis and rhythm, or as out of harmony with the context. Mistrust is not unreasonable, when such obvious rhetorical effects as the hesitation of Deianira, and the pleading iteration of Philoctetes, are found to be persistently ignored. We are often justified in saying, Sophocles may have written what we find: he cannot have written what is proposed instead. It has not the Sophoclean colouring; it is like a raw touch on a picture ill-restored.

 One object of this Essay will have been served, if it should be found to have contributed anything towards supplying the desideratum which is here indicated.

<p>
 In the foregoing pages I have not taken account of differences in point of language between the several Plays. Such differences exist, but are scarcely marked enough to be exhibited in a tabular form.
</p>

<p>
 It may be well, however, to remind the student who desires to pursue this subject, that the order of the Plays, which is followed for convenience in this edition, is not that of their production. The Oedipus Coloneus, if not the last of the seven, is probably much later than either the Antigone or the Oedipus Rex, and has been thought to share with the Philoctetes, and in a measure also with the Trachiniae, some traces of an altered manner, in which the popular influences, which were so powerful with Euripides, were not without their effect.
</p>

<p>
 The language of the Oedipus Rex is the most highly wrought, while that of the Electra is the simplest. The Antigone, rivalling the Oedipus Rex in energy, has far more directness of expression. The Philoctetes is marked by studied ease and vernacular freedom, reminding the English reader of those poems of Shelley-such as Julian and Maddalo-in which, without losing poetical grace and finish, he reflects the tone of actual conversation. The Ajax approaches the most nearly to an Epic manner, and displays a peculiar fulness in the utterance of passionate feeling. The Trachiniae is pervaded by a singular tenderness and delicacy. The difference of style between the dialogue and the lyrical portions is most marked in the Oedipus Coloneus.
