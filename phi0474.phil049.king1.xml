                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>ON at last securing a complete or at any rate a considerable release from the toils of advocacy<ref n="3.1">¹</ref> and from my senatorial duties, I have once more—chiefly, Brutus, on your encouragement—returned to those studies, which, though stored in memory, had been put aside through circumstances, and are now revived after a long interval of neglect. My view was that, inasmuch as the system and method of instruction in all the arts which have a bearing upon the right conduct of life is bound up with the study of wisdom which goes by the name of philosophy, it was incumbent on me to throw light upon that study by a work in the Latin tongue; not that philosophy could not be learnt from Greek writers and teachers, but it has always been my conviction that our countrymen have shown more wisdom everywhere than the Greeks, either in making discoveries for themselves, or else in improving upon what they had received from Greece—in such subjects at least as they had judged worthy of the devotion of their efforts.<ref n="3.2">²</ref></p>

               <pb n="5"/>
               our ancestors have adopted better regulations and laws than others in directing the policy of government. What shall I say of the art of war? In this sphere our countrymen have proved their superiority by valour as well as in an even greater degree by discipline. When we come to natural gifts apart from book-learning they are above comparison with the Greeks or any other people. Where has such earnestness, where such firmness, greatness of soul, honesty, loyalty, where has such surpassing merit in every field been found in any of mankind to justify comparison with our ancestors?</p>

            <div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="section">

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>In learning Greece surpassed us and in all branches of literature, and victory was easy where there was no contest. For while with the Greeks the poets are the oldest literary class, seeing that Homer and Hesiod lived before the foundation of Rome and Archilochus<ref n="5.1">¹</ref> lived in the reign of Romulus, poetry came to us at a later date. About five hundred and ten years after the foundation of Rome Livius produced a play in the consulship of C. Claudius, son of Caecus, and M. Tuditanus in the year before the birth of Ennius, who was older than Plautus and Naevius.<ref n="5.2">²</ref></p>
         
               <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/> At a late date then were poets either known or welcomed by our countrymen. Though it is stated in the <hi rend="italics">Origines</hi>
                  <ref n="5.3">³</ref> that guests were in the habit of singing at banquets in honour of the virtues of famous men to the playing of a piper, yet a speech of Cato's shows that this kind of talent was not held in respect, for in it he censured M. Nobilior for having, as he declares, taken poets in his suite to his province. It is, as we know, matter of fact that Nobilior when consul had taken Ennius<ref n="5.4">⁴</ref> to Aetolia. The lighter then the esteem in which poetry was
               <pb n="7"/>
               held, the less was the devotion paid to it, and yet such writers as have by virtue of great natural endowments proved themselves poets, have not failed to be a worthy match for the glory of the Greeks.</p>
                  </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="section"><p>Or do we suppose that if Fabius Pictor, a man of noble family, had managed to win fame for his painting,<ref n="7.1">¹</ref> we too should not have had many a Polyclitus<ref n="7.2">²</ref> and Parrhasius? Public esteem is the nurse of the arts, and all men are fired to application by fame, whilst those pursuits which meet with general disapproval, always lie neglected. The Greeks held that the proof of the highest education was found in instrumental and vocal music: thus it is that Epaminondas, to my mind the leading man in Greek history, was, we are told, an accomplished singer to the accompaniment of the harp, whilst Themistocles, to go back many years previously, was held to show a lack of culture in refusing to play the lyre at banquets. Musicians accordingly flourished in Greece; everyone would learn music, and the man who was unacquainted with the art was not regarded as completely educated.</p>

            <div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="section">
               <p>With the Greeks geometry was regarded with the utmost respect, and consequently none were held in greater honour than mathematicians, but we Romans have restricted this art to the practical purposes of measuring and reckoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>But on the other hand we speedily welcomed the orator—not at first the cultivated but the ready speaker and at a later date the cultivated orator. For Galba, Africanus and Laelius were, as tradition has told us, well-read, while Cato who preceded them was a diligent student; next came Lepidus, Carbo and the Gracchi;<ref n="7.3">³</ref> after them up to our day
               <pb n="9"/>
               orators of such power that little or no ground at all was yielded in favour of the Greeks. Philosophy has lain neglected to this day, and Latin literature has thrown no light upon it: it must be illuminated and exalted by us, so that, if in the active business of life I have been of service to my countrymen, I may also, if I can, be of service to them in my leisure.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="section">
               <p>And I must exert myself all the more actively because there are now, it is said, a number of books in Latin<ref n="9.1">¹</ref> written without due care by writers who with all their merits are yet insufficiently equipped. Now it is possible for an author to hold right views and yet be unable to express them in a polished style; but to commit one's reflections to writing, without being able to arrange or express them clearly or attract the reader by some sort of charm, indicates a man who makes an unpardonable misuse of leisure and his pen. The result is that such writers read their own books themselves along with their own circle, and none of them reaches any wider public than that which wishes to have the same privilege of scribbling extended to itself. For this reason, if by my assiduity I have won for our countrymen some measure of oratorical renown, I shall with far greater enthusiasm lay bare the springs of philosophy, which were also the source from which those earlier efforts of mine took their rise.</p>

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>But just as Aristotle,<ref n="9.2">²</ref> a man of supreme genius, knowledge and fertility of speech, under the stimulus of the fame of the rhetorician Isocrates,<ref n="9.3">³</ref> began like him to teach the young to speak and combine
               <pb n="11"/>
               wisdom with eloquence, similarly it is my design not to lay aside my early devotion to the art of expression, but to employ it in this grander and more fruitful art: for it has ever been my conviction that philosophy in its finished form enjoys the power of treating the greatest problems with adequate fulness and in an attractive style. To this endeavour I devoted myself with such energy that I actually reached the point of venturing to give dissertations in the manner of the Greeks: for instance, recently after your departure, as there were a number of close friends staying with me, I attempted in my house at Tusculum to see what I could do in this sort of exercise: for just as in my youth I used to be constantly declaiming speeches for the courts—and no one ever did so longer—so this is now a declamation<ref n="11.1">¹</ref> of my old age. I called upon my friends to put forward any subject which any of them wished to hear discussed, and this I debated either as I sat or walked about.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="8" subtype="section">
               <p>The result is that I have put together into five books the dissertations, as the Greeks term them, of as many days. The procedure was that, after the would-be listener had expressed his view, I opposed it. This, as you know, is the old Socratic method of arguing against your adversary's position; for Socrates thought that in this way the probable truth was most readily discovered; but in order that the course of our discussions may be more conveniently followed I shall put them before you in the form of a debate and not in narrative form.

                  <speaker>A.</speaker> How do you mean?</p>
               <p>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker> In this way: if death had been wretchedness even for the dead, we should have been subject in life to an unlimited and eternal condition of evil: as it is I see a goal, and when we have reached it there is nothing left to be so much afraid of. But you seem to me to agree with the aphorism of Epicharmus,<ref n="19.2">2</ref> who was, as one expects in a Sicilian, a man of keen insight and not without taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker> What aphorism? I am not acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker> I shall give it if I can in Latin: you know I am no more in the habit of using Greek in speaking Latin than of using Latin in speaking Greek.</p>
               <p>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker> Quite right. But what, pray, is this aphorism of Epicharmus?</p>

               <p>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker> Because, inasmuch as after death there is no evil, death, which is at once succeeded by time in which by your admission there is no evil, is not an evil either: it follows that to have to die is not an evil either, for it means having to reach a condition which we admit is not an evil.</p>

Some consider death the separation of the soul from the body; some think there is no such separation, but that soul and body perish together and the soul is annihilated with the body. Of those who think that there is a separation of the soul some hold that it is at once dispersed in space, others that it survives a long time, others that it survives for ever. Further, as to what the soul itself is in itself, or where its place in us, or what its origin, there is much disagreement. Some think the soul is the actual heart, and so we get the words "without heart," "wanting heart" and "of one heart," meaning "senseless," "feeble-minded" and "of one mind"; and the wise statesman Nasica,<ref n="23.1">1</ref> twice consul, got the name of "Goodheart" or "Sagacious," and so too

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>These, unless I happen to have missed any, are pretty nearly the views held about the soul. There is, it is true, Democritus,<ref n="29.2">2</ref> a man of undoubted power, but, as he makes the soul consist of minute smooth round bodies brought together in some sort of accidental collision, let us pass him over; for there is nothing which thinkers of his school cannot construct out of a swarm of atoms. </p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker> My wish would be for both courses if it could be managed, but it is a difficult matter to combine the two. Therefore if, without discussing these further questions, we can get free from the fear of death, let this be our aim; but if that is impossible, unless this problem of the nature of the soul is first unravelled, let us take that problem first and the other question later.</p>
               <p>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker> I think the course I understand you to prefer is the more convenient; for rational investigation will show that, whichever of the views I have stated is the true one, death is either not an evil or, better, a positive good.</p>

               <p>For if the soul is the heart or blood or brain, then assuredly, since it is material, it will perish with the rest of the body; if it is breath it will perhaps be dispersed in space; if fire it will be quenched; if it is the harmony of Aristoxenus

               it will vanish away. Why speak of Dicaearchus, a thinker who says the soul is nothing at all? According to all these views nothing can appertain to anyone after death, for along with life is lost the power of sensation; moreover there is nothing to make any sort of difference to a being without sensation. The views of the rest of the teachers offer the hope, if this happen to rejoice you, that souls, on their separation from the body, find their way to heaven as to their dwelling-place.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker> As for authorities for that view which you wish to see established, we can employ the highest, a point which in all cases ought to have great weight and usually does so: and, to begin with, we can quote all antiquity which, it may be, had a clearer vision of the truth in proportion to its nearness to its origin and divine ancestry.</p>

<note n="29.1">It looks as if Cicero had confused two different words, ἐνδελέχεια and ἐντελέχεια. In Aristotle the word used is ἐvτελéxεια, actus, perfectio, the perfect state of a thing: ἐνδελέχεια on the other hand is continuatio, as when the constant dropping of water hollows out stone. This is movement, and Aristotle denies any movement to the soul. It seems then that if Cicero wrote ἐντελέχεια he has given it a wrong meaning: if he wrote ἐνδελέχεια he has not used Aristotle's word. That the difficulty about the two words is a very old one is shown by Lucian's Δίκη Φωκαέντων 10, where δέλτα accuses ταῦ of filching ἐνδελέχεια illegally and getting it turned into ἐντελέχεια.

If it survives unadulterated and unchanged in substance, it is of necessity carried away so rapidly as to pierce and part asunder all this atmosphere of ours, in which clouds, storms and winds collect because of the moisture and mist produced by evaporation from the earth. When the soul has passed this tract and reaches to and recognizes a substance resembling its own, it stops amongst the fires which are formed of rarefied air and the modified glow of the sun and ceases to make higher ascent. For when it has reached conditions of lightness and heat resembling its own, it becomes quite motionless, as though in a state of equilibrium with its surroundings, and then, and not before, finds its natural home, when it has pierced to conditions resembling its own, and there, with all its needs satisfied, it will be nourished and maintained on the same food which maintains and nourishes the stars.<ref n="53.1">1</ref></p>

As if indeed they understood its nature, its shape, its size, its position whilst actually in the body. But supposing for the moment that all that is now concealed were discernible in the living man, would it seem likely that the soul could come within the scope of vision, or rather be of such fine substance as to escape the eye?</p>

For unless we are unable to realize the nature of what we have never seen, beyond doubt we can form a conception of God Himself and the divine soul set free from the body.

<note n="69.3">Cicero is summing up the teaching of the Phaedo. Absolute justice, beauty, goodness, etc., are “idéal," and knowledge of them cannot be obtained through the senses. These "ideas" are unchanging, are always what they are and do not admit of variation. We acquired knowledge of them before we were born. Objects perceived by the senses are always changing and hardly ever the same. The soul is akin to the invisible and unchanging: the body to the visible and changing. The body drags the soul into the region of the visible and changing, and the soul wanders and is confused. We make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible connection or fellowship with the body. If the soul had had no life apart from its association with the body, it could not have acquired knowledge of the true realities, the "ideas."

Let us, therefore, believe me, make this preparation and dissociation of ourselves from our bodies, that is, let us habituate ourselves to die. This will, both for the time of our sojourn on earth, resemble heavenly life, and when we shall be released from our chains here, the progress of our soul will be less retarded.

The Stoics rejected the assumption of irrational faculties. They held that the soul was a unity: man feels and wills and knows with the whole soul. Cicero sides with Plato; but cf. § 56, where he agrees with Plato's view in the Phaedo 78, that the soul is simplex, uncompounded, ἀσύνθετος.

But suppose, as these thinkers hold, that souls do not survive after death: I see that in that case we are deprived of the hope of a happier life. But what evil does such a view imply? For suppose that the soul perishes like the body: is there then any definite sense of pain or sensation at all in the body after death? There is no one who says so, though Epicurus accuses Democritus of this, but the followers of Democritus deny it. And so there is no sensation in the soul either, for the soul is nowhere. Where, then, is the evil, since there is no third thing? Is it because the actual departure of soul from body does not take place without sense of pain? Though I should believe this to be so, how petty a matter it is! But I think it false, and the fact is that often the departure takes place without sensation, sometimes even with a feeling of pleasure; and the whole thing is trivial, whatever the truth, for departure takes place in a moment of time.</p>

The Neapolitans set garlands on their heads; so, be sure, did the inhabitants of Puteoli; public congratulations kept pouring in from the towns: silly behaviour no doubt and in Greekish taste, but all the same it may count as a proof of good fortune. Had his life come to an end then, would he have left a scene of good or a scene of evil? Certainly he would have escaped wretchedness. He would not have gone to war with his father-in-law,<ref n="101.2">2</ref> he would not have taken up arms when unprepared, he would not have left home, he would not have fled from Italy, he would not have lost his army and fallen unprotected into the hands of armed slaves; his poor

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>Such things are evaded by death, because although they have not taken place, yet they may take place; but men do not think it possible they can happen to themselves: each one hopes for himself the good fortune of Metellus, just as if more men were lucky than unlucky, or there were certainty in men's affairs or hope were wiser than apprehension. </p>

               <p>But let us go so far as to make the admission that mankind are deprived of blessings by death: must we therefore also grant that the dead feel the need of the comforts of life, and that this is a condition of wretchedness?<ref n="103.2">2</ref> Assuredly that is what they must say. Is it possible for the man who does not exist to "feel the need of" anything? The mere term "feeling the need of" has a melancholy sound, because the meaning that underlies it is, he had, he has not; he misses, looks for, wants. These, I think, are the discomforts of one who "feels the need of"; he "feels the need of" eyes, blindness is hateful; of children, barrenness is hateful. This holds good among the living, but as regards the dead, no one "feels the need," I do not say of the comforts of life, but even of life itself. I say this of the dead who do not exist; but do we who exist "feel the need" in this sense of horns or feathers? Can anyone make such a statement? Undoubtedly none. Why so? Because, as you are without that for which you are suited neither by acquired skill nor by nature, you cannot "feel the need of" it, even if you should be conscious that you do not possess it.</p>

            <div type="textpart" n="88" subtype="section">
               <p>This argument must be repeatedly insisted upon when we have firmly established the point, about which, if souls are mortal, we can have no doubt, namely that destruction in death is so complete that not even the faintest vestige of sensation is left behind: when that, then, is properly settled for once and all, we must thoroughly sift, so as to be sure of it, the meaning of "feeling the need of," that there may be no possibility of mistake in using the phrase. This then is the meaning of "feeling the   <pb n="105"/> need of,"<ref n="105.1">1</ref> to be in want of anything you wish to possess; for there is a notion of wish in "feeling the need of,"—except when the word <hi rend="italics">carere</hi> is used in another sense, as for instance of a fever, meaning "to be without fever." For it is using the word in quite a different sense to use it where one has not got something and is conscious of not having it, even if one can readily put up with being without it. To "feel the need of" is not used in connection with evil; for then evil would not be a thing to grieve about: the expression "to feel the need of" a good is used, and that amounts to an evil. But not even a living man "feels the need of" a good, if he does not want it. In the case of a living man it is, however, intelligible to say that you "feel the need of" a throne—that, however, cannot be said quite accurately in your case, though it could have been in the case of Tarquin after he had been dethroned<ref n="105.2">2</ref>—: 
                
                <pb n="107"/>
                still in the case of a dead man it is not even intelligible, for "to feel the need of" is appropriate to a sentient being, and in a dead man there is no sensation in a dead man therefore there is no possibility either of " feeling the need of."</p>

    <p>XXXVII. And yet what need to philosophize where we see that the question does not to any great extent require philosophy? How often have our leaders, and not only they but whole armies, rushed on certain death! If death indeed had been their fear, L. Brutus would not have fallen in battle, preventing the return of the tyrant<ref n="106.1">1</ref> whom he had himself driven out; the elder Decius in desperate conflict with the Latins, his son in conflict with the Etruscans, his grandson fighting Pyrrhus<ref n="106.2">2</ref> would not have flung themselves upon the weapons of the enemy; Spain would not have seen the Scipios<ref n="106.3">3</ref> falling for their country in the selfsame war; Cannae<ref n="106.4">4</ref> would not have seen the fall of Paullus and Geminus, Venusia of Marcellus,<ref n="106.5">5</ref> Litana of Albinus<ref n="106.6">6</ref> and Lucania of Gracchus.<ref n="106.7">7</ref> Can any one of these at the present day be wretched?

    <p>But, it may be objected, the mere absence of sensation is hateful. Hateful, yes, if it meant " feeling the need of"; since, however, it is quite plain that there is nothing left in the man who has no existing self, what can there be hateful where the man has neither feeling of need nor power of sensation ? Too often it is true this notion exists, but it is due to the fact that in it lurks all the shrinking of the soul from the fear of death.

All such things are spoken of as long or short according to the proportion in which they are in each case allotted. By the river Hypanis, which flows into the Pontus from a part of Europe, Aristotle says that a kind of small animal is born, which lives for a single day. One of these creatures then that died in the eighth hour has died at an advanced age; that which died at sunset is decrepit, and all the more if it happen on Midsummer Day. Contrast our longest lifetime with eternity: we shall be found almost in the same category of short-lived beings as those tiny creatures.</p>

There was a Lacedaemonian (and not

                     such utter scorn of death that when, after being
                     sentenced by the ephors, he was led out to execution
                     with a cheerful and joyous look, and an enemy said
                     to him, "Do you scorn the laws of Lycurgus?" he
                     replied: "I am deeply grateful to him for inflicting
                     upon me a penalty which I could pay without borrow-

For after he had discussed the immortality

                     when asked by Crito how he wished to be buried,
                     "My friends," said he, "I have indeed spent a deal

                     bury me as you think fit. But, believe me, none
                     of you will come up with me when I have gone

                     vigorous in the body, however, it is plain that,

                     anything after death. In Ennius Thyestes utters
                     curses in quite magnificent verses, praying first that
                     Atreus may die by shipwreck: a cruel prayer this
                     no doubt; for such an end involves grievous
                     consciousness of death: the following lines are

                     Thyestes imagines he is desiring torments. They
                     would have been cruel, had the victim the power of

                     You see how deep the deception in which they live:
                     he thinks the grave is the body's haven and that
                     the dead man finds peace in the grave, to the great
                     discredit of Pelops for not having instructed his son
                     and taught him what were the limits of anxiety in

                     individuals, since we may observe the varied de-
                     ceptions under which races of mankind labour? The
                     Egyptians embalm their dead and keep them in the
                     house; the Persians even smear them with wax before
                     burial, that the bodies may last for as long a time as
                     possible; it is the custom of the Magi not to bury
                     the bodies of their dead unless they have been
                     first mangled by wild beasts; in Hyrcania the
                     populace support dogs for the benefit of the com-
                     munity, while the nobles keep them for family use :
                     it is as we know a famous breed of dogs, but in
                     spite of the cost, each householder procures animals

                     to mangle him in proportion to his means, and that

                     be treated with contempt as regards ourselves, but
                     not ignored in the case of those connected with
                     us—with this proviso, however, that we, the living,
                     are conscious that the bodies of the dead have no
                     consciousness.</p>

                  <p>Let the living, however, attend to
                     funeral observance to the extent to which they
                     must make a compromise with custom and public
                     opinion, but with the understanding that they
                     realize that in no way does it concern the dead.</p><p>
                     But assuredly death is encountered with most
                     equanimity when the failing life can find solace
                     in the reputation it has won. No one has lived too
                     short a life who has discharged the perfect work
                     of perfect virtue. In my life there have been many
                     occasions when death would have been timely, and
                     would I could have found it! for there was no
                     longer anything to be won; life's duties had been
                     discharged in full; the war with fortune alone
                     remained. If therefore my arguments fail to con-
                     vince us that we can ignore death, yet let a life
                     completed make us think that we have lived
                     sufficiently and more. For though consciousness
                     may have gone, nevertheless the dead, unconscious
                     though they be, are not without their own peculiar
                     blessings of fame and glory. There is, it may be,
                     nothing in glory that we should desire it, but none
                     the less it follows virtue like a shadow.</p>

The brazen heaven he cannot ever scale (ὁ χάλκεος οὐρανὸς οὔ ποτ᾽ ἀμβατὸς αὐτῷ). He has reached the height of human felicity and cannot hope for more."

that the dead

                     admission of yours we find our chief solace in seasons
                     of longing and sorrow. For our own grief, and
                     grief felt on our account, we ought to bear in a
                     spirit of moderation, that we may not seem to be
                     lovers of self; it is a notion of unendurable torment
                     if we believe that those, of whom we have been
                     bereft, have some feeling of consciousness amid the
                     evils in which ordinary belief imagines them in-
                     volved. It has been my wish to root up this belief
                     from my mind and cast it out, and for that reason

                     You, too lengthy? Not to my thinking. During
                     the first part of what you said the effect was to
                     make me long for death, whilst the effect of the
                     latter part was sometimes to make me feel not
                     unwilling, sometimes feel untroubled; the net result
                     of all you said, however, is that I do not reckon
                     death among evils. M. Do we then require in
                     addition the epilogue usual with rhetoricians ? Or
                     has the time come for completely turning our backs
                     on rhetoric? A. Nay, do not you turn your back
                     on the art on which you have always brought
                     honour, and with good reason; for to tell the truth
                     it had first brought honour to you. But what is this

It is
                     a well-known tale: religious observance required that
                     on a fixed annual date of sacrifice she should be
                     drawn to the spot in a chariot, and it was some
                     distance from the town to the shrine; the animals
                     conveying her were lagging, whereupon the youths,
                     whom I named just now, stripped and anointed their
                     bodies with oil and took their place at the yoke.
                     In this way the priestess was conveyed to the shrine
                     and, according to the tale, as the car had been
                     drawn by her sons, she prayed the goddess to grant
                     them for their filial love the greatest boon that
                     could be bestowed on man by God; after they had
                     feasted with their mother the young men fell asleep
                     and in the morning were found dead.</p>

                  <p>It is said
                     Trophonius and Agamedes offered a similar prayer,
                     for after completing the building of the temple to
                     Apollo at Delphi they worshipped the god and asked
                     in return for their toil and the work they had
                     accomplished a recompense, no light one it is true,
                     nothing definite, but what was best for man. Apollo
                     made known to them that he would grant their
                     prayer the third ensuing day, and when it dawned
                     they were found dead. The god, they say, gave
                     definite judgment, and he was the god to whom the
                     rest of the gods had granted the gift of prophecy

                  <p>By quoting these and similar authorities rhetoricians
                     maintain that in this trial the immortal gods have
                     given their verdict by facts. Alcidamas, for instance,
                     an ancient rhetorician of the first distinction, actually
                     wrote an encomium on death which consists of a list
                     of the evils to which mankind are exposed; he has
                     failed to give those deeper arguments which the
                     philosophers bring together, but he has not failed
                     in wealth of eloquence. But noble deaths, sought
                     voluntarily, for the sake of country, are not only
                     commonly reckoned glorious by rhetoricians but also
                     happy. They go back to Erechtheus, whose daughters   <pb n="141"/> sought even with eagerness for death to save
                     the lives of their fellow-citizens; they give the tale
                     of Codrus who flung himself into the midst of the
                     enemy in the costume of a slave to avoid the re-
                     cognition, which would have ensued had he worn
                     the dress of a king, because of an oracle which said
                     that if the king should fall, Athens would be

                     Thebes, are much in evidence. Our Roman examples
                     they do not know of, and it would be an undertaking
                     to give the long roll of names: so numerous are

                     death, or at any rate cease to fear it. For if the
                     final day brings, not annihilation but a change of

I on the other hand, Brutus, think that for my part I “must” play the philosopher; for what can I busy myself with better, above all at a time when I have nothing to busy myself with? But not “a little way” as Neoptolemus said, for it is difficult to have a little knowledge in philosophy without having either a great deal or all that there is: for neither can a little be selected except from much nor, when a man has learnt a little, will he not also go on with the same eagerness to master what remains.</p>

however, as we remember, for we often heard him lecture, made a practice of teaching the rules of the rhetoricians at one time, and those of the philosophers at another. I was induced by our friends to follow this practice, and in my house at Tusculum I thus employed the time at our disposal.

There is nothing astonishing in that, for it shows the effect of philosophy: it is a physician of souls, takes away the load of empty troubles, sets us free from desires and banishes fears. But its influence cannot be the same for all its effect is great when it has secured a hold upon a character suited to it. For it is not only true that "fortune helps the brave," as the old proverb says, but philosophic thought does so in a far higher degree, and by its lessons strengthens as it were the quality of bravery. Nature clearly gave you at your birth a certain elevated and lofty spirit that looks down on things earthly, and so a speech delivered against death readily found a resting place in a brave soul. But can you think that these same arguments have real influence, apart from quite a few exceptions, with the very men by whom these arguments were discovered, reasoned out and committed to writing? How few philosophers are found to be so constituted and to have principles and a rule of life so firmly settled as reason requires! how few there are to think that the tenets of their school are not a display of knowledge but a law of life! to control themselves of their own will and obey their own dogmas!</p>

For just as a man who professed to be a grammarian and spoke like a barbarian, or a man who wished to be considered a musician and sang out of tune, would be all the more contemptible for failing in the very particular in which he claimed proficiency, so a philosopher who fails in the conduct of his life is the more contemptible in that his failure is in the duty of which he sets up to be a teacher, and, whilst professing an art of living, is at fault in his life.</p>
                  <p>V. A. Is it not therefore to be feared, if what you say is true, that you may be decking out philosophy in borrowed plumes? For what can be a stronger proof that she is of no assistance than that some finished philosophers live disgracefully? </p>

                  <p>M. That is in truth no proof at all: for just as all fields that are tilled are not productive, and the following lines of Accius are false:
                     Though into poorer soil good seed be sown
                     The crops are fine by their own nature grown,
                     so all characters when cultivated do not bear fruit. And, to keep to the same comparison, just as a field, however fertile, can produce no crop without cultivation, so the soul can produce none without teaching. So true is it that either is feeble without the other. Now the cultivation of the soul is philosophy: it pulls out vices by the roots and makes souls ready to receive the seed, and commits to them and, so to speak, sows in them what, when fully grown, may bear the most abundant fruit.</p>

What duty, what reputation, what glory will be of such value that the man who has once convinced himself that pain is the highest evil will be willing to seek to secure them at the cost of bodily pain? And further what shame, what degradation will a man not submit to in order to avoid pain, if he has once decided it to be the highest evil? Who moreover will not feel wretched, not merely at the moment that he is overtaken by attacks of extreme pain, if they involve the highest evil, but also when he is conscious that there is the prospect of pain?

For in one passage he asserts that if the wise man be burnt, if he be tortured—you are waiting perhaps for him to say, "he will submit, will endure, will not yield": high praise by Hercules and worthy of the great god Hercules whose name I invoked; but this is not enough for Epicurus, that hard stern spirit; if the wise man finds himself

who deny that pain is an evil do not generally go so far as to say that it is sweet to be tortured; they say that it is unpleasing, difficult, hateful, contrary to nature, and yet that it is not an evil: Epicurus, who says that pain is the only evil and the worst of all evils, thinks that the wise man will pronounce it sweet.</p>

They represent brave men wailing, they enervate our souls, and besides this they do it with such charm that they are not merely read, but learnt by heart.

XIX. Venit Epicurus, homo minime malus vel potius vir optimus: tantum monet, quantum intelligit: “Neglige” inquit “dolorem.” Quis hoc dicit? Idem qui dolorem summum malum. Vix satis constanter. Audiamus. “Si summus dolor est” inquit, “brevem necesse est esse.”

Non enim satis intelligo quid summum dicas esse, quid breve. “Summum, quo nihil sit superius: breve, quo nihil brevius. Contemno magnitudinem doloris, a qua me brevitas temporis vindicabit ante paene quam venerit.” Sed si est tantus dolor quantus Philoctetae? “Bene plane magnus mihi quidem videtur, sed tamen non summus: nihil enim dolet nisi pes possunt oculi: potest caput, latera, pulmones, possunt omnia: longe igitur abest a summo dolore.” “Ergo,” inquit “dolor diuturnus habet laetitiae plus quam molestiae.</p>

XIX. Epicurus steps forward,—in no sense an ill-meaning person, or rather a gentleman of the best intentions, he gives advice to the extent of his ability. “Ignore pain,” he says. Who says this? The same thinker who pronounces pain the highest evil. This is not quite consistent. Let us listen. “If pain is at its highest,” says he, “it must be short.”
“Repeat that once again to me!”<ref n="197.1">1</ref>
For I do not quite understand what you mean by “at its highest” and what you mean by “short.” “By ‘at the highest’ I mean that which has nothing higher; by ‘short’ I mean that which has nothing shorter. I scorn a degree of pain from which a brief space of time will deliver me almost before it has come.” But what if the pain be as severe as that of Philoctetes? “I admit it seems to me pretty severe, but all the same it is not at the highest; for his pain is only in the foot; there can be pain in the eyes, pain in the head, sides, lungs, pain everywhere. He is therefore far from suffering pain at the highest.” “Therefore,” says he, “continuous pain admits of more of gladness than of vexation.”<ref n="197.2">2</ref></p>

Will you, though you have seen boys in Lacedaemon, young men at Olympia, barbarians in the arena submitting to the heaviest blows and enduring them in silence—will you, if some pain happen to give you a twitch, cry out like a woman and not endure resolutely and calmly?—“It is unbearable; nature cannot put up with it.”—Very well. Boys endure from love of fame, others endure for shame's sake, many from fear, and yet are we afraid that nature cannot put up with what so many have endured in such a number of different places? Nature in fact not only puts up with but even demands it; for she offers nothing more excellent, nothing more desirable than honour, than renown, than distinction, than glory.

                  <p>XXI. When then we are directed to be masters of ourselves, the meaning of the direction is that reason should be a curb upon recklessness. As a rule, all men's minds contain naturally an element of weakness, despondency, servility, a kind of nervelessness and flaccidity. Had human nature nothing else, no creature would be more hideous than man; but reason, the mistress and queen of the world, stands close at hand and mounting by her own strength and pressing onward she becomes completed virtue. It is man's duty to enable reason to have rule over that part of the soul which ought to obey.</p>

Moreover this rule which is laid down for pain has a wider scope, for we must resist everything and not merely pain with a similar straining of every nerve of the soul. Anger blazes up, lust is roused: we must hasten for refuge to the same citadel, we must take up the same weapons; but as pain is our subject, let us leave other illustrations on one side. To enable us to bear pain quietly and calmly it is a very great gain to reflect with all our heart and mind, as the saying is, how honourable<ref n="213.2">2</ref> it is to do so. Nature has made us, as I have said before—it must often be repeated—enthusiastic seekers after honour, and once we have caught, as it were, some glimpse of its radiance, there is nothing we are not prepared to bear and go through in order to secure it. It is from this rush, this impulse of our souls towards true renown and reputation that the dangers of battle are encountered; brave men do not feel wounds in the line of battle, or feel them, but prefer death rather than move a step from the post that honour has appointed.</p>

In your case, however, should you become a figure in the eyes of the mob, I should nevertheless not like you to be dependent on their judgment, nor wish you to accept their view of what is fairest: you must use your own judgment; if you are content with yourself in approving the right, then you will not only win a victory over self, a rule I laid down a little while back, but over the world of men and things.</p>

We find accordingly some uncivilized barbarians able to fight desperately to the end with the sword but unable to behave like men in sickness. The Greeks on the other hand, who are not so very courageous but have a sufficiency of sense answering to their mental powers, cannot look an enemy in the face;<ref n="221.1">1</ref> and yet these same men show endurance and spirit, as human beings should, in bearing sickness, while the Cimbri and Celtiberians<ref n="221.2">2</ref> revel in battle and wail in sickness.

Reflect on these considerations, I pray, by day and night, for this principle will spread more widely in its application and cover a field a good deal larger than the consideration of pain alone; for if we are to do everything with the object of avoiding baseness and securing honour, we shall have the right of despising not merely the stings of pain but the bolts of fortune as well, especially</p>

For the soul which is suffering from some disease—now philosophers as I have said apply the term disease to these disordered movements —is no more in a sound condition than the body which is diseased. It follows that wisdom is a sound condition of the soul, unwisdom on the other hand a sort of unhealthiness which is unsoundness and also aberration of mind; and these attributes are much better connoted by the Latin terms than by the Greek, as will be found also in many other instances.<ref n="235.3">3</ref> But of that elsewhere; now for the business in hand.</p>

Consequently there is nothing better than the usage of the Latin language, where we say that those who are unbridled in the indulgence of either lust or wrath are beside themselves<ref n="237.2">2</ref> (though in fact wrath itself comes under the head of lust, for the definition of wrath is lust of vengeance).<ref n="237.3">3</ref> Those then who are described as beside themselves are so described because they are not under the control of mind to which the empire of the whole soul has been assigned by nature.

Be persuaded at any rate of this, that there will be no end to wretchedness unless the soul is cured, and without philosophy this is impossible. Therefore let us put ourselves in the hands of philosophy for treatment, since we have made a beginning: we shall be cured if we will.

It is therefore probable that the man who is susceptible of distress is also susceptible of fear, and indeed of dejection and depression of soul. Where men are susceptible of these emotions there also comes a feeling of subjection, a readiness to admit themselves beaten should occasion arise. He who makes this admission has to admit fear and cowardice as well. But of such feelings the brave man is not susceptible: therefore he is not susceptible of distress either.

If the temperate man performs his duties to men, he will also be just, and if he avoids and pursues the things he ought to, he will also be courageous. The “frugal” man, Cicero says, shows fortitude, justice and prudence. “Frugality” embraces these three and also has its own peculiar quality, therefore, says Cicero, “frugality” is left for the fourth virtue, temperance. But it cannot be said that his "therefore" is clear.

Virtue is the mean between two extremes, as for instance courage is the “mean” between rashness and cowardice, cf. § 74. The “mean” expresses the Greek notion of the beauty of virtue in its harmony and proportion rather than the absolute difference between right and wrong. But Aristotle said that in its essence virtue was an extreme utterly remote from vice. The difference between virtue and vice was not merely quantitative as Cicero seems to think the Peripatetics supposed.

For there are two proceeding from an idea of good, one of which is exuberant pleasure, that is to say, joy excited beyond measure by the idea of some great present good; the second is the intemperate longing for a supposed great good, and this longing is disobedient to reason, and may be rightly termed desire or lust.</p>

                  <p>Therefore these two classes, exuberant pleasure and lust springing from the idea of good, disturb the soul just as the two remaining, fear and distress, cause disturbances by the idea of evil. For fear is the idea of a serious threatening evil and distress is the idea of a serious present evil and indeed an idea freshly conceived of an evil of such sort that it seems a due reason for anguish; now that means that the man who feels the pain believes that he ought to feel pain. We must, however, with all our might and main resist these disturbances which folly looses and launches like a kind of evil spirit upon the life of mankind, if we wish to pass our allotted span in peace and quiet. But let us deal with the rest another time;<ref n="255.1">1</ref> for the present let us get rid of distress if we can.

For according to him evils are not lessened by duration nor lightened by previous consideration, and besides, he thinks it folly to dwell upon an evil which has still to come or maybe will not come at all; all evil, he says, is hateful enough when it has come; but the man, who is always thinking a mishap may come, is making that evil perpetual: but if it is not destined to come at all, he is needlessly the victim of a</p>

                  <p>Alleviation of distress, however, Epicurus finds in two directions, namely in calling the soul away from reflection upon vexation and in a “recall”<ref n="267.1">1</ref> to the consideration of pleasures. For he thinks the soul able to obey reason and follow its guidance. Reason therefore (in his view) forbids attention to vexations, withdraws the soul from morose reflections, blunts its keenness in dwelling upon wretchedness and, sounding a retreat from such thoughts, eagerly urges it on again to descry a variety of pleasures and engage in them with all the powers of the mind; and according to this philosopher the wise man's life is packed with the recollection of past and the prospect of future pleasures. This view we have stated in our usual style, the Epicureans state it in theirs. But let us look at their meaning; their style<ref n="267.2">2</ref> let us ignore.</p>

For there is nothing so well fitted to deaden and alleviate distress as the continual life-long reflection that there is no event which may not happen; nothing so serviceable as the consideration of our state as human beings, as the study of the law of our being and the practice of obedience to it; and the effect of this is not to make us always sad but to prevent us from being so at all.

For under the smart of circumstances which we regard as evil, concealment or forgetfulness is not within our control: circumstances tear us in pieces, worry and goad us; their touch is fiery; they do not allow us to breathe. And do you, Epicurus, bid me "forget," though to forget is contrary to nature, while you wrest from my grasp the aid which nature has supplied for the relief of long-standing pain? For there is a remedy, slow-working it is true but effectual, brought about by the long lapse of time. You bid me reflect on good, forget evil.

Are these your words or not? For instance, in that book which embraces all your teaching (for I shall now play the part of translator, that no one may think I am inventing) you say this: “For my part I find no meaning which I can attach to what is termed good, if I take away from it the pleasures obtained by taste, if I take away the pleasures which come from listening to music, if I take away too the charm derived by the eyes from the sight of figures in movement,<ref n="275.2">2</ref> or other pleasures produced by any of the senses in the whole man. Nor indeed is it possible to make such a statement as this—that it is joy of the mind which is alone to be reckoned as a good; for I understand by a mind in a state of joy, that it is so, when it has the hope of all the pleasures I have named—that is to say the hope that nature will be free to enjoy them without any blending of pain.”</p>

For we have on the tip of our tongues as a rule the words “nothing should seem unexpected.” But how will the burden of loss be more endurable for the man who has recognized that something of the kind must happen to a human being? For this way of speaking takes nothing from the actual sum of evil; all it does is to suggest that nothing has taken place which should not have been expected. And yet such a mode of speaking is not without effect in imparting comfort; I should rather be inclined to think it had very great effect. Therefore such things as are unexpected do not have enough influence to account for all distress that arises; for the shock they cause is perhaps heavier, but they do not make the occurrences seem more serious; they seem more serious because their impression is still fresh, not because of their suddenness.</p>

He said that this way of speaking had no bearing at all on the alleviation of distress; for he argued that the actual call to grief came from the fact that we were subject to a necessity so cruel. For Euripides' way of speaking was suited to bring comfort to ill-disposed people from the recital of the evils of others. My view, however, is far different. For the thought that the lot of man must be endured prevents us from contending as it were against God and also warns us that we are human: and this reflection is a great relief to sorrow, and the detailed instances cited are not given to delight the mind of the ill-natured, but to lead the mourner to think that he must bear the burdens which he sees many men have borne in a spirit of quiet restraint.</p>

                  <p>But there are more reasons than one for falling a victim to grief. First there is the belief already spoken of that a thing is evil, and at the sight of it and the conviction of its presence distress inevitably follows. Secondly men also think that by the intensity of their grief they are gratifying the dead. Add to these a certain womanish superstition; for they think they will more easily satisfy the immortal gods, if they admit that they are crushed and prostrated by an overwhelming blow. But the majority do not see how inconsistent these ideas are. For they praise those who, they think, meet death calmly; any who bear another's death with calmness they consider deserving of censure.

And yet it seems to me Cleanthes has not quite seen that the feeling of distress can sometimes arise from the very thing which he himself admits to be the worst evil of all. For what shall we say—seeing that Socrates, as we are told, convinced Alcibiades that he was in no true sense a man and that there was no difference, for all his high position, between him and any poor porter, whereupon Alcibiades was much distressed and implored Socrates with tears to teach him virtue and drive baseness away,—what shall we say, Cleanthes?

<note n="319.1">This story is not in Plato. It is given in Augustine C.D. XIV. 8. Socrates showed Alcibiades that he was wretched because of his folly. Alcibiades was distressed because he was not what he ought to have been, i.e. was base, which Cleanthes says is the worst of all evils. Cleanthes can only say that the "wise man "is free from evil and cannot feel distress or sorrow: Lyco says that distress is occasioned by trifles. What can either of them do for Alcibiades? Is his distress real or not? Is it or is it not due to "evil"? To St. Augustine it is sorrow (tristitia), akin to the "godly sorrow "of 2 Cor. 7. 10, cf. § 7.

Your statement referred to the wise man who cannot think that there is any evil where there is no disgrace, or else thinks the evil so insignificant that it is overwhelmed by wisdom and is scarcely visible; for the wise man does not call in any imaginary belief to buttress distress, or think it right to let himself be cruelly tortured and weakened by sorrow, as he thinks nothing can be more degraded. Nevertheless the course of our argument has shown, it appears to me, that though the actual question, whether anything was evil unless it could also be described as disgraceful, was not specifically put at the time—nevertheless, I say, we have come to see that, whatever evil there is in distress, it is not due to nature, but brought to a head by a judgment of the will and by mistaken belief.</p>

WHILE on many grounds, Brutus, I regard with a constant wonder the genius and virtues of our countrymen, I do so above all in those studies which at quite a late period became the object of their aspiration and were transferred to this State from Greece for though from the first beginnings of the city, the auspices, the religious rites, the assemblies of the people, the appeals, the Council of the Fathers, the distribution of horse and foot, and the whole military system had been established in an admirable way by the usages—to some extent too by the laws—prevalent under the Kings, later on, when once the commonwealth was set free from the tyranny of monarchy, a wonderful advance was made towards general excellence at a rate that surpasses belief. But this is by no means the place for me to speak of the customs and regulations of our ancestors and the direction and organization of the State; these things I have described with sufficient care in other places and in particular in the six books I have written upon the Commonwealth.</p>

This is not strange, for almost within sight of our ancestors Pythagoras, who was pre-eminent for the fame of his wisdom, lived in Italy at the same time that L. Brutus, the founder of your famous house, set his country free. Now, as the teaching of Pythagoras spread far and wide, it penetrated, as I think, into our State, and this, besides being likely as a conjecture, has also definite pieces of evidence in its favour. For as there were at that time great and powerful Greek cities in Italy, the district in which they flourished being called Magna Graecia, and as the name of Pythagoras himself and after him of the Pythagoreans had such remarkable influence in those cities, who can imagine that the ears of our countrymen were closed to the echo of their wisdom?</p>

                     <p>from intense meditation by the use of song and the music of the harp to calm their minds, Cato, a writer of great authority, has stated in his Origines<ref n="331.1">1</ref> that at banquets it was the custom of our ancestors for the guests at table to sing one after the other to the accompaniment of the flute in praise of the merits of illustrious men.

And it is by no means a proof of an uninstructed age that stringed instruments played a prelude at the festivals<ref n="331.3">3</ref> of the gods and the feasts of the magistrates: and this was a special feature of the Pythagorean training of which I am speaking. For my part too I think that the poem<ref n="331.4">4</ref> of Appius Caecus, which is highly praised by Panaetius in a certain letter addressed to Q. Tubero, was Pythagorean. In our ancient usages too there is much that has been taken over from the Pythagoreans, which I pass by, that it may not appear that we have learned from other sources the things we are thought to have discovered for ourselves.</p>

The study of wisdom, at any rate to the extent I have shown, was of long standing among our countrymen, but nevertheless I do not find any I can expressly call philosophers before the days of Laelius and Scipio. In their young days I see that Diogenes the Stoic and Carneades of the Academy were sent as ambassadors<ref n="333.1">1</ref> to the senate by the Athenians, and as these men had never taken any part in public life and one of them was a native of Cyrene and the other of Babylon, they would assuredly never have been called out of their lecture rooms or chosen for this office, unless the study of philosophy had been familiar to some of the leading Romans of that day. But though they committed other subjects to writing, some the rules of civil law, some their speeches, some the memorials of their ancestors, yet this the most fruitful of all arts, which teaches the way of right living, they promoted more by their lives than by their writings.</p>

They hold furthermore that there are divisions of disorder originating in two kinds of expected good and two of expected evil, with the result that there are four in all: lust and delight, in the sense of delight in present good and lust of future good, originate in what is good; fear and distress, they consider, originate in what is evil, fear in future and distress in present evil.

<note n="359.1">The meaning of this passage is difficult to follow. Cicero seems to be distinguishing between two states of moral defect, the one a "habit," the other a "disposition." Both are due to perversion of belief, but vicious "habit" means depravity, vicious " disposition means only inconsistency, sometimes more, sometimes less. A " disposition" by long indulgence can become a "habit." When Dr. Johnson was urged by Hannah More to take a little wine, "I can't take a little, child," he answered; "therefore I never touch it," for he did not intend the "disposition " to become a "habit." On the other hand Johnson declared himself" a hardened and shameless tea drinker," for "disposition" had been allowed to become "habit." Horace recognizes the distinction between the man who has the habit of vice and who rejoices in iniquity, and the man who has the "disposition to vice but is at war with himself, Sat. II. 7. 6: Pars hominum vitiis gaudet constanter et urget Propositum; pars multa natat, modo recta capessens, Interdum pravis obnoxia. cf. also Seneca Epist. Moral. 75.

Again, what of the contention of the same Peripatetics that these selfsame disorders which we think need extirpating are not only natural but also bestowed on us by nature for a useful end? This is the language they use. In the first place they praise irascibility<ref n="373.1">1</ref> at great length; they name it the whetstone of bravery and say that the assaults of angry men upon an enemy or disloyal citizen show greater vehemence; but that there is no substance in the petty logic of those who coldly argue like this: "It is right to fight this battle; it is proper to contend for laws, for liberty, for country;" that these words have no meaning unless bravery breaks out in a blaze of anger. And they do not argue about warriors only; no stern commands in time of need are given, they think, without something of the keen edge of irascibility. Finally they do not approve of an orator unless he uses the prickles of irascibility, not merely in bringing an accusation but even in conducting a defence, and though the anger be not genuine, yet it should, they think, be feigned in language and gesture, that the delivery of the orator may kindle the anger of the hearer. In fine they say that they do not regard anyone, who does not know how to be angry,</p>

<p>But fear, about which a few words must be said, is closely related to distress, which has been sufficiently discussed.

<p>Now so far we have dealt with belief of evil. Let us now deal with belief of good, that is, with delight and desire.

To think otherwise therefore is a deception to be removed, and a belief to be rejected, and just as where evil is expected the prospect must be met with endurance, so where good is expected the objects held to be momentous and delightful must be regarded in a calmer spirit. Besides there is this feature common to good and evil, that if it should be difficult at the moment to convince the sufferer that none of the things which disorder the soul is to be reckoned among good or evil, nevertheless different modes of treatment are applicable to different emotions, and the malicious must be reformed in one way, the rake in another, the worried again in another and the fearful in another.</p>

When this is realized, who is there to doubt that this movement too of the soul is wholly a matter of belief and will?

For, after death had been made of little account and pain alleviated so as to be endurable, we added the assuagement of distress, and man has no greater evil to cope with than distress. For although all distress of soul is burdensome and does not greatly differ from loss of mind, we are nevertheless accustomed to say in all the other cases where men are involved in some disorder either of fear or delight or desire, that they are merely agitated and disordered; but where they have surrendered themselves to distress we call them wretched, cast down, victims of trouble and ruin.</p>

All that she has given birth to, not merely living creatures but also what springs from the earth and has to support itself on its roots, she has willed to be perfect each after its kind. And so both trees and vines and plants that run along the ground and cannot lift themselves higher from the earth are some of them evergreen, others are stripped bare by winter and in the warmth of the springtime put forth leaves; nor is there any plant which fails, by the energy of a sort of inner movement and the power of the seeds enclosed in each of them, to put out in profusion either flowers or fruit or berries, while all of them are perfect in all things to the limit of their natures, if no outside force prevents.</p>

Moreover each kind holding fast to its own instinct, seeing that it cannot pass into the manner of living of a creature unlike itself, abides by the law of nature.

It is true they do, but they do not say that happy life is thereby fulfilled; the Peripatetics on the contrary think that without these things no life can be happy, or supposing it be happy, it certainly cannot be supremely happy. Now we wish it to be supremely happy and our view is confirmed by Socrates' well-known conclusion. For this was the way in which that leader of philosophy argued, that as was the disposition of each individual soul so was the man; and as was the man in himself so was his speech; moreover deeds resembled speech and life resembled deeds. Further the disposition of the soul in a good man is praiseworthy, and therefore the life of a good man is praiseworthy, and for that reason right, seeing that it is praiseworthy.

How beautiful the city, how richly provided with resources the State which he kept under the crushing weight of slavery! And yet we are told on the authority of trustworthy writers that while this man was exceedingly temperate in his way of life and showed untiring energy in the conduct of affairs, he was yet unscrupulous by nature and unjust and this means that in the eyes of all who have a clear insight into the truth he was necessarily supremely wretched. For he failed to secure the very objects of his covetous desires, even at the moment he thought that he could do all he wished.</p>

        <p>Although he came of good parentage and was born in a respectable position (though as to this different authorities have given different accounts<ref n="482.4">4</ref>) and although he had many friendly relations with contemporaries and enjoyed the intimacy of kinsfolk, and certain youths too were attached to him in the loverlike fashion recognized in Greece, he trusted none of them, but committed the care of his person to slaves whom he had selected from the households of wealthy men and whom he personally had relieved of the name that marked their servile 
             <pb n="485"/>
             condition, as well as to certain foreigners and uncivilized barbarians. In this way he had of his own choice, in order to gratify his unrighteous longing for despotism, almost shut himself up in prison. Nay too he went so far as to have his daughters taught the use of a razor that he might not put his neck at the mercy of a barber: accordingly the young princesses, reduced to the mean employment of drudges, shaved their father's hair and beard like miniature barbers; and all the same, when they were now older, he took the iron utensil out of the hands of these self-same girls and arranged for them to singe his hair and beard with red-hot walnut shells.</p>

      <div type="textpart" n="59" subtype="section">
        <p>He had two wives, Aristomache of his own city and Doris of Locris, but visited them by night, taking precautions to have a thorough inspection and examination everywhere before he came. And having surrounded the chamber in which he slept with a wide trench and fitted a gangway over the trench by means of a small wooden bridge, we are told that he raised this self-same bridge himself as often as he closed the door of the chamber.<ref n="485.1">1</ref> And as too he did not venture to appear upon the public platform for speakers he used to harangue the people from a lofty tower.</p>

        <p>Again, when he wanted to play at ball (for he was devoted to this pastime) and laid aside his undergarment, it is said that he handed his sword to a youngster of whom he was fond. Once when a certain acquaintance jestingly remarked, "Here at any rate is one to whom you certainly entrust your life," and the young man gave a smile, Dionysius had both executed, the one for having, as he held, pointed out the way to assassinate him, and the other for having greeted 
             <pb n="487"/>
             the remark with a smile; and the grief he felt for this act occasioned him greater distress than anything else in his life; for he had put to death the being he fondly loved. So true is it that the passions of ungovernable men are in continual conflict: satisfy one and you have to resist another.</p>
        <p>And yet this tyrant out of his own mouth passed judgment on the reality of his happiness. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="61" subtype="section">
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/> For when one of his flatterers, named Damocles, dilated in conversation upon his troops, his resources, the splendours of his despotism, the magnitude of his treasures, the stateliness of his palaces, and said that no one had ever been happier : "Would you then, Damocles," said he, "as this life of mine seems to you so delightful, like to have a taste of it yourself and make trial of my good fortune?" On his admitting his desire to do so Dionysius had him seated on a couch of gold covered with beautiful woven tapestries embroidered with magnificent designs, and had several sideboards set out with richly chased gold and silver plate. Next a table was brought and chosen boys of rare beauty were ordered to take their places and wait upon him with eyes fixed attentively upon his motions.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="62" subtype="section">
        <p>There were perfumes, garlands; incense was burnt; the tables were loaded with the choicest banquet: Damocles thought himself a lucky man. In the midst of all this display Dionysius had a gleaming sword, attached to a horse-hair, let down from the ceiling in such a way that it hung over the neck of this happy man. And so he had no eye either for those beautiful attendants, or the richly-wrought plate, nor did he reach out his hand to the table; presently the garlands slipped from their place of their own
             <pb n="489"/>
              accord; at length he besought the tyrant to let him go, as by now he was sure he had no wish to be happy. Dionysius seems (does he not?) to have avowed plainly that there was no happiness for the man who was perpetually menaced by some alarm. Moreover it was not even open to him to retrace his steps to the path of justice, to restore to his fellow citizens their freedom and their rights; for with the inconsiderateness of youth he had entangled himself in such errors and been guilty of such acts as made it impossible for him to be safe if he once began to be sane.</p>

        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/> While, however, he had a lively fear of the disloyalty of friends, how deeply he felt the need of them he disclosed in the affair of the two Pythagoreans,<ref n="488.1">1</ref> one of whom he had accepted as surety for sentence of death, while the other had presented himself at the hour appointed for execution to discharge the surety: "Would," said he, "that I could be enrolled as a third in your friendship!" How wretched it was for him to cut himself off from the intimacy of friendship, from the enjoyment of social life, from any freedom of intercourse at all! particularly in the case of a man who had received instruction from childhood and was trained in the liberal arts. He was in fact we hear an enthusiastic musician, a tragic poet too-how good, matters little ; for in this art, more than in others, it somehow happens that everyone finds his own work excellent; so far I have never known the poet (and I have been friends with Aquinius<ref n="488.2">2</ref>) who did not think himself the best; this is the way with them-"You are charmed with your work, I with mine"-but to come back to Dionysius, he denied himself all the 
             <pb n="491"/>
             spiritual enjoyment of civilized life; he associated with runaways, with criminals, with barbarians: he regarded no man who either felt worthy of freedom or had any wish at all to be free as a friend.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="64" subtype="section">
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/> With the life of such a man, and I can imagine nothing more horrible, wretched and abominable, I shall not indeed compare the life of Plato or Archytas,<ref n="491.1">1</ref> men of learning and true sages: I shall call up from the dust on which he drew his figures an obscure, insignificant person belonging to the same city, who lived many years after, Archimedes.<ref n="491.2">2</ref> When I was quaestor<ref n="491.3">3</ref> I tracked out his grave, which was unknown to the Syracusans (as they totally denied its existence), and found it enclosed all round and covered with brambles and thickets; for I remembered certain doggerel lines inscribed, as I had heard, upon his tomb, which stated that a sphere along with a cylinder had been set up on the top of his grave. Accordingly, after taking a good look all round (for there are a great quantity of graves at the Agrigentine Gate),</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="65" subtype="section">
        <p>I noticed a small column rising a little above the bushes, on which there was the figure of a sphere and a cylinder.

             with about half the lines legible, as the latter portion was worn away. So you see, one of the most famous cities of Greece, once indeed a great school of learning as well, would have been ignorant of the tomb of its one most ingenious citizen, had not a man of Arpinum<ref n="492.1">1</ref> pointed it out. But to come back to the point where I made this digression. Who in all the world, who enjoys merely some degree of communion with the Muses, that is to say with liberal education and refinement, is there who would not choose to be the mathematician rather than the tyrant? If we inquire into their manner of life and employment we see that the mind of the one found its sustenance in the problems of scientific research and enjoyed the exercise of its ingenuity—and this is the one most delightful spiritual food-whilst the mind of the other dwelt on murder and outrage, and fear was in its company both by day and night. Come, compare Democritus, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras with Dionysius; what thrones, what resources will you put above the studies in which they found their delight?</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="67" subtype="section">
        <p>For that "best" of which you are in search must necessarily have its place in what is the best part in a man.<ref n="492.2">2</ref> But what is there in man better than a mind that is sagacious and good? The good of such a mind then we must enjoy if we wish to be happy; but the good of the mind is virtue: therefore happy life is necessarily bound up with virtue. Consequently all that is lovely, honourable, of good report,<ref n="493.3">3</ref> as I have said above,<ref n="493.4">4</ref> but I must say it again, it seems, with rather more expansion, is full of joys; but seeing that it is clear that happy life is made up of joys that are lasting and complete,</p>

Let us assume a man pre-eminently endowed with the highest qualities and let our imagination play for a moment with the picture. In the first place he must be of outstanding intelligence; for virtue is not easily found to go with sluggish minds; secondly he must have an eager enthusiasm in the quest of truth; and from this springs the famous threefold progeny of the soul:<ref n="495.2">2</ref> one centred in the knowledge of the universe and the disentanglement of the secrets of nature; the second in distinguishing the things that should be sought out or avoided and in framing a rule of life; the third in judging what is the consequence to every premise, what is incompatible with it, and in this lies all refinement of argument and truth of judgment.</p>

For meditation upon the power and nature of the gods of itself kindles the desire of attaining an immortality that resembles theirs, nor does the soul think that it is limited to this short span of life, when it sees that the causes of things are linked one to another in an inevitable chain, and nevertheless their succession from eternity to eternity is governed  <pb n="499"/> by reason and intelligence.</p>

Add to this the fruit which springs from friendships<ref n="499.5">5</ref> in which learned men find the counsel which shares their thoughts and almost breathes the same breath throughout the course of life, as well as the supreme charm of daily social intercourse. What, pray, does  <pb n="501"/> such a life require to make it happier? And to a life filled with joys so abundant and intense, fortune itself is bound to yield its place.

Shall we allow this man, whose judgment differs but little from the instinct of the beasts, to be forgetful of himself and be disdainful of fortune at the moment when all that he holds good and evil is at fortune's disposal; to say that he is happy in the extremity of torture and upon the rack at the moment when he has laid down that not only is pain the worst of evils but is the only one as well?</p>

        <p>For it is characteristic of the wise man to do nothing of which he can repent, nothing against his will, to do everything nobly, consistently, soberly, rightly, not to look forward to anything as if it were bound to come, to be astonished at no occurrence under the impression that its occurrence is unexpected and strange, to bring all things to the standard of his own judgment, to abide by his own decisions. And what can be happier than this I certainly cannot conceive.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="82" subtype="section">
        <p>For the Stoics indeed the conclusion is easy, since they hold it the sovereign good to live according to nature and in harmony with nature, seeing that not only is this the wise man's settled duty but also it lies in his power, and so for them it follows necessarily that where a man has the chief good in his power, he also has the power of happy life: thus the life of the wise is rendered happy always. Now you know the utterances I think the most courageous about happy life and, at the point we now are unless you have something better to suggest—the truest as well.</p>
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/> A. I have no better suggestion to offer for my part, but there is a favour I should like to obtain from you, if it is not troublesome (seeing that you are not hampered by being tied to any definite school of thought, and taste from all of them everything that strikes you most as having the semblance of truth),<ref n="509.1">1</ref> as a little while back you appeared to be urging the Peripatetics and the Old Academy to have the courage to say freely without reservation that wise men were always supremely happy, this is what I should like to hear, how you think it is consistent for them to say so; <pb n="511"/> for you have said a good deal in opposition to the opinion they hold<ref n="511.1">1</ref> by adopting the conclusions of the Stoic reasoning. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="83" subtype="section">
        <p>M. Let me then use the freedom allowed to my school of philosophic thought alone, which decides nothing on its own pronouncement but ranges over the whole field,<ref n="511.2">2</ref> in order that the question may be decided by others on its own merits, without invoking anyone's authority. And since it appears that what you wish established is that, whatever the views held by warring sects about the limits<ref n="511.3">3</ref> of good and evil, nevertheless virtue is sufficient security for a happy life, a proposition which Carneades we are told habitually discussed<ref n="511.4">4</ref>-but he did so heatedly, as was his way in opposing the Stoics whom he was always most eager to refute, and against whose teaching his temper had fired up-for my part I shall treat the question calmly. For if the Stoics have rightly fixed the limits of the good, the question is settled: it follows of necessity that the wise man is always happy.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="84" subtype="section">
        <p>But let us inquire, if possible, into each single opinion of the remaining schools of thought, that so this noble dogma, as it were, of happy life, can fit in with the views and teaching of them all.<ref n="511.5">5</ref></p>
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/> Now these in my opinion are the views about "limits" still maintained and supported. First four simple ones: that nothing is good unless it is morally right, as the Stoics say; no good except pleasure, as Epicurus; no good except absence of pain, as Hieronymus ; no good except enjoyment of the first goods of nature, either all or the chief of them, as Carneades argued against the Stoics.</p>

        <p>These then are the simple; the next are composite : three kinds of good, the highest of the soul, second of the body, third from the outside, as the Peripatetics,<ref n="513.3">3</ref> and the Old Academy are much the same ; Dinomachus and Callipho<ref n="513.4">4</ref> have coupled pleasure with rectitude; the Peripatetic Diodorus<ref n="513.5">5</ref> has joined, however, freedom from pain to rectitude. These are the views which have some solid support; for those of Aristo, Pyrrho, Herillus<ref n="513.6">6</ref> and some others have melted into air. Let us see what these can do for us, leaving on one side the Stoics whose view I think I have supported sufficiently already. And besides them the Peripatetic case is cleared up: apart from Theophrastus<ref n="513.7">7</ref> and any who follow him in a feeble dread and abhorrence of pain, it is allowable for the rest of them at any rate to do as they usually do, that is to say, exalt the dignity and grandeur of virtue. And when they have raised it to the heavens, in the way habitual to men who have a fine flow of eloquence, it is easy to trample all else under foot and despise it in comparison with virtue; for it is not allowable for men who say that renown must be sought at the cost of pain to deny that those who had attained their aim are happy; for though they are involved in certain evils, yet this term of happiness has a wide and far-reaching meaning.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="86" subtype="section">
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/> For as commerce is termed profitable and <pb n="515"/> farming productive, not if the one always escapes all loss, the other always escapes all damage from bad weather, but if in the main there is in each a good margin of prosperity; so life can be termed happy, not only if it is brimful of good things of every sort, but if in the main and on the weightier side there is a marked preponderance of good.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="87" subtype="section">
        <p>Therefore by the reasoning of these philosophers<ref n="515.1">1</ref> happy life will follow virtue even to torture and in its company pass down into the bull,<ref n="515.2">2</ref> on the authority of Aristotle, Xenocrates, Speusippus, Polemo,<ref n="515.3">3</ref> and threats and bribes will not pervert it to abandon virtue. The opinion of Callipho and Diodorus will be the same, both of whom so warmly espouse rectitude that all things that have not got it must, they hold, be ranked a long way behind it. The rest do seem to be in somewhat of a strait, still they manage to swim their way out-Epicurus, Hieronymus, and any who are found to care to support poor deserted Carneades. For there is none of them who does not regard the soul as judge of the true good and join in instructing it to be able to despise such things as have only the semblance of good or evil.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="88" subtype="section">
        <p>For what you hold to be the case of Epicurus, will also be the case of Hieronymus and Carneades and, upon my word, of all the rest of them; for who of them is insufficiently provided against death or pain? Let us begin, if you will, with the man we name effeminate,<ref n="515.4">4</ref> name a voluptuary. Well, do you think him afraid of death or pain? He calls the day of his death happy and in the sufferings of acute pains he represses those very pains by the living remembrance of his discoveries.</p>

<p>There is a passage in Heraclitus,<ref n="530.3">3</ref> the natural philosopher, relating to
Hermodorus,<ref n="531.4">4</ref> the leading citizen of Ephesus, where he
says that the whole body of the Ephesians ought
to be put to death, because, when they drove
Hermodorus out of their community, they used this
language: "Let no single man among us distinguish
himself above the rest; but if any such appear let
him live elsewhere and amongst other men."<ref n="531.5">5</ref> Is
this feeling not prevalent with every people? Do
not men hate all superiority of virtue ? What about
Aristides (for I prefer to take Greek instances rather
than Roman)—was he not banished from his country
because he was too just? What vexations therefore
they escape who have no dealings whatever with the
people! For what is more delightful than leisure
devoted to literature? That literature I mean
which gives us the knowledge of the infinite greatness of nature, and, in this actual world of ours, of
the sky, the lands, the seas.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="106" subtype="section">
<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
<p>Now when distinction is despised,
money also despised, what is there left to be dreaded? Exile, I suppose, which is reckoned
among the greatest evils. If it is an evil because
popularity is impaired and lost, it was explained a
little while back how despicable a thing that is; but
if it is wretched to be separated from one's country,
our provinces are full of wretched beings, very few
of whom return to their country. “But exiles have
their property confiscated."</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="107" subtype="section">
<pb n="533"/>
<p>What of that? Is
there not sufficient said about the endurance of
poverty? In fact if we now inquire into the real
meaning of exile, not the disgrace of the name, how
far, pray, does it differ from continual residence
abroad? And in that the noblest philosophers have
spent their lives, Xenocrates, Crantor, Arcesilas,
Lacydes, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Zeno, Cleanthes,
Chrysippus, Antipater, Carneades, Clitomachus,
Philo, Antiochus, Panaetius, Posidonius, countless
others who, once departed, never returned home.<ref n="533.1">1</ref>
“Yes, but without disgrace.” Can exile bring disgrace upon the wise man? For the wise man is our
subject throughout, and such a blot he could not
justly incur;</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="108" subtype="section">
<p>for we are not called upon to comfort
the exile whose sentence is just. Finally in facing
all mischances the easiest is the method of those
who refer the aims they follow in life to the standard
of pleasure, and this means that they can live happily
wherever this is provided. And so Teucer's saying
can be fitted to every condition :</p>
<p>"One's country is wherever one does well."<ref n="533.2">2</ref></p>
<p>Socrates, for instance, on being asked to what country
he claimed to belong, said, "To the world;"<ref n="535.1">1</ref></p>
<pb n="535"/>
<p>for he
regarded himself as a native and citizen of the world.
What of T. Albucius?<ref n="534.2">2</ref> Did he not study philosophy
at Athens with complete tranquillity in exile? Yet
that is the very thing which would not have happened
to him if in obedience to the rule of Epicurus<ref n="534.3">3</ref> he
had taken no part in public affairs.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="109" subtype="section">
<p>For<ref n="534.4">4</ref> how was
Epicurus happier for living in his country than
Metrodorus<ref n="534.5">5</ref> for living at Athens? Or did Plato
get the better of Xenocrates<ref n="534.6">6</ref> or Polemo of Arcesilas
in point of happiness? What value indeed can be
attached to the sort of community from which the wise
and good are driven away? Damaratus for instance,
the father of our King Tarquin, left Corinth because
he could not endure the tyranny of Cypselus,<ref n="534.7">7</ref> and
fled to Tarquinii, where he set up house and begat
children. Surely it was not foolish of him to prefer
the freedom of exile to slavery at home?</p>

<p>Then again, emotions of the soul,
anxieties and distresses are alleviated by forgetfulness when the thoughts of the soul are diverted to
pleasure.<ref n="535.8">8</ref> Not without reason therefore Epicurus
ventured to say that the wise man always has more
of good than evil because he always has pleasures;
and from this he thinks there follows the conclusion
we are in quest of, that the wise man is always
happy.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="111" subtype="section">
<p>"Even if he is to be without sense of sight,
of hearing?" Even then; for he despises such
things in themselves. For to begin with, what
pleasures, pray, does the blindness you dread so
much have to go without? seeing that some even
argue that all the other pleasures reside in the
actual sensations, while the perceptions of sight
<pb n="537"/>
do not go along with any delight felt in the eyes,</p>

<p>in the same way as the perceptions of taste, smell,
touch, hearing are confined to the actual organ of
sensation: nothing of the sort takes place with the
eyes it is the soul which receives the objects
we see. Now the soul may have delight in many
different ways, even without the use of sight; for
I am speaking of an educated and instructed man
with whom life is thought; and the thought of
the wise man scarcely ever calls in the support of
the eyes to aid his researches.<ref n="537.1">1</ref></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="112" subtype="section">
<p>For if night does not
put a stop to happy life why should a day that
resembles night stop it? For the remark of the
Cyrenaic Antipater is, it is true, a bit coarse, but its
purport is not pointless; when his womenfolk were
bemoaning his blindness, "What is the matter?"
he said: "is it that you think there is no pleasure
in the night?" That famous old worthy, Appius,<ref n="536.2">2</ref>
for example, who was blind for a number of years,
was, as we gather both from the posts he filled and
the business he transacted, in no way unfitted by his
misfortune for his duties whether private or public.
C. Drusus,<ref n="536.3">3</ref> we are told, had his house continually
filled by clients unable to see for themselves their
way to settle their rights and ready to call in a
blind man to guide them. In my childhood Cn.
Aufidius the ex-praetor both stated his views in the
senate and aided his friends in their consultations,
and wrote history in Greek and, in literature, had a
seeing eye.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="113" subtype="section">
<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
<p>The Stoic Diodotus, who was blind,
lived for many years at my house. Now
whilst a thing scarcely credible-he occupied
himself with philosophical study even far more un-
tiringly than he did previously, and played upon the
<pb n="539"/>
harp in the fashion of the Pythagoreans, and had
books read aloud to him by night and day, in the
study of which he had no need of eyes, he also did
what seems scarcely possible without eyesight, he
went on teaching geometry, giving his pupils verbal
directions from and to what point to draw each line.</p>

<p>It is related that Asclepiades,<ref n="538.1">1</ref> no obscure follower
of the Eretrian school, on being asked by someone
what blindness had brought him, answered that he
had one more boy in his retinue;<ref n="538.2">2</ref> for just as the
most utter poverty would be endurable if we could
bring ourselves to do as certain Greeks do daily,<ref n="538.3">3</ref>
so blindness could readily be borne, should we
be supplied with aids to our infirmities.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="114" subtype="section">
<p>When
Democritus<ref n="538.4">4</ref> lost his sight he could not, to be sure,
distinguish black from white: but all the same he
could distinguish good from bad, just from unjust,
honourable from disgraceful, expedient from in-
expedient, great from small, and it was permitted
him to live happily without seeing changes of colour;
it was not permissible to do so without true ideas.
And this man believed that the sight of the eyes
was an obstacle to the piercing vision of the soul
and, whilst others often failed to see what lay at
their feet, he ranged freely into the infinite without
finding any boundary that brought him to a halt.
There is the tradition also that Homer was blind :
but it is his painting not his poetry that we see ;<ref n="539.5">5</ref>
what district, what shore, what spot in Greece,
what aspect or form of combat, what marshalling
of battle, what tugging at the oar, what movements
of men, of animals has he not depicted so vividly
that he has made us see, as we read, the things
which he himself did not see?</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="115" subtype="section">
<pb n="541"/>
<p>What then? Do
we think either that Homer failed to feel delight
of soul and pleasure, or that any learned man ever
did so? Or if this were not true, would Anaxagoras<ref n="541.1">1</ref>
<note n="541.1">cf. I. § 104.
</note>

or Democritus himself, whom we have named, have
left the fields they inherited, would they have given
themselves up entirely to this divine delight of
learning and discovery? And so the augur Tiresias,<ref n="541.2">2</ref>
<note n="541.2">The blind prophet of ancient Thebes.
</note>

whom the poets represent as wise, is never introduced as bemoaning his blindness. But on the
other hand Homer, having represented Polyphemus
as a savage monster, depicts him also as conversing
with a ram and congratulating it on its good fortune
in being able to walk where it would and reach
what it would.<ref n="541.3">3</ref> The poet was right; for the Cyclops
himself had no more sense than the ram.</p>

<p>Is there
any evil really in deafness? Marcus
Crassus was half-deaf; still he suffered another
worse annoyance, in hearing himself spoken ill of,
even if, as I thought at the time, it was unjustly.
Our countrymen do not as a rule know Greek nor
the Greeks Latin: therefore we in their tongue and
they in ours are deaf, and all of us as well are
assuredly deaf in those languages, countless in
number, which we do not understand.
"But the
deaf do not hear the voice of a good singer." No,
nor the screech of a saw either, when it is being
sharpened, nor the grunting of a pig when its throat
is being cut, nor the thunder of the roaring sea
when they want to sleep. And if, may be, music
has charms for them, they should first reflect that
<pb n="543"/>
many wise men lived happily before music was
invented, secondly that far greater pleasure can be
derived from reading than hearing verse.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="117" subtype="section">

<p>Next,
as a little while ago we diverted the blind to the
pleasure of hearing, so we may divert the deaf to
the pleasure of sight; for the man who can converse
with himself will not need the conversation of
another.</p>
<p>Let everything be piled up on one single man so
that he loses together sight and hearing, suffers too
the most acute bodily pains; and these in the first
place commonly finish a man of themselves alone:
but if, maybe, they are indefinitely prolonged and
torture him notwithstanding more violently than he
sees reason for enduring, what reason have we,
gracious heaven, for continuing to suffer? For
there is a haven close at hand, since death is at
the same time an eternal refuge where nothing
is felt. Theodorus said to Lysimachus when he
threatened him with death, "A great achievement
indeed of yours if you have got the power of a
blister-beetle."<ref n="543.1">1</ref> </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="118" subtype="section">
<p>When Perses begged not to be
led in triumph, Paullus replied, "That is a thing you
can settle." Much was said about death the first
day, when we inquired into the nature of death;
a good deal on the next day when pain was being
discussed, and he who remembers it surely runs no
risk of thinking either that death is not to be wished
for or at any rate that it is to be feared.</p>
