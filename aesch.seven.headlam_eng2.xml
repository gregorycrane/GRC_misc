<head>THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES</head>
<stage>
  <p>Scene: The Acropolis of Thebes (v. 226).</p>
  <p>Time: The morning of the day on which the seven champions of the besieging Argive army have resolved on an assault.</p>
  <p>ETEOCLES, the present ruler of Thebes, whilst awaiting the return of the messenger he has sent out to reconnoitre, addresses an assemblage of Theban citizens.</p>
</stage>
<sp>
  <speaker start-line="1" end-line="38">ETEOCLES</speaker>
  <p>Citizens of Cadmus, it is fitting that whosoe'er at the helm of the [ship of] State watches over affairs, managing the rudder without closing his eyelids in slumber, should speak as the occasion demands. For if we should meet with success, the cause of it would be [put to the credit] of Heaven; but if on the contrary—which may God forbid—disaster should occur, Eteocles alone would be much bruited up and down the city by the townsmen at the beginning of many a murmuring speech and lamentation; of which may Zeus prove to the Cadmean city rightly named Averter.</p>
  <p>You it now behoves—both him that yet falls short of <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="10"/> manhood's prime, and him that is past it but yet keeps up a vigorous growth of body, and (as is only right) each one of
  <pb n="78"/>
  the age for military service,<ref n="78.1">1</ref>—to succour his city and the altars of his ancestral gods, so that their worship be not ever destroyed, and his children, and the earth his mother, kindliest nurse; for she, taking upon herself all the cumber of their nurture, reared up young creatures moving on her genial plain to be a shield-bearing people, that ye might prove yourselves worthy of trust at the present need.</p>
  <p><milestone unit="marginlnum" n="20"/> So now until to-day Heaven inclines in our favour; for during all this time [the fortune of] war has mostly gone well for the besieged; but now, as declares the seer, the feeder of birds who by ear and judgment, without the aid of fire, revolves [the import of] birds of omen with unerring art—he who is master of that kind of divination tells us that an Achaean attack, greater than any yet, is being discussed in the night and that they will plan an assault upon the city.</p>
  <p>Come, hasten all ye to the battlements and to the gates of <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="30"/> the defences! Make speed equipped in full armour, man the breast-works, and, taking each his station on the platforms of the towers, stand fast and be of good courage; nor tremble over-much at the crowd of aliens. Heaven will guide aright the issue. I for my part, also, sent out scouts and observers of their host, who are, I am confident, on no useless errand ; and, when I hear their report, I shall in no wise be caught by stratagem.</p>

  <p>Eteocles, most noble prince of the Cadmeans, <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="40"/> I am returned bringing clear tidings of what is going forward yonder in the host; and am myself eye-witness of the facts. Seven warriors, gallant captains, having cut a bull's throat over a shield inlaid with metal<ref n="78.2">2</ref> and touching with their
  <pb n="79"/>
  hands the bull's blood, called to witness Ares, and Enyo, and Terror that rejoiceth in slaughter, that, either they would sack the citadel of the Cadmeans bringing destruction upon it by force of arms, or in death would mingle their blood with this soil. And memorials of themselves, destined for their homes, were they hanging for their parents upon the <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="50"/> chariot of Adrastos, shedding tears—though no sound of complaint was on their lips; for a spirit of iron determination as of lions with battle in their eyes was inspiring them, kindling them with valour. And of this the report is not delayed by interval of time; for I left them in the act of drawing lots as to how each of them, receiving his post by the lot, should lead his company against our gates. Therefore do thou marshal with speed our chosen bravest warriors at the exits of the city-gates. For already nigh at hand the Argive army in full array is advancing, is raising the dust, and white foam from their horses' lungs is marking the <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="60"/> plain with spots. Do thou, like a good ship's-helmsman, secure the citadel before the blast of war rushes down; for the surge of their host is roaring over the land. So do thou in respect of this seize occasion, as may be most rapid. I too, for what remains, will keep a trusty eye on the watch all day, and thou by knowledge from clear report of what goes on without the gates shalt be safe from harm.</p>

  <p>I cry aloud for great and terrifying woes! The army is let loose, and has left its camp. Yonder is streaming a mass of mounted folk in advance. Dust high in air, <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="80"/> messenger though voiceless yet clear and true, convinces me. The rattle of shields stuns me,<ref n="80.1">1</ref> . . the noise of arms upon the plain . .. wings its way with a din that sounds in my ears, and roars like a resistless torrent dashing down a mountain side. (O gods and goddesses, avert the rising evil!) With a shout that comes over the walls the argent-shielded folk are on the move, pressing forward in orderly array against the city. Who then shall rescue us? <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="90"/> Who of the gods or goddesses will come to our aid? Shall I prostrate myself before the images of the divinities? (O happy Ones securely established!) 'Tis full time to cling to the images. What linger we bewailing? Hear ye, or hear ye not the noise of shields? When, if not now, shall we busy ourselves with suppliant rites<ref n="80.2">2</ref> of peplus and of garland? I perceive a clattering. That was never the clash of a single spear! What wilt thou do? wilt thou <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="100"/> desert thine own city, O Ares, old inhabitant of the land? O God of the golden helm, look thou, look thou upon the city which once thou didst hold dear.<ref n="80.3">3</ref></p>
  <p>Ye gods, who guard our land, come all ye to us: look upon a company of maidens who beseech ye in dread of slavery. For around the city, gathered by the blasts of <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="110"/>
  <pb n="81"/>
  war, a wave of slanting-crested warriors is dashing,—O Zeus, father all-accomplishing, save us from capture by the foemen and the Argives are encompassing the citadel of Cadmus, and there is a clangour<ref n="81.1">1</ref> of martial weapons, aye, and in the horses' mouths bridles are rattling in deadly chorus. And seven leaders, conspicuous in the host for their lancer's harness, are standing hard by our seventh gate, having received their posts by lot.</p>
  <p>And thou, O Pallas, Zeus-born Power that loves the fray, <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="120"/> do thou prove thyself deliverer of our city; and thou, Poseidon, steeded monarch who rulest the ocean with fish-spearing trident, grant release from our terrors. And thou, O Ares, (alas, alas !), do thou protect the city named from Cadmus, and manifest thyself her guardian kinsman. And thou, O Aphrodite, do thou as befits the ancestress of our race keep back the foe for of thy blood are we sprung : crying aloud<ref n="81.2">2</ref> we approach thee with prayers to thy god-<milestone unit="marginlnum" n="130"/>head. And thou, O Lycian king, prove thyself a very wolf to the hostile army, [in response] to the voice of our sighings. And thou, O virgin daughter of Latona, do thou make ready thy bow.</p>
  <p>Ah me, ah me! I hear a din of chariots round about the city, (O queen Hera !) the axle-boxes of weighed-down axles scream,<ref n="81.3">3</ref> (O Artemis beloved!) ah me, ah me! and the air a-quiver with spears is in a frenzy. What is our city <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="140"/> undergoing? What will become of it? Whither will Heaven yet direct the issue?</p>
  <p>Ah me, ah me! A shower of stones is coming upon the battlements struck from afar, (O Apollo beloved!) there is a clatter at the gates of brass-bound shields—child of Zeus,
  <pb n="82"/>
  from whom comes<ref n="82.1">1</ref> the sacred decision ending the strife in battle, and thou, O Onca, blest queen established before our city, come to the rescue of our seven-gated town.</p>
  <p>O divinities all-sufficing, O ye perfect guardian gods and goddesses of this land's defences, betray not the war-wearied town to an army of outlandish speech,—Hear ye, hear fully <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="150"/> the prayers of maidens which they offer with outstretched hands—</p>
  <p>But,<ref n="82.2">2</ref> O divinities beloved, encompassing the city as its deliverers show yourselves friendly to it. Take thought of <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="160"/> the ceremonies publicly performed, and taking thought of them protect them. Aye, and be ye mindful, I pray, of the city-festivals with abundant sacrifice.</p>

<sp><speaker start-line="362" end-line="383">MESSENGER</speaker><p>I can tell from full observation the doings of our opponents, and how each has drawn his allotted station at our gates. Tydeus already at the gate of Prœtus is fretting —yet the seer forbids him to cross the Ismenus, since the sacrifices are not propitious. But Tydeus in wild excitement and eager for the fray is uttering sounds like hissings of a snake in the mid-day heat; and assails with taunts the seer, wise Œcleides, that 'out of cowardice he is shrinking <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="370"/> before [the approach of] death and battle.' Shouting such words, he shakes three overshadowing crests, the hairy plume of his helmet; and from beneath his shield bells of wrought brass are making a terrifying din. And upon his shield he bears a vaunting device as follows—a sky fashioned ablaze with stars; and in the middle of the shield a brilliant full moon, most august of the stars, the eye of Night, stands out conspicuous. In such wild exultation, with armour of boastful device, he is shouting on the river-bank; longing for the combat, like a horse fighting against the bit in his impatience who chafes as he hears<ref n="88.2">2</ref> the trumpet-call. Whom <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="380"/> wilt thou station to oppose this champion? Who, when the bolts of the gate of Prœtus are withdrawn, can be trusted to defend it?</p></sp>

Now against Tydeus I will station the brave son of Astacus here, as defender of the gate,—a man of right noble birth who worships the throne of Honour and detests arrogant speech; for idle in mean actions, but no coward, is he wont to be; and from the Sown Heroes, they whom Ares spared, his stock is sprung, and truly a native of this soil is he,—Melanippus. <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="400"/> The issue will Ares with his dice determine.

But at the Electran gate Capaneus is stationed by lot; a <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="410"/> giant this man—taller than the one before mentioned;—and his boasting words betoken thoughts unsuited to a mortal, and he threatens terrible things (which may the gods not bring to pass!) against our defences; for he declares that, whether Heaven wills it or wills it not, he will sack our town, and not even the wrath of Zeus striking down upon the plain in his path shall restrain him. Lightning flashes and thunderbolts he compares to the warmth of the noon-tide sun. And he bears for device a naked man carrying fire, and a torch ready for action is blazing in his hands; <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="420"/> and in letters of gold he announces, 'I will burn the city.'

The third for whom the lot leapt forth from the upturned helm was Eteoclus, that he should lead his company against the gate of Neïs.

And his shield is blazoned in no mean style:—a man in armour is ascending the steps of a scaling-ladder to an enemy's tower, seeking to storm it. And this one too in a

<sp><speaker start-line="473" end-line="487">MESSENGER</speaker><p>Another, fourth in order, having as his post the neighbouring gate of Onca Athena, is taking station by it with a shout, the form and mighty bulk of Hippomedon.

And Hyperbius, stout son of Oenops, has been chosen as a champion against yon champion, willing enough to discover what fate [he may expect] of Fortune<ref n="92.1">1</ref> in time of need,—a man not to be despised either in form or spirit or in the fashion of his equipment. And with good reason did Hermes pair them; for hostile is our hero to the champion with whom he will engage, and they twain will bring into conflict gods [depicted] on their shields who are hostile to each other. For the one bears [as device] fire-breathing Typhon, and Hyperbius has father Zeus, standing upright, planted upon the shield, making his thunder- <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="500"/> bolt blaze in his hand; and no one, I think, yet saw Zeus vanquished. Such then is the favour of the divinities on both sides, we are on the side of the conquerors, they on that of the conquered. And, inasmuch as Zeus was conqueror of Typhon in battle, it is likely that the men opposed to each other will fare even as [the gods they bear]; and for Hyperbius, in conformity with his device, may Zeus prove a protector.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker start-line="513" end-line="536">MESSENGER</speaker><p>May it prove so. I tell next of the fifth, who received the fifth station at the Borræan gate, over against the tomb of Zeus-born Amphion. He vows by
<pb n="93"/>
the spear which he carries, having the hardihood to reverence it more than any god and as more precious than his eyes, that surely he will sack the Cadmean city in spite of Zeus. Such is the speech of the handsome-faced offspring of a mountain-nurtured mother, a youth with a man's <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="520"/> spirit; and whiskers are just coming on his cheeks, his time of life producing them, thick hair growing up. And he, fierce in spirit that recalls not a maiden's name, and with grim countenance, stands nigh. Not indeed without a vaunting device does he station himself at the gate. On his bronze-wrought shield, the rounded defence of his body, he was swinging a Sphinx fastened to it with rivets, she that eats men raw, the reproach to our city, a shining figure hammered out from within. And beneath her she is carrying one of the Cadmeans, so that most shafts are <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="530"/> launched against this man. And now that he is come it is likely he will be no petty trafficker in battle,—nor bring discredit on his long journey hither, Parthenopaeus of Arcadia. A man of such quality is he, who has left his country and in repayment to Argos for her care in rearing him to comely manhood is threatening against these towers things which may Heaven not accomplish.</p></sp>

I myself shall doubtless enrich this soil with my blood, a seer lying in darkness beneath an enemy's land. Let us to the combat: I look for death but not dishonour. Such words spoke the seer, handling his rounded shield of bronze; and upon its circle there was no device, for his wish is, not to appear, but to be, a man of merit—reaping the harvest of a furrow deep in <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="580"/> his mind, whence spring his worthy resolves.</p></sp>

Thus shouts the stalwart Polynices, and calls upon the gods of his family to see to the full accomplishment of his prayers.

<p>A Chalybian stranger is apportioning their shares, coming from his Scythian home as a fatal distributer of possessions, —the cruel steel, which hath allotted to them so much land to dwell in as they occupy in death, [deciding that] <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="720"/> they share not between them the broad plains.</p>
<p>When by each other's hand they shall have perished by mutual wounds, and the dust of earth hath drunk the dark-clotted blood of their slaughter, who can bring purification? who is to cleanse them [of their guilt]? O fresh troubles of the house mingling with ancient ill-fortune!</p>
<p>Of ancient origin I say was the transgression so swiftly avenged. To the third generation it remains, ever since <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="730"/> Laius in defiance of Apollo, after that the god had three times announced at the Pythian oracle at the centre of earth that by dying without offspring he would<ref n="99.1">1</ref> preserve the State, yet over-persuaded by the foolish advice of those dear to him did beget his own destruction, Oedipus the son who slew his sire: even he who dared to sow the sacred field of his mother where he himself was fostered with a root [prolific of] bloodshed.

<p>But when he came to true knowledge, unhappy man, of his wretched marriage unable to bear his woes he wrought in his misery with frenzied heart a double mischief. With the hand that slew his sire, he deprived himself of his eyes dearer than his children,</p>

<p>O black Curse of Oedipus and his race now brought to accomplishment, a chill of sorrow falls upon my heart! Inspired [by grief], I compose a dirge for the grave, now <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="820"/> that I hear of their corpses dripping blood by evil fate thus dead. Ill omened indeed was their concert of spears.</p>
<p>It worked to fulfilment, nor did it relax—that solemn utterance from a father's lips; and the resolves of Laius due to his want of faith have had effect till now. Anxiety remains as to the city; for divine warnings do not lose their potency. Ah! ye whom we bewail, this that we <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="830"/> never looked for have ye done, and lamentable grief has come out of all reason.</p>
<stage>(The bearers carrying the corpses come into view.)</stage>
<p>Here now all is plain of itself. What the messenger told is now before our eyes. Twofold is our grief, double the evil fortune they have brought upon themselves, double the fated calamity now fulfilled. What shall I say? What else than that trouble is in the house? Come, dear ones, as the breeze of sorrow carries us along, wave your hands about your heads as ye escort the dead, in rhythmic movement which accompanies the passage across Acheron of the <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="840"/> unvoyaging ship with black sails, that is not trodden for the God of Day nor knows the sun, to the unseen landing-place that is the bourne of all.</p>
<p>But see, here are come Antigone and Ismene for this
<pb n="103"/>
mournful office, a dirge for their brethren. In no half-hearted fashion, I trow, will they for their loved ones utter from their deep-girdled bosoms a [strain of] grief befitting <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="850"/> the occasion. Us it behoves to sing, before their voice is heard, the sad-sounding Erinys-song and to raise thereafter the unwelcome Hades-chant. O ye most luckless in their brethren of all women who clasp the girdle about their robes, I weep for you and wail; and it is no guile to say that truly from my heart I raise this loud lament.</p>
<p>O misguided men, who would not be persuaded by your <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="860"/> friends, and in misfortune inexhaustible; unhappy ones, who ruined your ancestral homes by recourse to the spear. —Unhappy ones indeed, for ye found unhappy deaths, fraught with disaster to your house.</p>
<p>O ye who overthrew the walls of your home, and came to the sight of a fatal kingship, now are ye reconciled by recourse to the steel.—The awful curse of your father <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="870"/> Oedipus wrought a fulfilment true in deed. Stricken through the left sides, aye, stricken through sides born of a common mother, alas! thou wondrous ones; alas! for the curses resulting in death by each other's hand.—A home-thrust to house and body was [the blow] whereby thou sayest they were smitten in wrath that bears not telling, by a destiny due to a father's curse which they shared alike.</p>
<p>Through the city too there goes a sound of wailing; the <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="880"/> towers groan, and the plain that loved her heroes groans; whilst the possessions through which came strife, through which came doom of death to the ill-fated ones, will be for their descendants.—They made in their bitter wrath such <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="890"/> division of the possessions between themselves that each has now an equal share. The arbitrator at any rate has no blame from the friends [of either party], nor is Ares hailed as showing favour [to either side].</p>
<p>By the stroke of the steel they are as they are now, and
<pb n="104"/>
by stroke of steel there awaits them—what? some one may say—their share in the ancestral tomb.—A loud-sounding cry<ref n="104.1">1</ref> escorts them, a lamentation for these two princes, <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="900"/> heart-rending, bewailing its own griefs and its own woes, in anguish of mind, with no thought of joy, weeping tears that are truly from my heart, which as I mourn is wasting away.</p>

<p>[As epitaph] over the unhappy pair one may say, Much sorrow did they bring on their citizens and on all the ranks of foreigners who were destroyed in battle.—Hapless <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="910"/> beyond all women who have the name of mother was she who bore them. Having taken as husband her own son, she bore these princes; who have met their end, as ye see, in mutual slaughter each by the hand of his brother.</p>
<p>Brothers indeed, and now utterly destroyed by wounds unkind in frenzied strife as a termination to their feud.— Their hatred is stilled, and their life-blood is mingled with <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="920"/> the gory dust: thus are they united by blood indeed. A fatal resolver of contentions was the stranger that came from over-sea, the whetted steel; and fatal was that ill-divider of possessions, Ares, who brought to fulfilment their father's curse.</p>
<p>They have their shares, unhappy men, of heaven-sent sorrows, receiving each his portion; and underneath their <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="930"/> bodies they shall have a bottomless wealth of earth.—O ye who have made your family blossom forth in many a sorrow, at the last have the Curses cried over you their high-pitched strain, now that the whole race has been put to flight in utter rout.

Eteocles yonder, for his friendship towards this country, it is resolved to bury with loving interment in the earth; for it was in striving to keep out the foe that he got his own death <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1000"/> at this city. Pure in respect of the shrines of his ancestors and free from blame, he is dead [on the field of battle] where 'tis honourable for a young man to die. Thus with respect to him is it enjoined upon me to proclaim. But this man's brother, the dead body yonder of Polynices, [it is resolved] to cast out unburied, a prey to dogs, as one that would have been destroyer of the Cadmean town unless some divinity had stood in the way of his spear; and even
<pb n="107"/>
in death he shall have [the brand of] guilt in respect of his ancestral gods, without regard for whom he sought to take this city by launching against it a band of mercenaries. So <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1010"/> it is decreed that he shall receive his reward by being buried in unseemly wise by the fowls of the air; and there shall attend him neither raising of a mound by hand nor shall any show him respect with loud strains of mourning, but he shall be without honour of burial by his friends. Such is the decree of the Cadmean authority.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker start-line="1017" end-line="1032">ANTIGONE</speaker><p>Aye, but this have I to say to the Cadmean authorities:—Though none other consent to aid me in burying this man, I myself will bury him, and will undertake the risk of burying my own brother; nor am I ashamed at incurring [the reproach of] disobedience that refuses <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1020"/> submission to the State. A mighty influence is the common blood whence we are sprung, from an unhappy mother and an ill-fated sire. Willingly, therefore, for one who would not have willed it so, does my heart—the living for the dead— take a share in his misfortunes in sisterly spirit. His flesh never shall empty-bellied wolves gorge upon. Let no one think it. For I, though but a woman, will of myself contrive a tomb and [means of] interment for him, carrying [earth] <milestone unit="marginlnum" n="1030"/> in the bosom of my linen robe, and with my own hands will cover him. Let no one think the contrary. To my courage a plan will occur that will prove effective.</p></sp>
