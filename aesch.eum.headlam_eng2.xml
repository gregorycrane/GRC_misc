<p>First among the Gods I name with chiefest honour in this prayer the first diviner Gaea (Earth); and after her Themis (Law); for she, as a tradition telleth, took her seat here second upon that which was her mother's place of oracle; and third in succession, with the good-will and consent of Themis and with no force done to any, another Titaness and child of Earth took seat here, Phoebe; she bestowed it as a birthday gift on Phoebus, and he bears the name of Phoebe borrowed from her.<ref n="275.1">1</ref> He, coming from the lake and ridge of Delos, landed at the havening shores of Pallas, and came thence to this country and his seat upon Parnassus. He was brought upon his way with solemn worship by the sons of Hephaestus, the road-makers, taming the wildness of the untamed land. And on his coming he was most highly honoured by the people and by Delphos the sovereign ruler of this country. Zeus caused

<pb n="276"/>
his mind to be inspired with the diviner's art, and seated him as the fourth prophet on this throne; and Loxias is the interpreter of Zeus his father.</p>
<p>These are the Gods I worship in my opening prayer. And Pallas of the Precinct hath honourable mention also; and I adore the Nymphs, that habit where is the Corycian cavern, hollow, beloved of birds, the haunt of deities.— Bromius hath possessed the region—I am not forgetful— since the time when in his deity he led an army of the Bacchanals, designing death for Pentheus like a hunted hare. And with a call upon the springs of Pleistus, and Poseidon's power, and on the Most High Zeus of Consummation, I then take my seat as prophetess:—and may they grant me that my entrance now may be more successful far than any heretofore. And if there be any Hellenes present, let them come in order of the lot, as is the usage; for I give responses as the God dictates.</p>
<stage>(The PRIESTESS enters the temple, and presently comes out again, half fainting.)</stage>
<p>O horror, horror, horror to relate and to behold, hath sent me forth again from the house of Loxias, that I have no strength left in me nor agile step; my running is rather with my hands than nimbleness of legs; for an aged woman in alarm is nought—nay, even as a child.</p>
<p>I was on my way towards the laurelled cell, when on the Navel-stone I saw a man polluted before heaven in the session of a suppliant, his hands dripping with blood, and holding a drawn sword and a high-grown branch of olive, wreathed in humble fashion with the largest wool—a silvery fleece, for on that point I will speak with certainty.</p>
<p>And before this man there sleeps a wondrous troop of women seated upon thrones—no, not women, Gorgons:—
<pb n="277"/>
no, nor yet Gorgons either can I compare them to:—I have seen some in a picture before now carrying off the feast of Phineus—but these are wingless, and black, and abominable altogether. And they snore with blasts one cannot venture near, and from their eyes there drips a loathsome rheum. And their attire is such as is not fit to bring near statues of the Gods, nor into homes of men. My eyes have never seen the tribe these visitants belong to, and I know not the land that can boast to breed this generation without harm, and not repent her pains.</p>
<p>The sequel now must be his care who is the master of this house, the mighty Loxias himself: he is both Medicining-Seer and Portent-reader, and to those others purifier of their houses.</p>

<p>I will not fail! Through to the end I will be thy protector close by thy side—aye, and though far removed, —and will not show me gentle to thine enemies.

it is the evil darkness of the Pit that they inhabit under the earth, things abhorred by human kind and by the Gods of Heaven.

And let not thy spirit fail through too much dwelling on the toil of it, but go unto the town of Pallas, and take session, clasping her ancient image in thine arms.

Aeschylus might have written <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁρμωμένων</quote>, but <quote xml:lang="grc">σέβει τόδ' ἐκνόμων σέβας</quote> is an idiomatic way of saying <quote xml:lang="grc">σέβει τούσδε ἐκνόμους</quote>, as, for example, v. 548 <quote xml:lang="grc">τοκέων σέβας εὖ προτίων</quote>, and v. 886 <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν ἁγνόν ἐστι σοι Πειθοῦς σέβας</quote>: so that <quote xml:lang="grc">τόδ᾽ ἐκνόμων σέβας ὁρμώμενον</quote> is equivalent to <quote xml:lang="grc">τούσδε ἐκνόμους ὁρμωμένους</quote>, while <quote xml:lang="grc">βροτοῖσιν</quote> here, as often, merely means 'with men,' 'on earth.'

<p>Oh and yet plenty of my provisions have ye lapped —wineless drink-offerings, sober soothing-draughts, and banquets in the solemn night upon the burning brazier would I sacrifice, a season shared with you by none in Heaven.

'for when asleep the mind is lit with eyes, but in the daytime mortal man hath no endowment of prevision.' But the Furies are not mortal men, nor do they need foresight to see what is present; nor is Clytemnestra in a mood for such reflections. I believe with Schuetz that they are an illustration quoted from some other play of Aeschylus.

With <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλειαν</quote> and <quote xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἄγκρισιν ἐλθεῖν</quote>, it looks as though we had allusion to the Liturgies or Public Duties at Athens, and the legal right, which any citizen charged with such a liturgy possessed, of calling on some other person to perform it, as being better able to support the burden. The dispute between the rival claimants to immunity (<quote xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλεια</quote>) was adjudicated by the magistrates (<quote xml:lang="grc">διαδικασία</quote>). As the text stands, therefore, the Erinyes appear to say: 'We are not only willing, but anxious, to relieve the Celestials of this Liturgy, and to undertake the charge ourselves, without waiting for them to challenge us before a magistrate.'</p>
<p>The comparison of the Gods' concern for human affairs to a Liturgy is made by Lucian ii. 760: <quote xml:lang="grc">εἶτα καὶ προνοεῖν τῶν καθ᾿ ἡμᾶς πραγμάτων οὐ πᾶσιν ἐδόκουν οἱ θεοί, ἀλλ᾽ ἦσάν τινες οἱ τῆς συμπάσης ἐπιμελείας αὐτοὺς ἀφιέντες, ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς εἰώθαμεν ἀπολύειν τῶν λειτουργιῶν τοὺς παρηβηκότας</quote>.</p>

<p>Queen Athena, I will begin with thy last words and relieve thee of a great anxiety. I am not in need of purification, nor had I pollution on my hand when I took session at thine image. And I will show thee a strong testimony:—it is the law that the guilty suppliant should keep silence until at purifying hands he hath been blooded by the slaughter of a sucking swine.

<p>And I, returning,—having been before that time in exile, —slew my mother, I will not deny it, in blood-requital for my dearest father. And for this work Apollo Loxias is jointly answerable, who, to goad my heart, forewarned me of dire pains, if I refused to act thus on the guilty.

On his returning from the field, with the balance of advantage for the most part to the good, she gave him welcome first with words of kindness; and then, as he was performing his ablutions in the bath, and at the end of them, she cloaked a garment like a tent about his head,<ref n="303.1">1</ref> entangled him in the cunning endless robe, and hewed him down.

<quote xml:lang="grc">κτίσητε</quote> (Linwood's correction of <quote xml:lang="grc">στήσητε</quote>) is a synonym of <quote xml:lang="grc">θῆτε</quote> or <quote xml:lang="grc">ποιήσητε</quote>, and a favourite use with Aeschylus. The precise sense that he attached to <quote xml:lang="grc">δύσκηλον</quote> cannot be determined, but I feel sure the word is genuine, for this reason:—there were several Epic words in <quote xml:lang="grc">κηλ-</quote> whose meaning was a matter of debate,—<quote xml:lang="grc">κῆλον</quote> and <quote xml:lang="grc">περίκηλος</quote>, and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀεκήλια</quote> in Σ 77 (though that, no doubt, was. merely an Epic license for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀεικέλια</quote>, like <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπερείσια</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπειρέσια</quote>).

The sentence seems to call for <quote xml:lang="grc">ὦ</quote>, and in starting the procession to Athena at the <quote xml:lang="grc">Χαλκεῖα</quote> Sophocles frag. 760 uses the phrase <quote xml:lang="grc">βᾶτ’ εἰς ὁδὸν δή, πᾶς ὁ χειρῶναξ λεώς</quote>.</note>
<note n="319.2" type="footnote">This is a Paean of gladness, in dactylic metre, like those in Bergk Poetae Lyrici III p. 676 and in Eur. Phaethon 773. 66 seqq., and corresponds to that which was chanted at the Panathenaea: J.H.S. 1906, p. 274. </note>
<note type="footnote"> At the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλολύξατε νῦν ἐπὶ μολπαῖς</foreign> the Eumenides will join in
the women's cry of Ololu  ! The words themselves are probably uttered
by a Herald (whose commands were usually in anapaestic verse); and
if so, it is he who gives the warning <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφαμεῖτε</foreign>. </note></p></sp>
