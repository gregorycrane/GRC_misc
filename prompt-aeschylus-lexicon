# TEI XML Lexicon Conversion Prompt

Convert the following Greek/Latin lexicon entries into properly structured TEI XML markup. Follow these precise encoding guidelines:

## Structure Requirements

1. **Root Elements**: Wrap all entries in a complete TEI document with `<TEI>`, `<teiHeader>`, `<text>`, and `<body>` elements.

2. **Entry Structure**: Each lexicon entry should use:
   - `<entry xml:id="[unique_identifier]">` as the container
   - Create unique IDs based on the Greek headword (transliterated, lowercase)

3. **Headword Encoding**:
   - `<form><orth xml:lang="grc">[Greek headword]</orth></form>`
   - Always include `xml:lang="grc"` for Greek text

4. **Definition Encoding**:
   - `<sense><def xml:lang="lat">[Latin definition]</def></sense>`
   - Always include `xml:lang="lat"` for Latin definitions

5. **Source/Etymology**:
   - `<etym><lang>[source abbreviation]</lang></etym>`
   - Use for abbreviated source references like "Pers.", "Ch.", etc.

6. **Citation Structure**: For each textual example:
   ```xml
   <cit>
     <bibl>[work abbreviation and line number]</bibl>
     <quote xml:lang="grc">[Greek quotation]</quote>
     <note xml:lang="lat">[explanatory note]</note> <!-- if present -->
   </cit>
   ```

7. **Language Attributes**:
   - `xml:lang="grc"` for all Greek text
   - `xml:lang="lat"` for all Latin text
   - Apply consistently to `<orth>`, `<def>`, `<quote>`, and `<note>` elements

## Parsing Guidelines

- **Headwords**: Extract the Greek word that appears at the beginning of each entry
- **Definitions**: The Latin text following the headword (usually ending before source abbreviations)
- **Sources**: Abbreviated references like "Pers.", "Sept.", "Ch.", "Pr.", "Suppl."
- **Citations**: Line numbers followed by Greek quotations
- **Notes**: Explanatory Latin text introduced by "i.e." or similar markers
- **Multiple Citations**: Create separate `<cit>` elements for each quoted passage

## Output Format

Provide a complete, well-formed TEI XML document with proper namespace declaration and basic TEI header structure. Ensure all Greek and Latin text is properly tagged with language attributes.

**Input Format**: Provide the lexicon entries in their original format.
**Expected Output**: Complete TEI XML document following the above specifications.

Preserve Editorial Brackets: The square brackets around grammatical information for βαίνω are now maintained: [Perfectum est...]
Preserve Citation Brackets: The brackets around disputed citations like [Eum. 76... ] are kept intact to show editorial uncertainty about authenticity


You can just give me <entry/> items. I already have a TEI XML file with a header and will add this entries to that.
