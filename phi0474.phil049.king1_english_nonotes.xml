                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>ON at last securing a complete or at any rate a considerable release from the toils of advocacy<ref n="3.1">¹</ref> and from my senatorial duties, I have once more—chiefly, Brutus, on your encouragement—returned to those studies, which, though stored in memory, had been put aside through circumstances, and are now revived after a long interval of neglect. My view was that, inasmuch as the system and method of instruction in all the arts which have a bearing upon the right conduct of life is bound up with the study of wisdom which goes by the name of philosophy, it was incumbent on me to throw light upon that study by a work in the Latin tongue; not that philosophy could not be learnt from Greek writers and teachers, but it has always been my conviction that our countrymen have shown more wisdom everywhere than the Greeks, either in making discoveries for themselves, or else in improving upon what they had received from Greece—in such subjects at least as they had judged worthy of the devotion of their efforts.<ref n="3.2">²</ref></p>

               our ancestors have adopted better regulations and laws than others in directing the policy of government. What shall I say of the art of war? In this sphere our countrymen have proved their superiority by valour as well as in an even greater degree by discipline. When we come to natural gifts apart from book-learning they are above comparison with the Greeks or any other people. Where has such earnestness, where such firmness, greatness of soul, honesty, loyalty, where has such surpassing merit in every field been found in any of mankind to justify comparison with our ancestors?</p>

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>In learning Greece surpassed us and in all branches of literature, and victory was easy where there was no contest. For while with the Greeks the poets are the oldest literary class, seeing that Homer and Hesiod lived before the foundation of Rome and Archilochus<ref n="5.1">¹</ref> lived in the reign of Romulus, poetry came to us at a later date. About five hundred and ten years after the foundation of Rome Livius produced a play in the consulship of C. Claudius, son of Caecus, and M. Tuditanus in the year before the birth of Ennius, who was older than Plautus and Naevius.<ref n="5.2">²</ref></p>
         
               <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/> At a late date then were poets either known or welcomed by our countrymen. Though it is stated in the <hi rend="italics">Origines</hi>
                  <ref n="5.3">³</ref> that guests were in the habit of singing at banquets in honour of the virtues of famous men to the playing of a piper, yet a speech of Cato's shows that this kind of talent was not held in respect, for in it he censured M. Nobilior for having, as he declares, taken poets in his suite to his province. It is, as we know, matter of fact that Nobilior when consul had taken Ennius<ref n="5.4">⁴</ref> to Aetolia. The lighter then the esteem in which poetry was
               <pb n="7"/>
               held, the less was the devotion paid to it, and yet such writers as have by virtue of great natural endowments proved themselves poets, have not failed to be a worthy match for the glory of the Greeks.</p>
                  </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="section"><p>Or do we suppose that if Fabius Pictor, a man of noble family, had managed to win fame for his painting,<ref n="7.1">¹</ref> we too should not have had many a Polyclitus<ref n="7.2">²</ref> and Parrhasius? Public esteem is the nurse of the arts, and all men are fired to application by fame, whilst those pursuits which meet with general disapproval, always lie neglected. The Greeks held that the proof of the highest education was found in instrumental and vocal music: thus it is that Epaminondas, to my mind the leading man in Greek history, was, we are told, an accomplished singer to the accompaniment of the harp, whilst Themistocles, to go back many years previously, was held to show a lack of culture in refusing to play the lyre at banquets. Musicians accordingly flourished in Greece; everyone would learn music, and the man who was unacquainted with the art was not regarded as completely educated.</p>

               <p>With the Greeks geometry was regarded with the utmost respect, and consequently none were held in greater honour than mathematicians, but we Romans have restricted this art to the practical purposes of measuring and reckoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>But on the other hand we speedily welcomed the orator—not at first the cultivated but the ready speaker and at a later date the cultivated orator. For Galba, Africanus and Laelius were, as tradition has told us, well-read, while Cato who preceded them was a diligent student; next came Lepidus, Carbo and the Gracchi;<ref n="7.3">³</ref> after them up to our day
               <pb n="9"/>
               orators of such power that little or no ground at all was yielded in favour of the Greeks. Philosophy has lain neglected to this day, and Latin literature has thrown no light upon it: it must be illuminated and exalted by us, so that, if in the active business of life I have been of service to my countrymen, I may also, if I can, be of service to them in my leisure.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="section">
               <p>And I must exert myself all the more actively because there are now, it is said, a number of books in Latin<ref n="9.1">¹</ref> written without due care by writers who with all their merits are yet insufficiently equipped. Now it is possible for an author to hold right views and yet be unable to express them in a polished style; but to commit one's reflections to writing, without being able to arrange or express them clearly or attract the reader by some sort of charm, indicates a man who makes an unpardonable misuse of leisure and his pen. The result is that such writers read their own books themselves along with their own circle, and none of them reaches any wider public than that which wishes to have the same privilege of scribbling extended to itself. For this reason, if by my assiduity I have won for our countrymen some measure of oratorical renown, I shall with far greater enthusiasm lay bare the springs of philosophy, which were also the source from which those earlier efforts of mine took their rise.</p>

               wisdom with eloquence, similarly it is my design not to lay aside my early devotion to the art of expression, but to employ it in this grander and more fruitful art: for it has ever been my conviction that philosophy in its finished form enjoys the power of treating the greatest problems with adequate fulness and in an attractive style. To this endeavour I devoted myself with such energy that I actually reached the point of venturing to give dissertations in the manner of the Greeks: for instance, recently after your departure, as there were a number of close friends staying with me, I attempted in my house at Tusculum to see what I could do in this sort of exercise: for just as in my youth I used to be constantly declaiming speeches for the courts—and no one ever did so longer—so this is now a declamation<ref n="11.1">¹</ref> of my old age. I called upon my friends to put forward any subject which any of them wished to hear discussed, and this I debated either as I sat or walked about.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="8" subtype="section">
               <p>The result is that I have put together into five books the dissertations, as the Greeks term them, of as many days. The procedure was that, after the would-be listener had expressed his view, I opposed it. This, as you know, is the old Socratic method of arguing against your adversary's position; for Socrates thought that in this way the probable truth was most readily discovered; but in order that the course of our discussions may be more conveniently followed I shall put them before you in the form of a debate and not in narrative form.

                  <speaker>M.</speaker> And in fact, if you wish to be consistent, everyone who has been born or will be born is not only wretched but always wretched as well. For if your meaning were that only those who had to die were wretched, you would make an exception of no living person—for all have to die—still there would have been an end of wretchedness in death; seeing however that the dead too are wretched we are born to eternal wretchedness. For it must follow that those who died a hundred thousand years ago are wretched, or rather everyone who has been born.</p>

Some consider death the separation of the soul from the body; some think there is no such separation, but that soul and body perish together and the soul is annihilated with the body. Of those who think that there is a separation of the soul some hold that it is at once dispersed in space, others that it survives a long time, others that it survives for ever. Further, as to what the soul itself is in itself, or where its place in us, or what its origin, there is much disagreement. Some think the soul is the actual heart, and so we get the words "without heart," "wanting heart" and "of one heart," meaning "senseless," "feeble-minded" and "of one mind"; and the wise statesman Nasica,<ref n="23.1">1</ref> twice consul, got the name of "Goodheart" or "Sagacious," and so too

               it will vanish away. Why speak of Dicaearchus, a thinker who says the soul is nothing at all? According to all these views nothing can appertain to anyone after death, for along with life is lost the power of sensation; moreover there is nothing to make any sort of difference to a being without sensation.

When the soul has passed this tract and reaches to and recognizes a substance resembling its own, it stops amongst the fires which are formed of rarefied air and the modified glow of the sun and ceases to make higher ascent. For when it has reached conditions of lightness and heat resembling its own, it becomes quite motionless, as though in a state of equilibrium with its surroundings, and then, and not before, finds its natural home, when it has pierced to conditions resembling its own, and there, with all its needs satisfied, it will be nourished and maintained on the same food which maintains and nourishes the stars.<ref n="53.1">1</ref></p>

As if indeed they understood its nature, its shape, its size, its position whilst actually in the body. But supposing for the moment that all that is now concealed were discernible in the living man, would it seem likely that the soul could come within the scope of vision, or rather be of such fine substance as to escape the eye?</p>

For my part, when I study the nature of the soul, the conception of it in the body, as it were in a home that is not its own, presents itself as one much more difficult, much more doubtful than the conception of the nature of the soul when it has quitted the body and come into the free heaven, as it were to its home. For unless we are unable to realize the nature of what we have never seen, beyond doubt we can form a conception of God Himself and the divine soul set free from the body.

For everything which is set in motion by impulse from the outside is soulless; what on the other hand has soul is stirred by movement from within and its own.

But suppose, as these thinkers hold, that souls do not survive after death: I see that in that case we are deprived of the hope of a happier life. But what evil does such a view imply? For suppose that the soul perishes like the body: is there then any definite sense of pain or sensation at all in the body after death? There is no one who says so, though Epicurus accuses Democritus of this, but the followers of Democritus deny it. And so there is no sensation in the soul either, for the soul is nowhere. Where, then, is the evil, since there is no third thing? Is it because the actual departure of soul from body does not take place without sense of pain? Though I should believe this to be so, how petty a matter it is! But I think it false, and the fact is that often the departure takes place without sensation, sometimes even with a feeling of pleasure; and the whole thing is trivial, whatever the truth, for departure takes place in a moment of time.</p>

The famous Metellus<ref n="99.5">5</ref> had four sons who became dignitaries of state, but Priam had fifty, and seventeen of them born in lawful wedlock: in both these instances fortune had the same power of control, but exercised it in one; for a company of sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters placed Metellus upon the funeral pyre, Priam was bereft of his numerous family and slain by the hand of his enemy after he had fled

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>Such things are evaded by death, because although they have not taken place, yet they may take place; but men do not think it possible they can happen to themselves: each one hopes for himself the good fortune of Metellus, just as if more men were lucky than unlucky, or there were certainty in men's affairs or hope were wiser than apprehension. But let us go so far as to make the admission that mankind are deprived of blessings by death: must we therefore also grant that the dead feel the need of the comforts of life, and that this is a condition of wretchedness?<ref n="103.2">2</ref> Assuredly that is what they must say. Is it possible for the man who does not exist to "feel the need of" anything? The mere term "feeling the need of" has a melancholy sound, because the meaning that underlies it is, he had, he has not; he misses, looks for, wants. These, I think, are the discomforts of one who "feels the need of"; he "feels the need of" eyes, blindness is hateful; of children, barrenness is hateful. This holds good among the living, but as regards the dead, no one "feels the need," I do not say of the comforts of life, but even of life itself. I say this of the dead who do not exist; but do we who exist "feel the need" in this sense of horns or feathers? Can anyone make such a statement? Undoubtedly none. Why so? Because, as you are without that for which you are suited neither by acquired skill nor by nature, you cannot "feel the need of" it, even if you should be conscious that you do not possess it.</p>

            <div type="textpart" n="88" subtype="section">
               <p>This argument must be repeatedly insisted upon when we have firmly established the point, about which, if souls are mortal, we can have no doubt, namely that destruction in death is so complete that not even the faintest vestige of sensation is left behind: when that, then, is properly settled for once and all, we must thoroughly sift, so as to be sure of it, the meaning of "feeling the need of," that there may be no possibility of mistake in using the phrase. This then is the meaning of "feeling the   <pb n="105"/> need of,"<ref n="105.1">1</ref> to be in want of anything you wish to possess; for there is a notion of wish in "feeling the need of,"—except when the word <hi rend="italics">carere</hi> is used in another sense, as for instance of a fever, meaning "to be without fever." For it is using the word in quite a different sense to use it where one has not got something and is conscious of not having it, even if one can readily put up with being without it. To "feel the need of" is not used in connection with evil; for then evil would not be a thing to grieve about: the expression "to feel the need of" a good is used, and that amounts to an evil. But not even a living man "feels the need of" a good, if he does not want it. In the case of a living man it is, however, intelligible to say that you "feel the need of" a throne—that, however, cannot be said quite accurately in your case, though it could have been in the case of Tarquin after he had been dethroned<ref n="105.2">2</ref>—: 
                
                <pb n="107"/>
                still in the case of a dead man it is not even intelligible, for "to feel the need of" is appropriate to a sentient being, and in a dead man there is no sensation in a dead man therefore there is no possibility either of " feeling the need of."</p>

And so the man who concludes that the soul is mortal may yet attempt deeds that will not die, not from a thirst for fame, of which he will have no enjoyment, but from a thirst for virtue, which of necessity secures fame, even if it be not its object. If it is nature's law that, as our birth brings the beginning of all things, so death brings us the end of all: then, as we brought nothing into the world at birth, so we take nothing out of the world at death.

What is there then for you to complain of, if she calls it in when she will? Those were the terms on which you had accepted the loan. The same grumblers think that if a small child dies, the loss must be borne calmly; if an infant in the cradle, there must not even be a lament.

                     individuals, since we may observe the varied de-
                     ceptions under which races of mankind labour? The
                     Egyptians embalm their dead and keep them in the
                     house; the Persians even smear them with wax before
                     burial, that the bodies may last for as long a time as
                     possible; it is the custom of the Magi not to bury
                     the bodies of their dead unless they have been
                     first mangled by wild beasts; in Hyrcania the
                     populace support dogs for the benefit of the com-
                     munity, while the nobles keep them for family use :
                     it is as we know a famous breed of dogs, but in
                     spite of the cost, each householder procures animals

                  <p>Let the living, however, attend to
                     funeral observance to the extent to which they
                     must make a compromise with custom and public
                     opinion, but with the understanding that they
                     realize that in no way does it concern the dead.
                     But assuredly death is encountered with most
                     equanimity when the failing life can find solace
                     in the reputation it has won. No one has lived too
                     short a life who has discharged the perfect work
                     of perfect virtue. In my life there have been many
                     occasions when death would have been timely, and
                     would I could have found it! for there was no
                     longer anything to be won; life's duties had been
                     discharged in full; the war with fortune alone
                     remained. If therefore my arguments fail to con-
                     vince us that we can ignore death, yet let a life
                     completed make us think that we have lived
                     sufficiently and more. For though consciousness
                     may have gone, nevertheless the dead, unconscious
                     though they be, are not without their own peculiar
                     blessings of fame and glory. There is, it may be,
                     nothing in glory that we should desire it, but none
                     the less it follows virtue like a shadow.</p>

                     You, too lengthy? Not to my thinking. During
                     the first part of what you said the effect was to
                     make me long for death, whilst the effect of the
                     latter part was sometimes to make me feel not
                     unwilling, sometimes feel untroubled; the net result
                     of all you said, however, is that I do not reckon
                     death among evils. M. Do we then require in

                     Apollo at Delphi they worshipped the god and asked
                     in return for their toil and the work they had
                     accomplished a recompense, no light one it is true,

                     made known to them that he would grant their
                     prayer the third ensuing day, and when it dawned
                     they were found dead. The god, they say, gave
                     definite judgment, and he was the god to whom the
                     rest of the gods had granted the gift of prophecy

                  <p>By quoting these and similar authorities rhetoricians
                     maintain that in this trial the immortal gods have
                     given their verdict by facts. Alcidamas, for instance,
                     an ancient rhetorician of the first distinction, actually
                     wrote an encomium on death which consists of a list
                     of the evils to which mankind are exposed; he has
                     failed to give those deeper arguments which the
                     philosophers bring together, but he has not failed
                     in wealth of eloquence. But noble deaths, sought
                     voluntarily, for the sake of country, are not only
                     commonly reckoned glorious by rhetoricians but also
                     happy. They go back to Erechtheus, whose daugh-
                     ters sought even with eagerness for death to save
                     the lives of their fellow-citizens; they give the tale
                     of Codrus who flung himself into the midst of the

                     Harmodius and Aristogiton are often on the lips of
                     rhetoricians the Spartan Leonidas, Epaminondas of
                     Thebes, are much in evidence. Our Roman examples
                     they do not know of, and it would be an undertaking
                     to give the long roll of names: so numerous are
                     those who made, as we see, the choice of death with
                     honour. This being the case, we must employ the
                     resources of eloquence and deliver as from a pulpit
                     the message to mankind, either to begin to wish for
                     death, or at any rate cease to fear it. For if the
                     final day brings, not annihilation but a change of
                     place, what more can be wished for? But if on the
                     other hand that day brings total destruction and
                     obliteration, what can be better than to fall asleep
                     in the midst of the toils of life and so, closing one's
                     eyes, be lulled in everlasting slumber? Were that
                     so, the language of Ennius is better than Solon's. For
                     our poet says:

In the Hortensius, however, we have replied to the revilers of philosophy as a whole, whilst in the four books of the Academics we have set out, as we think with sufficient precision, all that could be urged on behalf of the Academy: all the same we are so far from deprecating criticism that we should even welcome it heartily, for even in its best days Greek philosophy would never have been held in such high honour, if the rivalries and disagreements of its chief exponents had not maintained its activity.</p>

And in oratory indeed our fame, from humble beginnings, has reached its zenith, with the result that now, as is the law of nature in almost everything, it is beginning its decline and seems destined in a short while to come to nothing:

It is impossible for me to express the delight or rather the feeling of comfort I derived from yesterday's discussion, for though I am not aware of having ever been over-anxious to live, nevertheless a shadow of fear and pain occasionally crossed my mind at the thought that one day there would be an end of this light of day and a loss of all the comforts of life.</p>

                  <p>M. There is nothing astonishing in that, for it shows the effect of philosophy: it is a physician of souls, takes away the load of empty troubles, sets us free from desires and banishes fears. But its influence cannot be the same for all its effect is great when it has secured a hold upon a character suited to it. For it is not only true that "fortune helps the brave," as the old proverb says, but philosophic thought does so in a far higher degree, and by its lessons strengthens as it were the quality of bravery. Nature clearly gave you at your birth a certain elevated and lofty spirit that looks down on things earthly, and so a speech delivered against death readily found a resting place in a brave soul. But can you think that these same arguments have real influence, apart from quite a few exceptions, with the very men by whom these arguments were discovered, reasoned out and committed to writing? How few philosophers are found to be so constituted and to have principles and a rule of life so firmly settled as reason requires! how few there are to think that the tenets of their school are not a display of knowledge but a law of life! to control themselves of their own will and obey their own dogmas!</p>

For what can be a stronger proof that she is of no assistance than that some finished philosophers live disgracefully? M. That is in truth no proof at all: for just as all fields that are tilled are not productive, and the following lines of Accius are false:
                     Though into poorer soil good seed be sown
                     The crops are fine by their own nature grown,
                     so all characters when cultivated do not bear fruit. And, to keep to the same comparison, just as a field, however fertile, can produce no crop without cultivation, so the soul can produce none without teaching. So true is it that either is feeble without the other. Now the cultivation of the soul is philosophy: it pulls out vices by the roots and makes souls ready to receive the seed, and commits to them and, so to speak, sows in them what, when fully grown, may bear the most abundant fruit.</p>

So true it is that the one without the other is ineffective.

I do not venture to go so far as that and I am ashamed of having been dislodged so speedily from my position. M. You should have been still more ashamed had you clung to it. For what is more unworthy than for you to regard anything as worse than disgrace, crime and baseness? And to escape these, what pain should be, I do not say rejected, but should not rather be voluntarily invited, endured and welcomed? A. I am entirely of that opinion.

They represent brave men wailing, they enervate our souls, and besides this they do it with such charm that they are not merely read, but learnt by heart. Thus when the influence of the poets is combined with bad family discipline and a life passed in the shade of effeminate seclusion, the strength of manliness is completely sapped. Plato<ref n="175.1">1</ref> was right then in turning them out of his imaginary State, when he was trying to find the highest morality and the best conditions for the community.

When then this endurance is both required of brave men and praised when found, is it not base either to shrink from the coming of pain or fail to bear its visitation? And yet, perhaps, though all right-minded states are called virtue, the term is not appropriate to all virtues, but all have got the name from the single virtue which was found to outshine the rest, for it is from the word for “man” that the word virtue is derived; but man's peculiar virtue is fortitude, of which there are two main functions, namely scorn of death and scorn of pain.

XIX. Epicurus steps forward,—in no sense an ill-meaning person, or rather a gentleman of the best intentions, he gives advice to the extent of his ability. “Ignore pain,” he says. Who says this? The same thinker who pronounces pain the highest evil. This is not quite consistent. Let us listen. “If pain is at its highest,” says he, “it must be short.”
“Repeat that once again to me!”<ref n="197.1">1</ref>
For I do not quite understand what you mean by “at its highest” and what you mean by “short.” “By ‘at the highest’ I mean that which has nothing higher; by ‘short’ I mean that which has nothing shorter. I scorn a degree of pain from which a brief space of time will deliver me almost before it has come.” But what if the pain be as severe as that of Philoctetes? “I admit it seems to me pretty severe, but all the same it is not at the highest; for his pain is only in the foot; there can be pain in the eyes, pain in the head, sides, lungs, pain everywhere. He is therefore far from suffering pain at the highest.” “Therefore,” says he, “continuous pain admits of more of gladness than of vexation.”<ref n="197.2">2</ref></p>

Boys endure from love of fame, others endure for shame's sake, many from fear, and yet are we afraid that nature cannot put up with what so many have endured in such a number of different places? Nature in fact not only puts up with but even demands it; for she offers nothing more excellent, nothing more desirable than honour, than renown, than distinction, than glory.

For the soul has certain analogies to the body: weights are more easily carried by straining every nerve of the body: relax the strain and the weights are too heavy; quite similarly the soul by its intense<ref n="209.2">2</ref> effort throws off all the pressure of burdens, but by relaxation of effort is so weighed down that it cannot recover itself.</p>

Athletes do the same in training; boxers in fact, at the moment of striking their opponent, groan in the act of swinging their gauntlets, not that they feel pain or are losing heart, but because by the burst of sound the whole body is made more tense and the blow comes with greater force.
XXIV. What? When men want to shout louder it is not enough, is it, to intensify the effort of sides and throat and tongue from which we see the voice jerked out with such a burst? No! With the whole force of the body, with tooth and nail,<ref n="211.1">1</ref> as the saying is, they second the straining of the voice.</p>

And as the effect of strain is so powerful, we shall indulge in a groan at an access of pain, if it can avail to strengthen the soul; but if the groan is melancholy, weak, despondent, piteous—I can scarcely give the name of man to him who has succumbed. Should a groan indeed bring some degree of relief, we should nevertheless find it consistent with the character of a brave and spirited man: seeing, however, that it</p>

To enable us to bear pain quietly and calmly it is a very great gain to reflect with all our heart and mind, as the saying is, how honourable<ref n="213.2">2</ref> it is to do so. Nature has made us, as I have said before—it must often be repeated—enthusiastic seekers after honour, and once we have caught, as it were, some glimpse of its radiance, there is nothing we are not prepared to bear and go through in order to secure it.

In your case, however, should you become a figure in the eyes of the mob, I should nevertheless not like you to be dependent on their judgment, nor wish you to accept their view of what is fairest: you must use your own judgment; if you are content with yourself in approving the right, then you will not only win a victory over self, a rule I laid down a little while back, but over the world of men and things.</p>

We find accordingly some uncivilized barbarians able to fight desperately to the end with the sword but unable to behave like men in sickness. The Greeks on the other hand, who are not so very courageous but have a sufficiency of sense answering to their mental powers, cannot look an enemy in the face;<ref n="221.1">1</ref> and yet these same men show endurance and spirit, as human beings should, in bearing sickness, while the Cimbri and Celtiberians<ref n="221.2">2</ref> revel in battle and wail in sickness.

Reflect on these considerations, I pray, by day and night, for this principle will spread more widely in its application and cover a field a good deal larger than the consideration of pain alone; for if we are to do everything with the object of avoiding baseness and securing honour, we shall have the right of despising not merely the stings of pain but the bolts of fortune as well, especially</p>

                  <p>unhealthiness and sickness of soul which they have termed “unsoundness.”</p>

               <div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="section">
                  <p>Now philosophers apply the term disease to all disorders of the soul and they say that no foolish person is free from such diseases; sufferers from disease, however, are not sound, and the souls of all unwise persons are diseased: therefore all unwise persons are of “unsound” mind]. For they<ref n="235.1">1</ref> considered that the sound health of souls consisted in a state of equable calm: they applied the term “unsoundness” to the mind that was not in this state, because they thought that in a disordered soul, as in a disordered body, soundness of health was impossible.</p>

                  <p>V. And there was no less insight in their giving to a condition of the soul, marked by an absence of the illuminating influence of the mind, the name of “mindlessness” as well as “aberration of mind”:<ref n="235.2">2</ref> and from this we must understand that those who gave these names to such conditions held the view which the Stoics took from Socrates and steadily adhered to, that all unwise persons are in an “unsound” state. For the soul which is suffering from some disease—now philosophers as I have said apply the term disease to these disordered movements —is no more in a sound condition than the body which is diseased. It follows that wisdom is a sound condition of the soul, unwisdom on the other hand a sort of unhealthiness which is unsoundness and also aberration of mind; and these attributes are much better connoted by the Latin terms than by the Greek, as will be found also in many other instances.<ref n="235.3">3</ref> But of that elsewhere; now for the business in hand.</p>

                  <p>The nature then and meaning of the whole question at issue is shown by the exact force of the term.<ref n="237.1">1</ref> For seeing that it must be understood that those, whose mind has not been thrown into disorder by any movement of the nature of a disease, are in a “sound” condition, the term “unsound” must be applied to those who on the contrary are suffering from disorder. Consequently there is nothing better than the usage of the Latin language, where we say that those who are unbridled in the indulgence of either lust or wrath are beside themselves<ref n="237.2">2</ref> (though in fact wrath itself comes under the head of lust, for the definition of wrath is lust of vengeance).<ref n="237.3">3</ref> Those then who are described as beside themselves are so described because they are not under the control of mind to which the empire of the whole soul has been assigned by nature. Now I cannot readily give the origin of the Greek term μανία:<ref n="237.4">4</ref> the meaning it actually implies is marked with better discrimination by us than by the Greeks, for we make a distinction between “unsoundness” of mind, which from its association with folly has a wider connotation, and “frenzy.” The Greeks wish to make the distinction but fall short of success in the term they employ: what we call frenzy they call μελαγχολία,<ref n="237.5">5</ref> just as if the truth were that the mind is influenced by black bile and not in many instances by the stronger power of wrath or fear or pain, in the sense in which we speak of the frenzy of Athamas, Alcmaeon, Ajax and Orestes.<ref n="237.6">6</ref> Whosoever is so afflicted is not allowed by the Twelve Tables<ref n="237.7">7</ref> to</p>

And though this seems to be worse than unsoundness of mind, nevertheless there is this to be noted, that frenzy can come upon the wise man, unsoundness of mind cannot.<ref n="239.1">1</ref> But this is a different problem: let us return to our subject.</p>

And it is not ridiculous of the famous Crantor,<ref n="239.3">3</ref> who held the foremost place of distinction in our Academy, to say, “I do not in the least agree with those who are so loud in their praise of that sort of insensibility<ref n="239.4">4</ref> which neither can nor ought to exist.

                  <p>But let us have a care lest this be the language of those who flatter the infirmity of our nature and regard its weakness with complacency; for ourselves let us have the courage, not merely to lop the branches of wretchedness, but tear out all the fibres of its roots. Yet even then there will, perhaps, be some left; the roots of folly go so deep; yet only that much will be left which must be left. Be persuaded at any rate of this, that there will be no end to wretchedness unless the soul is cured, and without philosophy this is impossible. Therefore let us put ourselves in the hands of philosophy for treatment, since we have made a beginning: we shall be cured if we will. And indeed I shall go a step further, for I shall deal not merely with the subject of distress, though that will come first, but, as I have stated, with the whole subject of disturbance—“disease” as the Greeks prefer—of the soul. And to begin with, if you agree, let us follow the example of the Stoics whose practice it is to give briefly a compendious statement of their proofs; after that we shall roam at large in our accustomed way.</p>

The brave man is also self-reliant; for “confident” is by a mistaken usage of speech used in a bad sense, though the word is derived from confidere, “to have trust,” which implies praise. The self-reliant man, however, is assuredly not excessively fearful; for there is a difference between confidence and timidity. And yet the man who is accessible to distress is also accessible to fear. For where things cause us distress by their presence, we are also</p>

                  <p>afraid of the menace of their approach. So it comes that distress is incompatible with fortitude. It is therefore probable that the man who is susceptible of distress is also susceptible of fear, and indeed of dejection and depression of soul. Where men are susceptible of these emotions there also comes a feeling of subjection, a readiness to admit themselves beaten should occasion arise. He who makes this admission has to admit fear and cowardice as well. But of such feelings the brave man is not susceptible: therefore he is not susceptible of distress either. But no one is wise if he is not brave. Therefore the wise man will not be susceptible of distress.</p>

                  <p>Moreover the brave man must also be high-souled, and the high-souled must be unconquered; and the unconquered must look down on human vicissitudes and consider them beneath him. But no one can look down upon the things which can make him suffer distress. And from this it follows that the brave man never suffers distress. But all wise men are brave. Therefore the wise man is not susceptible of distress. And just as the eye, if out of order, is not in a right condition for discharging its function, and the other members, or the body as a whole, if it is not in its normal condition, fails to perform its function and work: similarly the soul, if disquieted, is not fitted to carry out its work. But the work of the soul is the right use of reason, and the soul of the wise man is always in a condition to make the best use of reason. Therefore it is never in a disordered state. But distress is a disorder of the soul. Therefore the wise man will always be free from it.</p>

It is then wholly in an idea that we find the cause not merely indeed of distress but of all other disturbances as well, and these can be classified as four with numerous subdivisions. For as all disturbance is a movement of the soul either destitute of reason, or contemptuous of reason, or disobedient to reason, and as such a movement is provoked in two ways, either by an idea of good or idea of evil, we have four disturbances equally divided. For there are two proceeding from an idea of good, one of which is exuberant pleasure, that is to say, joy excited beyond measure by the idea of some great present good; the second is the intemperate longing for a supposed great good, and this longing is disobedient to reason, and may be rightly termed desire or lust.</p>

                  <p>Alleviation of distress, however, Epicurus finds in two directions, namely in calling the soul away from reflection upon vexation and in a “recall”<ref n="267.1">1</ref> to the consideration of pleasures. For he thinks the soul able to obey reason and follow its guidance. Reason therefore (in his view) forbids attention to vexations, withdraws the soul from morose reflections, blunts its keenness in dwelling upon wretchedness and, sounding a retreat from such thoughts, eagerly urges it on again to descry a variety of pleasures and engage in them with all the powers of the mind; and according to this philosopher the wise man's life is packed with the recollection of past and the prospect of future pleasures.

For under the smart of circumstances which we regard as evil, concealment or forgetfulness is not within our control: circumstances tear us in pieces, worry and goad us; their touch is fiery; they do not allow us to breathe. And do you, Epicurus, bid me "forget," though to forget is contrary to nature, while you wrest from my grasp the aid which nature has supplied for the relief of long-standing pain? For there is a remedy, slow-working it is true but effectual, brought about by the long lapse of time. You bid me reflect on good, forget evil.

But what is more vile or disgraceful than a womanish man? Justice even will not suffer you to act in such a way; there seems but little need for her in this case, but yet her plea will be that you are doubly unjust, since in demanding, in spite of your mortal origin, the attribute of the immortal gods, and in repining at the repayment of the gift you have received as a loan, you are longing for what is not your own.</p>

                  <p>Why do we shirk the question, Epicurus, and why do we not confess that we mean by pleasure what you habitually say it is, when you have thrown off all sense of shame? Are these your words or not? For instance, in that book which embraces all your teaching (for I shall now play the part of translator, that no one may think I am inventing) you say this: “For my part I find no meaning which I can attach to what is termed good, if I take away from it the pleasures obtained by taste, if I take away the pleasures which come from listening to music, if I take away too the charm derived by the eyes from the sight of figures in movement,<ref n="275.2">2</ref> or other pleasures produced by any of the senses in the whole man. Nor indeed is it possible to make such a statement as this—that it is joy of the mind which is alone to be reckoned as a good; for I understand by a mind in a state of joy, that it is so, when it has the hope of all the pleasures I have named—that is to say the hope that nature will be free to enjoy them without any blending of pain.”</p>

Here we have at last the good things which enable us to get rid of the most grievous distresses. For you explained a little while ago that you did not even understand any others.

For I see that many of his utterances breathe an austere and many a noble spirit.<ref n="281.1">1</ref> Consequently, as I have often said, the question at issue is his intelligence, not his morality. However much he may scorn the pleasures he has just approved, yet I shall remember what it was that he thinks the highest good. For he has not only used the term pleasure, but stated clearly what he meant by it. “Taste,” he says, “and embraces and spectacles and music and the shapes of objects fitted to give a pleasant impression to the eyes.” I am not inventing, I am not misrepresenting, am I? I long to be refuted. For why am I exerting myself except to get the truth in every problem unravelled?</p>

For just now he said that he had not even an inkling of any good, unless the senses were in some sort tickled with pleasure; now, on the contrary, he says that the highest pleasure is freedom from pain. Is it possible to be more self-contradictory? The second mistake is that, as these are three natural states, one of joy, the second of pain, the third of neither joy nor pain, he here thinks the first and third identical and makes no distinction between pleasure and absence of pain. The third mistake he shares with certain philosophers,<ref n="283.1">1</ref> that, though virtue is the object of our eager seeking and philosophy has been devised for the sake of securing it, Epicurus has severed the highest good from virtue.</p>

The famous Piso, named Frugi, had spoken consistently against the Corn-law.<ref n="283.2">2</ref> When the law was passed, in spite of his consular rank, he was there to receive the corn.

But on a careful consideration of the nature of the unexpected you would find nothing else, except that all sudden occurrences are magnified, and that for two reasons: first because no scope is given for weighing the magnitude of the occurrences; secondly because, where it seems that previous precautions could have been taken if sufficient foresight had been shown, the evil incurred,</p>

For we have on the tip of our tongues as a rule the words “nothing should seem unexpected.” But how will the burden of loss be more endurable for the man who has recognized that something of the kind must happen to a human being? For this way of speaking takes nothing from the actual sum of evil; all it does is to suggest that nothing has taken place which should not have been expected. And yet such a mode of speaking is not without effect in imparting comfort; I should rather be inclined to think it had very great effect. Therefore such things as are unexpected do not have enough influence to account for all distress that arises; for the shock they cause is perhaps heavier, but they do not make the occurrences seem more serious; they seem more serious because their impression is still fresh, not because of their suddenness.</p>

<lg type="embedding">
<l>No mortal is there but pain finds him out</l>

<l>And sow fresh issue; death is end for all;</l>

He said that this way of speaking had no bearing at all on the alleviation of distress; for he argued that the actual call to grief came from the fact that we were subject to a necessity so cruel. For Euripides' way of speaking was suited to bring comfort to ill-disposed people from the recital of the evils of others. My view, however, is far different. For the thought that the lot of man must be endured prevents us from contending as it were against God and also warns us that we are human: and this reflection is a great relief to sorrow, and the detailed instances cited are not given to delight the mind of the ill-natured, but to lead the mourner to think that he must bear the burdens which he sees many men have borne in a spirit of quiet restraint.</p>

Secondly men also think that by the intensity of their grief they are gratifying the dead. Add to these a certain womanish superstition; for they think they will more easily satisfy the immortal gods, if they admit that they are crushed and prostrated by an overwhelming blow. But the majority do not see how inconsistent these ideas are. For they praise those who, they think, meet death calmly; any who bear another's death with calmness they consider deserving of censure.

For the fault here is not nature's, the blame rests with us; and the folly<ref n="313.2">2</ref> of it you may attack as much as you like. For both those who get no relief are wretched by their own invitation, and those, who bear their own misfortunes in a spirit different from that which they have themselves advocated in the case of others, are not worse than, as a rule, many avaricious men who censure the avaricious, or ambitious men who censure the ambitious; for it is a peculiarity of folly to discern the faults of others and be forgetful of its own.</p>

For if the circumstances are the same and the person is the same, how can there be any change in the grief felt, if there is no change either in the reason for the grief or in the person who feels it? Continued reflection therefore that there is no evil in the circumstances has a healing effect upon pain, not the continuance of time alone.

                  <p>It has, I think, been sufficiently insisted on that distress is the idea of a present evil with this implication in it, that it is a duty to feel distress.

This word, however, his followers interpret to mean that not only, according to their view, is that “fresh” which has taken place a short time previously, but that so long as the imagined evil preserves a certain power of being vigorous and retaining so to speak its greenness,<ref n="315.2">2</ref> it is termed “fresh.” For instance the famous Artemisia, wife of Mausolus, King of Caria, who built the celebrated burial monument at Halicarnassus, lived in sorrow all her days and wasted away under its enfeebling influence.

And yet it seems to me Cleanthes has not quite seen that the feeling of distress can sometimes arise from the very thing which he himself admits to be the worst evil of all. For what shall we say—seeing that Socrates, as we are told, convinced Alcibiades that he was in no true sense a man and that there was no difference, for all his high position, between him and any poor porter, whereupon Alcibiades was much distressed and implored Socrates with tears to teach him virtue and drive baseness away,—what shall we say, Cleanthes?

It is a hard matter to prove to a mourner that he is mourning of his own choice and because he thinks he ought to do so. No need to wonder then that in the conduct of cases in court we do not always take up the same position<ref n="321.2">2</ref> (this is the term we apply to lines of argument in disputes), but we adapt the line we take to the occasion, to the character of the dispute, to the personality of the litigant; we act similarly in the alleviation of distress, for we have to consider what method of treatment is admissible in each particular case.</p>

Your statement referred to the wise man who cannot think that there is any evil where there is no disgrace, or else thinks the evil so insignificant that it is overwhelmed by wisdom and is scarcely visible; for the wise man does not call in any imaginary belief to buttress distress, or think it right to let himself be cruelly tortured and weakened by sorrow, as he thinks nothing can be more degraded. Nevertheless the course of our argument has shown, it appears to me, that though the actual question, whether anything was evil unless it could also be described as disgraceful, was not specifically put at the time—nevertheless, I say, we have come to see that, whatever evil there is in distress, it is not due to nature, but brought to a head by a judgment of the will and by mistaken belief.</p>

Brutus, the founder of your famous house, set his country free. Now, as the teaching of Pythagoras spread far and wide, it penetrated, as I think, into our State, and this, besides being likely as a conjecture, has also definite pieces of evidence in its favour. For as there were at that time great and powerful Greek cities in Italy, the district in which they flourished being called Magna Graecia, and as the name of Pythagoras himself and after him of the Pythagoreans had such remarkable influence in those cities, who can imagine that the ears of our countrymen were closed to the echo of their wisdom?</p>

Where this takes place in an equable and wise way the Stoics employ the term βούλησις for this sort of longing,<ref n="341.1">1</ref> we should employ the term wish.

Consequently they define them more precisely, that it may be realized not only how wrong they are but to what extent they are under our control. Distress then is a newly formed belief of present evil, the subject of which thinks it right to feel depression and shrinking of soul; delight is a newly formed belief of present good, and the subject of it thinks it right to feel enraptured; fear is a belief of threatening evil which seems to the subject of it insupportable; lust is a belief of prospective good and the subject of this thinks it advantageous to possess it at once upon the spot. But they do not think that only the disorders depend upon the judgments and beliefs from which disorders, as I have said, come, but that on them also depend the results of the disorders; and so it is that distress results in some sting as it were of pain, fear in a kind of withdrawal and flight of the soul, delight in extravagant gaiety, lust in unbridled longing.

Moreover from disorders are produced, in the first place, diseases (for which the term is νοσήματα), and besides these the affections which are the opposites of such diseases and which are accompanied by unwholesome aversion and loathing for certain things; secondly there are produced sicknesses, termed by the Stoics ἀῤῥωστήματα, and these too have corresponding aversions which are their " opposites."<ref n="351.2">2</ref> At this point far too much attention is devoted by the Stoics, principally by Chrysippus, to drawing an analogy between diseases of the soul and diseases of the body.

Whilst there is theoretically a difference between the ailments I am dealing with, in practice at any rate they are combined and their origin is found in lust and delight. For when money is coveted and reason is not at once applied as a kind of Socratic remedy to cure the desire, the evil circulates in the veins and fastens on the vital organs, and disease and sickness ensue, things which cannot be plucked out when they are long established; and for such a disease the name is avarice. And similarly the other diseases like thirst for fame, like love of women, to give this term to what the Greeks call φιλογυνία, and all other diseases and sicknesses originate in similar fashion. It is thought moreover that fear is the origin of their opposites like hatred of women, as for instance in the Μισόγυνος of Atilius,<ref n="353.1">1</ref> like the hatred of all mankind felt we are told by Timon<ref n="353.2">2</ref> who is termed μισάνθρωπος, and like inhospitality: and all these sicknesses of the soul originate in a certain fear of the things they avoid and hate.</p>

Now to come to the analogy of health and to make use at last of this comparison (but more sparingly than is the way of the Stoics), as some men are more prone to some diseases and other men to others, and so we say of certain people that they are liable to catch cold, certain others to attacks of colic, not because they are suffering at the moment but because they frequently do so; in the same way some men are prone to fear, others to another disorder, in consequence of which in some cases we speak of an anxious temper and hence of anxious people, in other cases of irascibility which is different from anger, and it is one thing to be irascible, another thing to be angry, just as an anxious temper is different from feeling anxiety; for not all men who are at times anxious are of an anxious temper, nor are those who have an anxious temper always feeling anxious, just as for instance there is a difference between intoxication and habitual drunkenness, and it is one thing to be a gallant and another thing to be in love. Moreover this proneness of some men to one disease and others to another is of wide application; for it applies to all disorders.</p>

But in the case of what is good, because some men are better adapted to one sort of good and others to another, let it be named inclination; in the case of what is evil let it be named proneness so as to suggest slipping; in the case of what is neither good nor bad let it have the earlier name.</p>

Disease is the term applied to a break-down of the whole body, sickness to disease attended by weakness, defect when the parts of the body are not symmetrical with one another and there ensue crookedness of the limbs, distortion, ugliness. And so the first two, disease and sickness, are a result of shock and disorder to the bodily health as a whole; "defect,” however, is discernible of itself, though the general health is unimpaired. But in the soul we can only separate disease from sickness theoretically. Defectiveness,<ref n="357.2">2</ref> however, is a habit or a disposition which is throughout life inconsistent and out of harmony with itself. So it comes that in the one perversion of beliefs the result is disease and sickness, in the other the result is inconsistency and discord. For not every defect involves equal want of harmony, as for instance the disposition of those who are not far off</p>

For as in the body the adjustment of the various parts, of which we are made up, in their fitting relation to one another is health, so health of the soul means a condition when its judgments and beliefs are in harmony, and such health of soul is virtue, which some say is temperance alone,<ref n="359.2">2</ref> others a condition obedient to the dictates of temperance and following close upon it and without specific difference, but whether it be the one or the other, it exists, they say, in the wise man only.

For what can seem of moment in human occurrences to a man who keeps all eternity before his eyes and knows the vastness of the universe? Nay, what either in human ambitions or in the short</p>

It has been recorded in Fannius<ref n="371.2">2</ref> that P. Rupilius was distressed at his brother's failure to be elected to the consulship. But all the same he seems to have passed the limit, since he died of chagrin. He ought therefore to have shown more restraint. Well, suppose that, though he showed moderation under this blow, there had come in addition the loss of children? a new distress would have arisen: grant it a moderate one: still an addition of consequence would have been made. Well, suppose that subsequently severe bodily pains, suppose loss of property, suppose blindness, suppose exile had followed. If there were an addition of distress to match each separate evil, there would be a sum total impossible to bear.</p>

Again, what of the contention of the same Peripatetics that these selfsame disorders which we think need extirpating are not only natural but also bestowed on us by nature for a useful end? This is the language they use. In the first place they praise irascibility<ref n="373.1">1</ref> at great length; they name it the whetstone of bravery and say that the assaults of angry men upon an enemy or disloyal citizen show greater vehemence; but that there is no substance in the petty logic of those who coldly argue like this: "It is right to fight this battle; it is proper to contend for laws, for liberty, for country;" that these words have no meaning unless bravery breaks out in a blaze of anger. And they do not argue about warriors only; no stern commands in time of need are given, they think, without something of the keen edge of irascibility. Finally they do not approve of an orator unless he uses the prickles of irascibility, not merely in bringing an accusation but even in conducting a defence, and though the anger be not genuine, yet it should, they think, be feigned in language and gesture, that the delivery of the orator may kindle the anger of the hearer.

Themistocles walked by night in a public place because he was, he said, unable to sleep, and in answer to questions replied that he was kept awake by the trophies of Miltiades. Who has not heard of the sleeplessness of Demosthenes? who said that he was grieved if ever he had been beaten by the diligence of workmen rising before the break of day. Lastly the leaders of philosophy itself would never have been able to make such prodigious advance in their studies without a fiery longing. We have been told that Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato journeyed to the ends of the earth; for they judged it their duty to go where there was something to be learnt, whatever it might be.

When such principles have been established by judgment and thought, then appears the strong and steady bravery we are looking for, unless, it may be, our notion is that acts done in an impetuous, fiery and high-spirited way are done in a mood of irascibility. To my mind even that Scipio,<ref n="383.2">2</ref> the chief pontiff, who verified the truth of the Stoic maxim that the wise man is never out of office, does not seem to have been angry with Tiberius Gracchus when he left the spiritless consul and, though himself holding no official position, called, as though he were consul, upon all who desired the safety of the commonwealth to follow him.

For this was the way in which that leader of philosophy argued, that as was the disposition of each individual soul so was the man; and as was the man in himself so was his speech; moreover deeds resembled speech and life resembled deeds. Further the disposition of the soul in a good man is praiseworthy, and therefore the life of a good man is praiseworthy, and for that reason right, seeing that it is praiseworthy. And from these arguments the conclusion comes that the life of good men is happy.</p>

      <div type="textpart" n="48" subtype="section">
        <p>And rightly so, for—in the name of gods and men !—
            <pb n="475"/>has  not sufficient been learnt from our previous discussions; or is it for the sake of amusement and passing the time that we have said that the wise man is always free from all agitation of soul to which I give the name of disturbance? that in his soul there reigns the most tranquil calm? The man then who is temperate, steadfast, without fear, without distress, without any eagerness, without lust, is he not happy? But such is the character of the wise man always: therefore the wise man is always happy. Again, how can the good man fail to refer all his acts and feelings to the standard he holds to be praiseworthy?
      
        But he refers everything to the standard of living happily;<ref n="475.1">1</ref> therefore happy life is praiseworthy; and without virtue nothing is praiseworthy; happy life therefore is consummated by virtue.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" n="49" subtype="section">
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/> And this conclusion is proved again in the following way: neither in a wretched life nor in such a life as is neither wretched nor happy is there anything commendable or worthy of glory; and yet in the lives of some men there is something commendable, illustrious and exemplary, as in the life of Epaminondas :</p>
        <p>Shorn by the counsels I gave was the Lacedaemonian glory,<ref n="475.2">2</ref></p>
        <p>and of Africanus :</p>

</div>
      <div type="textpart" n="50" subtype="section">
        <p>So then, if happy life is a reality, it is worthy of 
             <pb n="477"/> glory and commendable and exemplary; for there is nothing else to be commendable and exemplary. And when this is established you realize what is the conclusion, and in any case, unless the life which is at the same time right is happy, there must of necessity be something else better than happy life. For surely they will admit that what is found to be right is better: consequently there will be something better than happy life, and can any statement more wrong-headed than this be made? Tell me! when they admit that vice has sufficient power to make life wretched, must they not admit that virtue has the same power to make life happy? For from things that are opposed consequences that are opposites follow logically.</p>

        <p>What then prevents either this thinker or the famous Xenocrates<ref n="477.2">2</ref> as well, that most influential of philosophers, who exalts virtue so earnestly and depreciates and rejects everything else, from making not merely happy life depend upon virtue but supremely happy life as well?

And what can be happier than this I certainly cannot conceive.</p>

      <div type="textpart" n="82" subtype="section">
        <p>For the Stoics indeed the conclusion is easy, since they hold it the sovereign good to live according to nature and in harmony with nature, seeing that not only is this the wise man's settled duty but also it lies in his power, and so for them it follows necessarily that where a man has the chief good in his power, he also has the power of happy life: thus the life of the wise is rendered happy always.

And since it appears that what you wish established is that, whatever the views held by warring sects about the limits<ref n="511.3">3</ref> of good and evil, nevertheless virtue is sufficient security for a happy life, a proposition which Carneades we are told habitually discussed<ref n="511.4">4</ref>-but he did so heatedly, as was his way in opposing the Stoics whom he was always most eager to refute, and against whose teaching his temper had fired up-for my part I shall treat the question calmly.

        <p>These then are the simple; the next are composite : three kinds of good, the highest of the soul, second of the body, third from the outside, as the Peripatetics,<ref n="513.3">3</ref> and the Old Academy are much the same ; Dinomachus and Callipho<ref n="513.4">4</ref> have coupled pleasure with rectitude; the Peripatetic Diodorus<ref n="513.5">5</ref> has joined, however, freedom from pain to rectitude.</p>
      </div>

        <p>These are the views which have some solid support; for those of Aristo, Pyrrho, Herillus<ref n="513.6">6</ref> and some others have melted into air.

And besides them the Peripatetic case is cleared up: apart from Theophrastus<ref n="513.7">7</ref> and any who follow him in a feeble dread and abhorrence of pain, it is allowable for the rest of them at any rate to do as they usually do, that is to say, exalt the dignity and grandeur of virtue. And when they have raised it to the heavens, in the way habitual to men who have a fine flow of eloquence, it is easy to trample all else under foot and despise it in comparison with virtue; for it is not allowable for men who say that renown must be sought at the cost of pain to deny that those who had attained their aim are happy; for though they are involved in certain evils, yet this term of happiness has a wide and far-reaching meaning.</p>
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/> For as commerce is termed profitable and <pb n="515"/> farming productive, not if the one always escapes all loss, the other always escapes all damage from bad weather, but if in the main there is in each a good margin of prosperity; so life can be termed happy, not only if it is brimful of good things of every sort, but if in the main and on the weightier side there is a marked preponderance of good.</p>

The opinion of Callipho and Diodorus will be the same, both of whom so warmly espouse rectitude that all things that have not got it must, they hold, be ranked a long way behind it. The rest do seem to be in somewhat of a strait, still they manage to swim their way out-Epicurus, Hieronymus, and any who are found to care to support poor deserted Carneades.

For take the things which make men desire money to provide the means for love, for ambition, for their daily expenditure-as he is far removed from all such things, why should he feel much need of money or rather why should he trouble about it at all? Was it possible for a Scythian like Anacharsis to think nothing of money; has it been impossible for philosophers of a country like ours? There is on record a letter of his in these terms:<ref n="517.4">4</ref> "Anacharsis to Hanno greeting. My clothing is a Scythian mantle, my shoes the thick skin of the soles of my feet, my bed is the earth, hunger my relish; I live on milk, cheese, flesh. You may come to me therefore as to one at peace; but as for the gifts you delight in, present them to your fellow citizens or to the immortal gods."</p>

        <p>When a great quantity of gold and silver was being carried in a procession, Socrates said, "How much there is I do not need!"<ref n="519.1">1</ref> When ambassadors brought fifty talents to Xenocrates<ref n="519.2">2</ref> from Alexander, a very large sum for those days, particularly at Athens, he carried off the ambassadors to sup with him in the Academy and put before them just enough to be sufficient, without any display. On their asking him next day to whom he required them to count out the money: "What?" he said, "Did not yesterday's pot-luck show you that I have no need of money?” And when he saw their faces fall he accepted thirty minas to avoid appearing scornful of the king's generosity.</p>

        <p>But Diogenes,<ref n="519.3">3</ref> certainly, was more outspoken, in his quality of Cynic, when Alexander asked him to name anything he wanted: "Just now," said he, "stand a bit away from the sun!"<ref n="519.4">4</ref> Alexander apparently had interfered with his basking in the heat. And in fact Diogenes, to show how far superior he was to the King of Persia in the conditions of his life, used to argue that while he had no needs, nothing would ever be enough for the king; he did not miss the pleasures with which the king could never be sated, the king could never enjoy the pleasures of the philosopher.</p>

        <p>At this point his disciples enter on a long argument, and those pleasures which belong to kinds they despise they belittle in detail, yet all the same look out for a plentiful supply of all them.<ref n="521.2">2</ref> For lewd pleasures upon which they dwell at length are, they say, easy to satisfy, general, within reach of all, and should nature demand them, the standard of value should, they think, not be birth, position or rank, but beauty, age, shape, and abstinence is by no means difficult at the call of either health or duty or reputation, and in general this kind of pleasures is desirable, should there be no obstacle, but is never of benefit.<ref n="521.3">3</ref></p>

        <p>The whole teaching of Epicurus about pleasure is that pleasure is, he thinks, always to be wished and sought for in and for itself because it is pleasure, and that on the same principle pain is always to be avoided for the simple reason that it is pain, and so the wise man will employ a system of counterbalancing which enables him both to avoid pleasure, should it be likely to ensure greater pain, and submit to pain where it ensures greater pleasure;</p>

        <p>and for this reason while the body feels delight for the time that it has the sensation of present pleasure, it is the soul which has both the realization of present pleasure conjointly with the body and anticipates coming pleasure, and does not suffer past pleasure to slip away: thus the wise man will always have an unbroken tissue of pleasures, as the expectation of pleasures hoped for is combined with the recollection of pleasures already realized.</p>

For who does not see that need is the seasoning for all such things? When Darius<ref n="523.2">2</ref> in his flight drank muddy water polluted by corpses he said he had never had a more delightful drink; obviously he had never before been thirsty when he drank. And Ptolemy<ref n="523.3">3</ref> had never been hungry when he ate for when he was on a progress through Egypt and was parted from his escort and given coarse bread in a cottage, it seemed to him that nothing was more delightful than this bread. Socrates, it is said, would walk hard till evening, and when he was asked in consequence why he did so, he replied that by walking he was getting hunger as a relish to make a better dinner.<ref n="523.4">4</ref></p>

        <p>Again! do we not know of the fare put before the Lacedaemonians at their public meals? When the tyrant Dionysius<ref n="525.1">1</ref> dined with them he said that the black broth<ref n="525.2">2</ref> which was the staple of the meal was not to his taste; whereupon the cook who had made it said: "No wonder; for you did not have the seasoning. "What is that, pray?" said the tyrant. "Toil in hunting, sweat, a run down to the Eurotas, hunger, thirst; for such things are the seasoning of the feasts of Lacedaemonians.”</p>

        <p>There are certain whole States, like the Lacedaemonians whom I mentioned a little while ago, which by the training of custom have learnt to take delight in frugal living. Xenophon in describing the food of the Persians<ref n="525.3">3</ref> says that they take nothing but cress with their bread. And yet, if nature should feel the need of something yet more savoury, what a quantity of things are provided by earth and trees in ready abundance and of excellent savour!

        <p>contrast with this, sweating, belching men stuffed with food like fatted oxen then you will understand that those who are hottest in pursuit of pleasure are furthest from catching it, and that the pleasantness of food lies in appetite, not in repletion.</p>
        <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/> Timotheus,<ref n="525.5">5</ref> who bore a great name at Athens and was a leading man in the State, after dining, we are told, with Plato and being much delighted with the entertainment, said, when he saw him next day: "Your dinners are indeed delightful, not only at the time, but on the following day as well." Why so? because we cannot make proper use of our minds when our stomachs are filled with meat and drink.</p>

        <p>There is a noble letter of Plato<ref n="527.1">1</ref> to the relatives of Dion which contains a passage written pretty nearly in these words: "On my arrival here I found no pleasure in the celebrated happy life, with all its fulness of Italian and Syracusan feasts; in having two rich meals<ref n="527.2">2</ref> a day and never passing the night alone, and all the other accompaniments of such a life in which no one will ever be rendered wise, far less indeed temperate.

        <p>What charm then can there be in the life where there is no prudence, no temperance? This shows us the mistake of Sardanapalus, the very wealthy king of Syria, who had carved upon his tomb the lines:
"All I have eaten and wantoned and pleasures of love I have tasted,
These I possess but have left all else of my riches behind me."<ref n="527.4">4</ref>
"What else," says Aristotle,<ref n="527.5">5</ref> "could one inscribe on the grave of an ox, not on that of a king?" He says that in death he possesses the things which even in life he possessed only for the moment of enjoyment.</p>

            cannot men of narrow means enjoy them better than those who have plenty? For there is abundant provision of all such things in our city in public places. And those who own them as private property do not see so many, and only on rare occasions when they visit their country seats; and there all the same they feel a prick of conscience when they remember how they got them.<ref n="529.1">1</ref> Time would fail me should I wish to maintain the cause of poverty; for the matter is evident and nature herself teaches us daily how few, how small her needs are, how cheaply satisfied.</p>

Beware lest the favour of the crowd and the glory we covet be more of a burden than a pleasure. Surely it was petty of my favourite Demosthenes to say he was delighted with the whispered remark of a poor woman carrying water, as is the custom in Greece, and whispering in her fellow's ear- "Here is the great Demosthenes!" What could be more petty? "Ah! but how consummate an orator!" Yes! but assuredly he had learnt how to speak before others, not to commune much with himself.</p>

        <p>It must be understood, therefore, that neither is popular glory to be coveted for its own sake nor is obscurity to be sorely feared.
