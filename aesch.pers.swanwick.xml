            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THIS drama, founded upon the Persian War, and produced only seven years after its termination (B.C. 472), is invested with peculiar interest, not only as the earliest Æschylean drama which has come down to us, but also as our earliest extant Greek history, the first recorded recitation of Herodotus having taken place at the great Panathenæa at Athens (B.C. 446). It exhibits, moreover, the same principles of dramatic art, and the same conceptions respecting the divine government which characterise the purely imaginative productions of the "warrior-bard." For its full appreciation we must endeavour to realise the magnitude of the struggle which it commemorates, together with the momentous consequences to Hellas and to the world which resulted from the Hellenic victory.</p>
            <p>About eighty years before the battle of Salamis (fought B.C. 480) the Persians had made their first appearance in history, when, under their leader, Cyrus, they overthrew the empire of the Medes (B.C. 559). Within this comparatively brief interval they had brought under subjection not only the native peoples of Asia, but also large areas of Europe and
             <pb n="194"/>
            Africa. At the time of our drama their empire extended southward over Egypt to Cyrenaica, while to the north it comprised Maritime Thrace, Pæonea, and apparently Macedonia, as far as the borders of Thessaly, besides nearly all the islands of the Ægean, north of Krete and east of Euboea. Their ambition expanded with their conquests, till, at length, they aspired to universal dominion. "The conquest of Greece was represented by Xerxes as carrying with it that of all Europe, so that the Persian empire would become coextensive with the Æther of Zeus, and the limits of the Sun's course."</p>
            <p>The idea upon which this colossal empire was based was that of the despotic force of personal will, involving obligation of universal personal service, especially in war. During the expedition of Xerxes the tributaries of the Persian king were virtually slaves, working under the lash, and driven on to the charge in battle with the scourge. The profound humiliation of the subject peoples is forcibly depicted by the Chorus, in the ode wherein they lament the overthrow of the Persian power (v. 586).</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in the heart of Hellas, a new phase of political life had been developed; Athens had thrown off the yoke of her tyrants, the Pisistratids, and the world saw, for the first time, a state composed of free and equal citizens. The revolution of Kleisthenes had established the principles of free speech and equal law, while as yet this new-born liberty had not degenerated into licence. Adverting to the Athenian con-
             <pb n="195"/>
            stitution at the time when the Persians made their attack on Hellas, Plato says, "Reverence was then our queen and mistress, and made us willing to live in obedience to the laws." The strength of patriotic sentiment generated by the new constitution inspired the amazing courage required in the Athenians to encounter the hitherto unconquered hosts of Persia; upon the plain of Marathon they triumphed, and their glorious victory arrested, for a time, the encroachments of the Persian king.</p>
            <p>His son Xerxes undertook to avenge the disaster which had befallen the Persian arms: after enormous preparations, he set forth on his expedition, at the head of an army composed of forty-six different nations, each with its distinct national costume and local leaders, while eight other nations furnished the fleet. Well might the contemporary world be overawed by the spectacle of so prodigious an armament, and regard the cause of Hellenic independence as desperate.</p>
            <p>The victory of Salamis shattered the power of the barbarians, and changed the destiny of the world.<lb/>
            " ' Let there be light!' said Liberty,<lb/>
            And, like sunrise from the sea,<lb/>
            Athens arose."</p>
            <p>In celebration of the victory thus achieved by struggling and triumphant freedom, and in honour of the city of Pallas, which had won immortal glory at Salamis, Æschylus composed his drama of "The Persians." It has been justly remarked that "Æschylus is the prophet of Greek tragedy." "A

            single episode, a single generation, was insufficient for the display of the dependence of life upon life, and the moral infinitude of action which it was his design to exhibit. Thus he habitually composed groups of three connected plays, which gave full scope for the development of thought and work."<ref n="196.1">*</ref></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we possess only the second member of the trilogy, which, consisting of three separate dramas, severally entitled, Phineus, The Persians, and Glaukos,<ref n="196.2">†</ref> appears to have been known among the ancients by the general name of "The Persians." To this trilogy was appended the Satyric drama of “Prometheus, the Fire-kindler." Though the second member of this trilogy is alone based upon history,
             <pb n="197"/>
            while the first and third, together with the Satyric drama, draw their materials from mythological sources, it appears almost certain that these apparently incongruous elements constituted together one grand poetic whole; the leading idea giving unity to the detached dramas being the struggle between Asia and Europe, which, originated in the dim ages of mythology, had at length culminated in the triumph of Hellas over the non-Hellenic races. In the same manner Herodotus has based his history upon the notion of a primeval enmity subsisting between the Hellenes and the nations of the East. This apparent incongruity vanishes when we remember that the contemporaries of Æschylus cherished the firmest belief in the existence of their legendary heroes, whose protection and assistance were continually invoked, while their appearance on the scene of action, with superhuman stature and imposing mien, was hailed as an omen of victory. Æschylus has, moreover, in the second member of the trilogy, so treated the events of contemporary history as to bring them into harmony with the occurrences of the mythical past, invested, as it was, in the popular imagination, with a halo of glory and sublimity. This was rendered possible by the remoteness of Persia, which was selected as the scene of the drama; by the gorgeous splendour which surrounded Oriental life; by the vastness of the armies assembled under the sceptre of the great king, together with the strangeness of the barbaric physiognomy and costume. "These, exaggerated to
             <pb n="198"/>
            still greater proportions in the popular imagination, produced an impression of dim and indefinite greatness, not unlike that in which the midst of time veiled the heroes of mythology."<ref n="198.1">*</ref></p>
            <p>Another feature of the Æschylean age is the importance attached to prophecy, which, as we learn from Herodotus, not unfrequently determined the judgments of men, both Greeks and Asiatics; which also we find employed by our poet as the most convenient link for connecting the separate members of his trilogies. Thus, in the Oresteia, the Agamemnon is connected with the Choephori through Cassandra's prophecy of the vengeance which was speedily to fall upon the guilty pair. If we turn now to the drama of "The Persians," we find the Ghost of Darius referring in the most emphatic manner to certain ancient oracles (v. 739), of which the calamities which had befallen the Persians were the recognised fulfilment. It has been remarked by Welcker that in this passage allusion is obviously made to something which had been brought before the minds of the spectators in the previous drama, and this hypothesis is confirmed by the prophetic character of Phineus, from whom the first member of the trilogy derives its name.</p>
            <p>Phineus is represented in mythological story as one of the sons of Agenor,<ref n="198.2">†</ref> the father of the beautiful Europa; and it is related of Agenor by Ovid, and other classical writers, that he sent forth his sons in quest of
             <pb n="199"/>
            their sister, whose abduction by Zeus was represented by Persian literati as the first act of the conflict between the Eastern and the Western world: this version of the Phineus legend would offer, as remarked by Gruppe, an obvious link of connection with the Persian war. There are other versions of the story which, notwithstanding some discrepancies as to the genealogy of Phineus, and the circumstances of his blindness, agree in investing him with the prophetic character, and in bringing him into connection with the Argonauts, the grand national adventurers of Hellas.</p>
            <p>In the single extant fragment of the Æschylean Phineus reference appears to be made to the Harpies: <quote xml:lang="grc">Καὶ ψευδόδειπνα πολλὰ μαργώσῃς γνάθου ἐρρυσίαζον στόματος ἐν πρώτῃ χαρᾷ.</quote> Phineus, according to the ancient legend, was delivered from the Harpies by the Boreades;<ref n="199.1">*</ref> and it is related by Apollonius (xi. 317) that, after his deliverance, he prophesied, and foretold to the Argonauts the successful issue of their enterprise. In accordance with the spirit of the age, which linked together the successive conflicts between Europe and Asia, the expedition of the Argonauts, with that of the Hellenes against Ilium, is associated, by Herodotus, with the Persian
             <pb n="200"/>
            war: Æschylus would probably give greater scope to the prophecies of Phineus, and would thus have an opportunity of carrying back the imagination of the audience to the traditionary commencement of the great struggle which had recently been brought to so glorious a termination. Thus, according to Welcker, the mythological drama of Phineus would form a kind of prophetic prelude to the historical drama of “The Persians."</p>
            <p>Reference has already been made to the tendency of Æschylus to group together a long series of events, having reference to some connecting principle. It might therefore excite surprise that, in treating so momentous a subject as the Persian war, he should have contented himself with celebrating the battle of Salamis alone, which, however glorious for Athens, left the fate of Hellas still undecided. This would be brought home with peculiar force to the Athenians who, only ten months after the retreat of Xerxes, had been obliged to migrate a second time to Salamis, while Athens became once more the head-quarters of their dreaded foe. The victory of Platea, which insured the final deliverance of Hellas, would therefore be regarded as second in importance only to Salamis. Moreover, in the drama of "The Persians," the ghost of Darius alludes to the battle-field of Platea on which the ruin of the Persian host was to be consummated, as the just punishment inflicted by Zeus upon their impiety and overweening thoughts.</p>
            <p>This prophecy alone would suggest the probability of
             <pb n="201"/>
            some reference being made to this important victory in the third member of the trilogy, the Glaukos Potnieus. According to popular tradition Glaukos was a fisherman, who became a marine demigod by eating of the divine life-giving herb sown by Kronos: one version of the legend represents him to have been one of the Argonauts, who, having fallen from his galley, suffered this transformation. The so-called grotto of Glaukos was situated near the little town of Anthedon in Bœotia: this marine deity, accompanied by strange monsters of the sea, was accustomed, once a year, to visit the surrounding coasts and islands, and there to prophesy impending calamity. His approach was anticipated by the fishermen, by whom he was held in peculiar veneration, who also offered sacrifice and prayers to avert the threatened woe. It is mentioned by Pausanias (ix. 22, 6), that what Pindar and Æschylus heard from the dwellers at Anthedon concerning this marine deity had furnished materials to both poets, and had sufficed to Æschylus for the creation of a drama. According to Welcker, the extant fragments of this drama seem to indicate that Glaukos describes a voyage which he made from Anthedon to Sicily. Passing the promontory of Euboea, the shore of Zeus Kenæus, and the tomb of the unhappy Lichas (frag. 27), he came to Rhegium (frag. 31, 189; Herm. p. 12), and arrived finally at Himera (frag. 28) in Sicily. In the neighbourhood of this city was fought the battle of Himera, on which occasion the Sicilian Hellenes repulsed the
             <pb n="202"/>
            Carthaginian invaders, whose attack took place simultaneously with that of Xerxes upon Hellas. It is hardly to be supposed that Æschylus would introduce into his drama the name of Himera without commemorating a victory, which his contemporary, Pindar (Pyth. i. 152), represents as not inferior in importance to those of Salamis and Platea, the circumstances of which also were peculiarly susceptible of poetic treatment. The Bœotian sea-god, moreover, would form the most appropriate herald of the Bœotian victory, and thus, in his third drama, Æschylus would have the opportunity of bringing the battles of Himera and Platea into connection with that of Salamis, which formed the main feature in the Persian trilogy.</p>
            <p>The plastic art of the Hellenes illustrates their tendency to regard the successive victories of Hellas over Oriental barbarism as phases of the great struggle between the higher and lower elements of civilization, which formed so prominent a feature in their mythology. Thus, in the temple of Hera, at Mycenæ (Paus. xi. 17, 3), and in that of Zeus at Agrigentum (Diod. xi. 82), the capture of Ilium was associated with the overthrow of the giants by the Olympian gods.<ref n="202.1">*</ref> Their recent splendid victories would doubtless be similarly regarded by them as the ultimate triumph of civilization over barbarism, brought about by the intervention of the higher powers. This conception has found artistic expression in the beautiful painting on the so-called Darius vase, “ on which the celestial
             <pb n="203"/>
            deities are represented as consoling the terrified Hellas in face of the threatening purposes and preparations of the mighty king of Asia." Moreover, "out of the gigantic block of Persian marble at Rhamnus, three leagues from Marathon, which the Persians are said to have intended for a trophy, Phidias (also a prophet) created one of the most sublime of the Greek statues of the gods, that of Nemesis, whose stern form and gesture admonished the Greeks: ' Be not lifted up; to God alone belongs the glory!'"<ref n="203.1">*</ref></p>
            <p>It may be remarked, in conclusion, that this drama, by the profound humiliation of Xerxes, strikingly enforces the Hellenic principle that the supreme intelligence, which Æschylus invariably identifies with the will of Zeus, cannot suffer any inferior power, human or divine, to overpass its legitimate limits, and thus interfere with the harmonious working of the whole. At the same time the dignity of the Persian empire is vindicated by the description of the glorious and happy life which the Persians enjoyed under the rule of Darius, which had been forfeited by their impiety in acting in opposition to the divine decrees; moreover, by introducing the ghost of the mighty king, not only as the stern rebuker of his son's overweening pride, but also as deprecating in the most emphatic manner any subsequent invasion of Hellas, we see, in this early historical drama, an approach to the great principle of classical dramatic art, which finds its
             <pb n="204"/>
            perfect fulfilment in the Oresteian trilogy, namely, the final re-establishment of harmony between the contending powers whose collision has formed the main action of the drama.</p>
            <p>The Satyric drama, which invariably followed the trilogy, was a relic of the original dithyrambic chorus sung at the festival of Dionysos by groups of Satyrs who followed the chariot of the vintage-god; it was probably intended to relieve the serious impression produced by the tragedy, and to furnish amusement to the populace. It is doubtful whether these Satyric pieces were ever in such organic connection with the three dramas which they followed as to justify calling them a tetralogy; the significance of the "Prometheus,” as the concluding member of "The Persians," must however be admitted. Welcker has shown that we must distinguish between "Prometheus the fire-bringer," and "Prometheus the fire-kindler;" the latter being the title of the Satyric drama in question, which he maintains had reference to the establishment of the Promethea, the torch-race, at Athens, an artisan festival of which Prometheus was regarded as the founder. The kindling of the sacred fire might well be hailed as the symbol not only of victory, but also of the brighter day which had just dawned for the Hellenic race; while the association of the poorer classes, by the introduction of their favourite festival, would impart to the drama a peculiarly popular character, and render it the appropriate expression of the national enthusiasm.</p>

Fragments, however, exist of another Æschylean drama, entitled Glaukos Pontios, and various arguments are adduced by Welcker and Gruppe to prove that this drama, rather than the Glaukos Potnieus, formed the third member of the Persian trilogy. This view is supported by W. v. Humboldt, Schlegel, K. O. Müller, and other learned men. It seems, I confess, hard to understand why the error should have been made on several different occasions by several different writers. The principal reason for regarding Glaukos Potnieus as wrong seems to be the difficulty of discovering any link of connection between that legendary hero, the father of Bellerophontes, and the termination of the Persian war.

    <l>That when the gloom of dusky night set in,</l>
    <l n="360">The Hellenès would not stay, but, springing straight</l>

    <l>Their squadrons they should marshal in three lines,</l>
    <l>Guarding the outlets and the billowy straits,</l>

    <l>Finding by stealth an outlet for their ships,</l>
    <l>Stern was the warning,-every head should fall.—<ref n="224.1">*</ref></l>

    <l>Obedient to command, their meal prepared,</l>
    <l>And round true-fitting lock each mariner</l>
    <l>Strapp'd well his oar. But when the sunlight waned</l>

    <l>Went to his ship, and each one versed in arms;</l>
    <l>Of the long galleys line still cheering line,</l>
    <l>Forth sail they, as to each had been prescribed.</l>
    <l>And through the live-long night the admirals,</l>
    <l>With naval force entire, cruised to and fro.</l>
    <l>Darkness advanced, yet not in secret flight</l>
    <l>Ionia's host was minded to escape;</l>
    <l>But when white-steeded Day, bright to behold,</l>
    <l>Held the wide earth, from the Hellenes first,</l>
    <l n="390">Like joyous chant, rang out their battle-cry,</l>
    <l>And forthwith Echo, from the island rocks,</l>
    <l>Sent back responsive an inspiring shout.</l>
    <l>On all the Persians, cheated in their hopes,</l>
    <l>Fell terror; for by no means as in flight</l>
    <l>Their solemn pæan did th' Hellenes sing,</l>
    <l>But with stout courage speeding to the fray.</l>
    <pb n="225"/>
    <l>The trumpet's blare fired all their ranks, and straight,</l>
    <l>With simultaneous dip of sounding oar,</l>
    <l>They at the signal smote the surging brine,</l>
    <l n="400">And instant all conspicuous were to sight.</l>
    <l>First the right wing, well marshall'd, took the lead:</l>
    <l>Then their whole naval force in fair array</l>
    <l>Bore down against us. All at once was heard</l>
    <l>A mighty shout: "Sons of Hellenès, on,</l>
    <l>Your country free, your children free, your wives,</l>
    <l>The temples of your fathers' deities,</l>
    <l>Your tombs ancestral; for your all ye fight."</l>
    <l>And from our side clamour of Persian speech</l>
    <l>In answer rose; no time was then for pause,</l>
    <l n="410">But instant galley against galley dashed</l>
    <l>Her armature of brass. A ship of Hellas</l>
    <l>Led the encounter, and from Punic barque</l>
    <l>Sheared her high crest. Thereon as fortune led,</l>
    <l>Ship drave on ship; at first the Persian host,</l>
    <l>A mighty flood, made head; but soon their ships</l>
    <l>Thronged in the strait, of mutual aid bereft,</l>
    <l>Each against other dashed with brazen beak,</l>
    <l>Crushing the oar-banks of their proper fleet;</l>
    <l>While the Hellenès ships, not without skill,</l>
    <l n="420">Circling around them smote: dead hulks of ships</l>
    <l>Floated keel-upwards, and, with wrecks o'erstrewn</l>
    <l>And slaughtered men, lost was the sea from sight,</l>
    <l>Ay, shores and reefs were crowded with the dead.</l>
    <l>In flight disordered every ship was rowed,</l>

    <l>With splint of oar, or fragment from the wreck,</l>

They have been supposed to refer to the ebbing and flowing surface of the tide; to the two opposite shores of the strait; to the twofold surface of land and sea; to fragments of wrecked ships, &amp;c. The word <quote xml:lang="grc">δίπλαξ</quote> is however known in Homer as a double cloak (cloak with cape), and in the context most probably refers to the floating mantles of the slain.</note>

<note xml:id="ftn222.1" n="222.1" place="bottom">* The combined fleet which had now got together at Salamis consisted of 366 ships. ... We may doubt, however, whether this total, borrowed from Herodotus, be not larger than that which actually fought a little afterwards at the battle of Salamis, and which Æschylus gives decidedly as consisting of 300 sail, in addition to ten prime and chosen ships. That great poet, himself one of the combatants, and speaking in a drama represented only seven years after the battle, is better authority on the point even than Herodotus.—GROTE'S History of Greece.</note>
<note xml:id="ftn222.2" n="222.2" place="bottom">† The sufferings endured by the Athenians in consequence of the Persian occupation of Attica, when the temples of the Acropolis were pillaged, and all its buildings, sacred as well as profane, were consigned to the flames, were so recent and terrible, that any direct allusion to them would have jarred upon the feelings of a large portion of the audience. We cannot but admire the skill of the poet in evading the question which he attributes to the Persian queen.</note>
<note xml:id="ftn223.1" n="223.1" place="bottom">* Allusion is here made to the desperate stratagem of Themistoklês, by which he thwarted the resolution of the Grecian leaders to remove the fleet to the Isthmus, a resolution which, if taken, would have involved the ruin of the Hellenic cause.</note>
<note xml:id="ftn224.1" n="224.1" place="bottom">* In illustration of this command, reference may be made to the wrath of Xerxes when apprised of the destruction of the first bridge of boats thrown over the Hellespont, when he caused the heads of the chief engineers to be struck off.</note>

<note xml:id="ftn250.1" n="250.1" place="bottom">* <quote xml:lang="grc">κερσάμενος</quote>. Blomfield says, with reference to this word, "Interpreters render it, 'having devastated.' But I have nowhere met <quote xml:lang="grc">κείρομαι</quote> in the middle voice, except to mean, shear the locks in sign of grief.”</note>
<note xml:id="ftn250.2" n="250.2" place="bottom">† Hermann admits the conjecture of Pauw and Heath, <quote xml:lang="grc">μυχίαν πλάκα</quote>.—Paley.</note>
<note xml:id="ftn257.1" n="257.1" place="bottom">* <quote xml:lang="grc">ψάλλε</quote>. I do not venture to give the literal translation, twang. It seems impossible to peruse the close of this drama without recognizing that the poet's aim was no longer tragedy. He evidently wishes to gratify his Athenian spectators by the grief of the Persians, which he holds up to contempt.</note>
