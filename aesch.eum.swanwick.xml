            <l>Gaia, primeval prophetess;-and next,</l>
            <l>Themis, who second, as tradition tells,</l>
            <l>Upon her mother's seat was here enthroned;</l>
            <l>With her good will, nor in despite of any,</l>
            <l>Another child of Earth, Titanian Phoebe,</l>
            <l>Third by decree of Fate, assumed this seat;</l>
            <l>She as a birth-day gift to Phobos gave it,</l>
            <l>And hence his name to Phoebe is allied.</l>

            <l>Him onward speed, and mightily adore,</l>
            <l>Hephæstos' sons, road-fashioners, who tame</l>
            <l>The savage earth. The god, established here,</l>
            <l>Highly is honoured by the native tribe,</l>
            <l>And by King Delphos, steersman of this land.</l>
            <l>Zeus with prophetic lore his heart inspired,</l>
            <l>And throned him on this sacred seat, fourth seer;</l>
            <l n="20">So Loxias<ref n="142.1">*</ref> now is prophet of his sire.</l>

            <l>Kindly to birds, and haunt of deities.</l>
            <l>There Bromios, well I wis, the region holds,</l>
            <l>Since with his Thyads thence the god made war,</l>

          <p>Things dire to tell, direful for eyes to see,</p>
          <p>Have forced me from the fane of Loxias,</p>
          <p>So that no strength I have, no power to move;</p>
          <p>But lacking speed of limb, with hands I run;</p>
          <p>For age, when scared, is nought; a very child.</p>
          <p>Towards the wreath-encircled nook I creep,</p>
          <p><milestone unit="line" n="40"/>And at earth's navel-stone, behold a man</p>
          <p>Defiled before the gods, as suppliant,</p>
          <p>Holding his seat;—his hands still dripping gore,</p>
          <p>His sword new-drawn, his lofty olive-branch</p>
          <p>With ample fillets piously enwreathed,</p>
          <p>White bands of wool;-for so I speak it plain.</p>
          <p>But lo! before this man, on seats reclined,</p>
          <p>A wondrous company of women sleeps;</p>
          <p>Women? nay, Gorgons let me say; nor yet</p>
          <p>To Gorgonean types compare I them.</p>
          <p>Ere now in paintings [Harpies] I have seen,</p>
          <p><milestone unit="line" n="50"/>Snatching the meal of Phineus. These to sight</p>
          <p>Are wingless, black, and loathsome utterly.</p>
          <p>With breathings unapproachable they snore,</p>
          <p>Forth from their eyes drippeth a loathsome rheum;</p>
          <p>Their garb too vile the effigies to touch</p>
          <p>Of gods immortal, or the roofs of men.</p>
          <p>Tribe of this sisterhood I ne'er have seen;</p>
          <p>Neither may region boast such brood to rear</p>
          <pb n="144"/>
          <p>Scathless, unvisited by penance-throe.</p>
          <p>But for the issue, let lord Loxias,</p>
          <p><milestone unit="line" n="60"/>Mighty, who rules these seats, himself provide;</p>
          <p>For prophet-leech, and portent-seer is he,</p>

             <note n="141.1">* In a passage of deep significance Æschylus traces the successive steps in the history of Revelation, as it passed from the Chthonian (earthly) to the Olympian powers. Earth herself was the first prophet. In the simplest phenomena of nature she first spoke to men of the divine character and will. As time went on she gave place to "Right" (Themis), a daughter who was born to her; for the teaching of society and life carries us forward in the knowledge of God. "Right" in turn gave place to a younger sister, Phoebe, the embodiment of light, the symbol of spiritual intelligence. With her ministry the office of the earthly powers was fulfilled, and she transferred her charge, not by claim of succession, but as a voluntary offering, to the bright God of heaven, Phoebus, who himself adopted her name for his own.- Brook F.
