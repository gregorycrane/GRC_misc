        <head>PREFACE TO THE TRILOGY.</head>
        <p>Ir has been truly remarked by Shelley, <q>that the jury
        which sits in judgment upon a poet must be composed
        of his peers; it must be empanelled by time from the
        selectest of the wise of many generations.</q> By the
        verdict of this august tribunal, Aeschylus takes rank
        with Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, and may justly
        be regarded as one of <q>the unacknowledged legislators
        of the world.</q></p>
        <p>As it may appear presumptuous to offer to the public
        a new translation of the Aeschylean trilogy, the
        grandest dramatic work of classical antiquity, I may
        perhaps be allowed to state that I have not entered
        upon the task altogether uninvited. On the publication
of my translation of <title>Faust</title>, and the other masterworks
of Goethe, in Bohn's Standard Library, I was
        strongly urged by the late Baron Bunsen to undertake
        the translation of the Greek dramas. I felt honoured
        by the proposal; and though I was not immediately
        impelled to act upon the suggestion, his words have
        dwelt in my memory, and have encouraged me to complete
an arduous and very difficult undertaking.</p>
        <p>Considerable diversity of opinion prevails respecting
        the propriety of employing rhymed metres as substitutes for the complex forms of classical poetry;

        <pb n="viii" xml:id="p16"/>
        
        
        hence it may not be inexpedient briefly to state my
        reasons for adopting them, as affording in my judgment
        the only adequate vehicle for reproducing the choral
        odes of the Greek dramas.</p>
        <p>With regard to the principles which should guide
        the translator in the execution of his task, it is, I
        believe, universally recognized that a translation ought,
        as faithfully as possible, to reflect the original, both in
        spirit and in form, and that any wilful or unacknowledged
deviation from it is tantamount to a breach of
        trust. The difficulty of rigidly applying these principles
to the translation of the choral odes will be
        apparent when we remember that the medium through
        which the thought of the ancient poet has to be re-embodied differs so essentially from that of the original
        as to render the principle of imitation, with reference
        to their musical intonations, inapplicable. The futility
        of attempting to imitate the forms of classical poetry
        in a language the metres of which are governed not by
        Time, but by Accent, has been pointed out by
        Professor Newman, in the preface to his admirable
        translation of the <title>Iliad</title>, the excellence of which can
        only be fully appreciated by a careful comparison with
        the original.</p>
        <p><quote>An accented metre,</quote> he says, <quote>in a language
        loaded with consonants cannot have the same sort of
        sounding beauty as a quantitative metre in a highly
        vocalized language. It is not audible sameness of
        metre, but a likeness of moral genius which is to be

        <pb n="ix" xml:id="p17"/>
        
        
        aimed at.</quote> The translator, having thus no authoritative
models to necessitate the adoption of particular
        forms, is at liberty, without incurring the charge of
        unfaithfulness, to adopt those metres, rhymed or
        unrhymed, which approve themselves to his judgment
        as most in harmony with the spirit of the original.
        In order to fulfil this condition, however, he must take
        into consideration the highly lyrical character of the
        choral odes, which associated themselves not only with
        music, but also with the choral dance.</p>
        <p>Now, this lyrical element of ancient poetry, not
        admitting of translation, requires to be born anew, and
        for this purpose we have a most felicitous adjunct in
        rhyme, which, when judiciously employed, may be
        regarded as a musical accompaniment, pervading the
        choral harmonies, enhancing their beauty, and at the
        same time serving to mark the time.</p>
        <p>The only possible objection to the use of an ornament
        so attractive and significant, and at the same time so
        conformable to the English language, is the notion,
        very generally entertained, that <q>the exigencies of
        rhyme forbid faithfulness.</q> Holding fidelity to the
        spirit of the original to be the cardinal virtue of a
        translator, I should, if this opinion were well founded,
        abandon rhyme without hesitation. It appears to me,
        however, that the objection is overstated, and that it is
        better to aim at the true lyrical ideal, however difficult
        of realization. The solution of the problem can only
        be worked out by experience. How far I have
        succeeded in combining scrupulous fidelity to the
        

        <pb n="x" xml:id="p18"/>
        
        
     with the employment of rhyme, it is not for
        me to judge; metrical translation must always be a
        matter of compromise, and no one can be so sensitively
        aware of the shortcomings of a translation as the
        translator.</p>
        <p>My desire to bespeak for the dramas of Aeschylus
        that intelligent study which is essential for their true
        appreciation has induced me to attempt in my introduction
a very slight sketch of the progress of religious
        thought, as manifested through a few of the great
        master-works of literature and art. Poets are representative
men; and poetry, under its higher aspects,
        may justly be regarded as the fairest flower of the age
        and country which gave it birth, drawing its nourishment
from the deepest roots of national life, and concealing
beneath its delicate petals the germs of the
        future. Hence every great poem requires for its
        elucidation, not only to be studied in connection with
        contemporaneous history, but also to be brought into
        comparison with the kindred productions of other
        ages and nations. New insight is thus gained into
        the developments of history, and the tendencies of
        modern thought are more clearly interpreted when
        brought face to face with the conceptions and aspirations
of the old pagan world. If a complete history
        of religious development were to be given, it would of
        course be necessary to go back to the prior Monotheism
        which probably preceded the earliest Pantheistic natureworship
of which we have any record, and also to
        investigate the links of transition from the Vedic

        <pb n="xi" xml:id="p19"/>
        
        
        Divinities to the ideal Personalities of Olympus. Such
        an inquiry would, however, exceed the scope of an
        introduction.</p>
        <p>In considering the Zeus of Aschylus I have confined
myself almost entirely to the conception of the
        Olympian king embodied in the <title>Oresteia</title>, leaving
        untouched the apparent discrepancy between the
        character there portrayed and that depicted in the
        <title>Prometheus Bound</title>. I agree with those critics who
        believe that the discrepancy is only apparent, and
        would vanish had we the opportunity of studying the
        other members of the Promethean trilogy. Critics
        are agreed that the <title>Suppliants</title> ought also to be
        regarded as a member of a trilogy, in association with
        the lost dramas of the <title>Aegyptii</title> and the <title>Danaïdes</title>.
        These fragmentary works can, I believe, be only
        satisfactorily interpreted when studied in connection
        with the <title>Oresteia</title>. The investigation would, however,
        necessitate a reference to the remaining dramas of
        Aeschylus, and must therefore be postponed to a future
        opportunity.</p>
        <p>All true lovers of Art, who recognize her legitimate
        function as a revealer of truth, a mediator between the
        Finite and the Infinite, cannot fail to regret the subordinate
position to which she is condemned in the present
day, when she is too often regarded in the light of
        a mere elegant superfluity, as one of the costly adjuncts
        of our modern civilization. The true dignity of art
        has been nobly vindicated by Hegel in his celebrated
        work, entitled <title>Vorlesungen über die Aesthetik</title>. As

        <pb n="xii" xml:id="p20"/>
        
        
        this work is, I believe, comparatively little known in
        England, I have ventured to recast, with some modifications,
a few of his leading ideas, and to embody
        them in my introduction. I refer more especially to
        his analysis of the Greek dramas, and to his exposition
        of the fundamental ideas which characterize the three
        great eras-the symbolical, classical, and romanticwhich
mark alike the history of religion and of art. I
        have also availed myself of C. O. Müller's admirable
        dissertations on <q>the <title>Eumenides</title>,</q> together with Professor
Max Müller's lectures on language, second
        series, and his history of ancient Sanscrit literature.</p>
        <p>With regard to mythological lore, I am chiefly indebted
to Welcker's <title>Griechische Götterlehre</title>, Kuhn's
        <title>Herabkunft des Feuers</title>, and also to Guigniant's
        <title>Religions de l'Antiquité</title>, translated from the German
        of Creuzer.</p>

          <p>My friend the translator wishing to obviate the charge of arbitrarily departing from Aeschylus, requests me to draw up a list of the conjectural emendations of the text which I have suggested. Space forbids my here justifying them. I will state them as briefly as I can. F. W. N.</p>

          <p><label>10, 11.</label> Read <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίζει</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίζω</quote>, and retain the infinitive <quote xml:lang="grc">κρατεῖν</quote>. Then <quote xml:lang="grc">κέαρ</quote> is nominative, and <quote xml:lang="grc">ὧδε κρατεῖν</quote> refers to the capture of Troy, <gloss>get such mastery.</gloss></p>

          <p>In 148 a nominative, expressive of Artemis, is deficient. I have changed <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπλοίας</quote>, which can hardly bear the epithet <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀντιπνόους</quote>, into <quote xml:lang="grc">Ἄγρεια</quote> (huntress).</p>
          <pb n="76"/>
          <p><label>164.</label> Read <quote xml:lang="grc">εὔξεται</quote> for the old <quote xml:lang="grc">λέξει</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐδεν εὔξεται πρὶν ὤν</quote>· “ will not vaunt that he was aught of yore.”</p>
          <p><label>175.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">δέ που</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">γέ που</quote>, and remove the stop after <quote xml:lang="grc">σωφρονεῖν</quote>. Join <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄκοντας</quote> with <quote xml:lang="grc">σωφρονεῖν</quote>, <quote xml:lang="grc">ἦλθε</quote> with <quote xml:lang="grc">βιαίως</quote>. “ And to men, loath to learn sobriety, there cometh forcibly a grace (I trow) of deities, who sit on holy bench.” The “ grace” is the painful wisdom learned by suffering.</p>
          <p><label>226.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">προνωπῆ</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">προνωπεῖς</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>233.</label> After <quote xml:lang="grc">γραφαῖς</quote> insert [<quote xml:lang="grc">ποικίλαις</quote>]. In the antistrophe do not omit <quote xml:lang="grc">προκλύειν</quote>, but for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">πῆ</quote>, and omit <quote xml:lang="grc">ἡ</quote> before <quote xml:lang="grc">λύσις</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">Τὸ μέλλον δὲ προκλύειν, πῆ γένοιτ' | ἂν λύσις, προχαιρέτω</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>278.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἰσχὺς</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">ὄσχας</quote> or <quote xml:lang="grc">ὄσχους</quote>, “ twigs” of flame ; suggested by <quote xml:lang="grc">πεύκη</quote>, the pine. In the corrupt <quote xml:lang="grc">πρὸς ἡδονὴν</quote> a verb is concealed, such as <quote xml:lang="grc">προήχμασεν</quote>, <quote xml:lang="grc">προήκρισεν</quote>, vibrated, perked forward. <quote xml:lang="grc">Προσήλασεν</quote> is possible, but was less likely to be corrupted than some rarer verb.</p>
          <p><label>299.</label> Before <quote xml:lang="grc">φλέγουσαν</quote> a whole line seems to be lost, such as [<quote xml:lang="grc">αὐγὴν κελεύουσ', ἀστραπαῖς εὐαγγέλοις</quote>] <quote xml:lang="grc">φλέγουσαν</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>327.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">ὡς δυσδαίμονες</quote> Blomfield well gave <quote xml:lang="grc">ὡς δ᾽ εὐδαίμονες</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>365.</label> Treading in Blomfield's steps, I attempt the corrupt passage thus—
            <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>πέφανται δ' † ἐγγενὴς</l>
<l>ἀτολμήτως "Αρη</l>
<l>πνεόντων, μεῖζον ἢ δικαίως.</l>
<l>φλεόντων δωμάτων ὑπερφεῦ,</l>
<l>† τόδ' οὔτε βέλτιστόν † ἐστ'</l>
<l>οὔτ᾽ ἀπήμαντον . . .</l></quote>
            (<quote xml:lang="grc">Τόδε</quote>, the fact of excessive abundance.)</p>
          <p><label>412.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>πάρεστι σιγὰς ἄτιμος ἀλοίδορος</l>
<l>ἅδιστος ἀφεμένων ἰδεῖν</l></quote>:
read (until we get something better)—
            <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>πάρεστι σιγὰ κατ᾽ οἴμους, ἀλοίδορος,</l>
<l>ταϊστ᾽ ἀφωμένων ἰδεῖν</l></quote>.</p>
          <pb n="77"/>
          <p>Join <quote xml:lang="grc">σιγὰ ἀφωμένων</quote>. “There is silence along (her) paths, while they grope to see things that cannot be seen.” I understand <quote xml:lang="grc">αφωμένων</quote> of Helen's <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁμηλικίη</quote>, her maids of honour. In antistrophe for <quote xml:lang="grc">Ελλάδος</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">Ελλᾶνος</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>541.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ λαχόντες</quote>, which is nonsense, read <quote xml:lang="grc">ὀλολύζοντες</quote>, οι <quote xml:lang="grc">οἰμώζοντες</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>741.</label> This very corrupt passage admits of an approximate sòlution, thus—
            <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>ὕβριν, τότ᾽ ἢ τόθ᾽, ὅτε τὸ κύριον μόλῃ,</l>
<l>† νεαροῖς † φανοῦσαν † τόκοισι</l>
<l>δαίμονα - παντομάχαν</l>
<l>ἀνίερον θράσος μελαι</l>
<l>νας μελάθροισιν "Ατας,</l>
<l>εἰδομέναν τοκεῦσιν.</l></quote>
            Vulgo, <quote xml:lang="grc">ἢ νὰ † φαόυς κότον | δαίμονά † τε † τὸν ἄμαχον ἀπόλεμον | ἀνίερον Θράσος "Ατης</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">θράσος "Ατης</quote> is put for <quote xml:lang="grc">θράσεια "Ατη</quote>, and <quote xml:lang="grc">εἰδομένη</quote>, fem., agrees with it. If <quote xml:lang="grc">μελαίνας</quote> is correct, it seems to mean “gloomy (funereal),” and is joined with the dative <quote xml:lang="grc">μελάθροις</quote>. Then the antistrophe is omitting <quote xml:lang="grc">βίον</quote> in 749, and reading <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔδεθλα</quote> with Dindorf, &amp;c.
            <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>τὰ χρυσόπαστα δ᾽ ἔδεθλα σὺν πίνῳ χερῶν</l>
<l>....</l>
<l>παλιντρόποις ὄμμασιν λιποῦσ᾽, Ὁσίαν προσέβα, . . . .</l></quote>
            (for vulg., <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅσια</quote>).</p>
          <p><label>776.</label> Adopting from Franke <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐκ θυσιῶν</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἑκούσιον</quote>, read also <quote xml:lang="grc">θρήσκοισι</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">θνήσκουσι</quote>, which cannot be right. Then, we get
            “ <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>θράσος ἐκ θυσιῶν</l>
<l>ἄνδρασι θρήσκοισι κομίζων.</l></quote> 
            “infusing into religious men confidence from the sacrifices.”</p>
          <p><label>844.</label> <quote xml:lang="grc">Πολλὴν . . . λέγω.</quote> Schutz, if I remember, regards the line as spurious, and with good reason. <quote xml:lang="grc">Πολλὴν ἄνωθεν</quote> has come from <quote xml:lang="grc">πολλὰς ἄνωθεν</quote> just above; and he imagines a commentator to have expounded the second Geryon to be Agamemnon : <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸν κάτω γὰρ οὐ λέγει ;</quote> “ for he does not mean the Geryon below.”</p>
          <pb n="78"/>
          <p><label>994.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα μοῖραν</quote>, which is nonsense, read <quote xml:lang="grc">μοῖρ᾽ ἄμοιρά μ'</quote> ; and compare <quote xml:lang="grc">νâες ἄναες</quote>, <quote xml:lang="grc">γάμος ἄγαμος</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>1095.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">μελαγκέρων</quote>, by all means read <quote xml:lang="grc">μελαγκρόκῳ</quote>, and for <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐν πέπλοισι</quote> perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐμπλακέντα</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>1443.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">πολύμναστον</quote> read (metri causa) <quote xml:lang="grc">πολυυμνατον</quote>, and after the word mark a hiatus of five lines. The antistrophic to <quote xml:lang="grc">πολυύμνατον</quote> is <quote xml:lang="grc">τίς ὁ θρηνήσων</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>1446.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">κράτος ἰσόψυχον</quote> (which is defective in metre as well as sense) read <quote xml:lang="grc">κράτος σινόψυχον</quote>, “thou establishest a soul-blighting sway by means of women.” Hermann by inserting <quote xml:lang="grc">τ'</quote> after <quote xml:lang="grc">κράτος</quote> did not improve the sense.</p>
          <p><label>1476.</label> Read, for the sense, <quote xml:lang="grc">εἶναί μ᾽ ἄλοχον [τοῦδ᾽ ὀλέτειραν]</quote>, also 1480, . . . <quote xml:lang="grc">τόνδ' ἀπέτισεν [φονίαισι δίκαις]</quote>. In antistrophe omit '<quote xml:lang="grc">Ipɩyévecav</quote> as a gloss, and read

            <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>τὴν πολύκλαυτον ἀνάξια δράσας,</l></quote>
            then strophe and antistrophe become commensurate. Perhaps in 1497 <quote xml:lang="grc">doλig</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">dovλí</quote>, and in 1501 <quote xml:lang="grc">δολίαν</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">δούλιον</quote>, which the argument from <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνελεύθερον</quote> seems to demand. (Indeed the metre of <quote xml:lang="grc">doλío</quote> in 1497 is not satisfactory.) Yet the argument of <quote xml:lang="grc">ovde yàp</quote> in 1501 remains obscure or strained.</p>
          <p><label>1610.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄξει</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔχθει</quote>, in contrast to <quote xml:lang="grc">χαρᾷ</quote>.</p>
          <p><label>1618.</label> For <quote xml:lang="grc">σειραφόρον</quote> read <quote xml:lang="grc">σειραφόρων</quote>: “ bands heavier than common harness.”</p>
