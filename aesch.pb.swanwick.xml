      </ab>
      <p>THE combat between the Titans and the Olympian Gods, issuing in the triumph of the latter, constitutes, as Hegel remarks, the central fact of Hellenic mythology. This hoary legend may be regarded as symbolizing in the physical universe the emergence of order out of chaos, while in the history of religious thought it marks a period of transition, characterized mainly by the metamorphosis of the nature-powers, the objects of men's earlier worship, into the humanized divinities of Hellas, involving the recognized supremacy of the higher over the lower elements of being.</p>
      <p>One phase of this struggle is treated by Æschylus in the drama of the Eumenides; there the hoary goddesses, the dark vengeance-powers of the primeval world, are brought into harmonious subordination to Pallas Athena, the impersonation of the wisdom and benignity of Zeus. Another aspect of the conflict formed the subject of the Promethean trilogy, which set forth the relation between the finite and the supreme will, in their antagonism and their reconciliation.</p>
      <p>Among the grand ideals bequeathed to the world by Hellenic genius there is none, perhaps, which has more deeply impressed the poetic imagination than the much-enduring<pb n="334"/> Titan; none, certainly, which has for a longer period coloured the stream of philosophic thought. The Promethean myth, it must be remembered, was not the invention of either Hesiod or Æschylus; its root, as Bunsen remarks, is older than the Hellenes themselves. Even at the present day, the legend, in its rudest form, may be traced among the Iranian tribes of the Caucasus, while in our western world it has inspired the genius of more than one great poet of modern times.</p>
      <p>The three dramas of which the trilogy consisted are believed to have been “Prometheus, the Fire-bringer,” "Prometheus Bound," and "Prometheus Unbound," of which the second has alone survived.<ref n="334.1">*</ref> Prometheus there appears as the champion and benefactor of mankind, whose condition, at the close of the Titanic age, is depicted as weak and miserable in the extreme:
      <quote>
         <l>“Seeing, they saw in vain;</l>
         <l>Hearing, they heard not; but like shapes in dreams,</l>
         <l>Through the long time all things at random mixed.”</l>
      </quote>
      </p>
      <p>Zeus, it is said, proposed to annihilate these puny ephemerals, and to plant upon the earth a new race in their stead. Prometheus represents himself as having frustrated this design, and as being consequently subjected, for the sake of mortals, to the most agonising pain, inflicted by the remorseless cruelty of Zeus. We <pb n="335"/> have thus the Titan, the symbol of finite reason and free will, depicted as the sublime philanthropist, while Zeus, the supreme deity of Hellas, is portrayed as the cruel and obdurate despot, a character peculiarly revolting to Athenian sentiment.</p>
      <p>The attempt to explain this apparent anomaly has given rise to a variety of theories and speculations. It is urged by some that at the time of Æschylus so sharp a line was drawn, in the minds of educated men, between religion and mythology, that the latter was accepted simply as poetical imagery, and was employed by the poet without any definite moral aim. Others imagine, with Welcker, that Æschylus, as a contemporary of Zenophanes, and one initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, maintained an antagonistic attitude towards the traditional creed, and that in the Promethean trilogy he seized the opportunity to enter his protest against it, by representing the head of the Olympian system under so revolting an aspect. It must be remembered, however, that the Athenian drama formed part of a solemn religious festival, celebrated by the entire population, and that the popular theology was intertwined with the national and political life not only of Athens, but of Hellas. The magnificent statues of Pallas Athena and of Olympian Zeus, executed at enormous cost by Phidias, the contemporary of Æschylus, were doubtless regarded by the multitudes assembled at the national festivals as symbols of divine and very awful realities; and if we turn to the remaining dramas of the poet we find his delineation of these divinities in harmony with <pb n="336"/> this conception. Zeus, more especially, is represented as uniting in himself the sublimest attributes of deity.</p>
      <p>The Chorus, in their solemn invocation (Ag. 160), lay peculiar stress upon the name of Zeus, as the supreme deity, the prime source of consolation and of wisdom. He is elsewhere portrayed as the almighty ruler (Sup. 795), who by ancient law directs destiny (Sup. 655), and without whose will nothing is accomplished for mortals (Sup. 804). He is invoked as king of kings, most blest among the blest, of powers on high most perfect power (Sup. 519). He is likewise apostrophised as father, creator, king, supreme artificer, wielding no delegated sway, and whose deed is prompt as his word to execute the designs of his deep-counselling mind (Sup. 587). He is the all-seeing father (Sup. 130); lord of ceaseless ages (Sup. 567); the guardian of the guest (Ag. 353); the punisher of overweening pride (Per. 822); the upholder of the righteous law of retribution (Ag. 154). Many more passages of a similar character might be adduced, from which it would appear that the poet, though not emancipated from the errors and limitations of Polytheism, had, nevertheless, risen to the sublime ideal of one supreme ruler, whose righteous will was identified with the eternal decrees of destiny. Instead of placing himself in antagonism with the popular religion, he seems rather, as the prophet of Polytheism, to have striven to elevate the popular conception of Zeus, and of the other Hellenic divinities, more especially Apollo and Pallas Athena, who are represented in the Oresteia as the <pb n="337"/> willing but subordinate executors of their father's will. It seems improbable that in the Promethean trilogy alone he should assume an attitude towards the popular religion utterly irreconcilable with the tendencies manifested in his remaining works; the apparent contradiction has doubtless arisen from the loss of the concluding drama. I agree with those critics who think that if we possessed it we should see the majesty of Zeus fully vindicated, and reconciliation established between the contending powers.</p>
      <p>As it seems unreasonable to accept, without qualification, the gross picture of Zeus as represented, in the extant drama, by his exasperated adversary, Prometheus, so we must look elsewhere for the true ground of the antagonism subsisting between him and the Olympian divinities, all of whom are arrayed against him. Though the Promethean myth, as related by Plato, in the “Protagoras," differs in many essential features from the version of Æschylus, yet the fundamental thought there embodied is so completely in harmony with the teaching of the prophet-bard, that it may be referred to as, perhaps, throwing light upon the moral significance of the trilogy. In the “Protagoras" a distinction is drawn between the wisdom which ministers to physical well-being, and political wisdom which enables men to live in organized communities. Prometheus is represented as having endowed men with the former, but as unable to invest them with the latter, which involved the exercise of justice, and was under the special guardianship of Zeus. Now it is this <pb n="338"/> quality of justice which was bestowed upon mortals by Zeus that Æschylus extols with peculiar emphasis. "Riches," he says, "afford no bulwark to him who spurns the mighty altar of justice" (Ag. 381); firm based is justice (Cho. 635); "all must perish who withstand her mandates" (Cho. 630). Justice is styled the daughter of Zeus (Cho. 934); reverence for her altar is characterized as the sum of wisdom (Eum. 510).</p>
      <p>It was, moreover, an idea familiar to the Æschylean age that all excellence was the gift of the gods, more especially of Zeus, and that it could not be obtained without their intervention. "God alone is good," sang Simonides; “no one wins virtue without the aid of the gods, neither a state nor an individual." "Zeus, the great virtues attend upon mortals from thee," sang Pindar; “and,” he adds, "prosperity lives longer with those who revere thee, but with perverse minds it does not equally abide, thriving for all time" (Isthm. Ode iii.) “Through the favour of God man blooms with a wise heart."<ref n="338.1">*</ref> "An untainted mind," according to Æschylus, is “heaven's first gift." The Chorus remind Prometheus of “the dreamlike feebleness that fetters the blind race of mortals" (Pro. 556); an expression which recalls Pindar's description of men as “the dream of a shadow;” “yet,” he adds, "when splendour given by the god comes to them, a brilliant light falls upon men and a sweet life" (Pyth. Ode viii. Epode 5). Not only was Prometheus unable to endow mortals <pb n="339"/> with these higher attributes; by conferring upon them benefits contrary to the will of Zeus, he, in fact, alienated them from the gods, in fellowship with whom, according to the Greek ideal, men found their highest well-being.</p>
      <p>He may thus be regarded as personifying that insurgent condition of the will which, blind to the perception of higher truth, is full of arrogant self-confidence and all-defying pride. In many respects he offers a parallel to Milton's Satan, "a creation requiring in its author almost the spiritual energy with which he invests the fallen Seraph." The Titan chained to his solitary rock, and the archangel prone upon the lake of fire, stand alone, the one in ancient, the other in modern literature, as stupendous examples of indomitable will; of both it may be said with truth that, "what chains us, as with a resistless spell, in such a character, is spiritual might made visible by the racking pains which it overpowers."<ref n="339.1">*</ref></p>
      <p>For the Titan, however, there is deliverance, and the extant fragments of the concluding member of the trilogy enable us to form some idea as to the agency by which it was accomplished. At the opening of the "Prometheus Unbound" the Titan was seen brought once more to light, after the lapse of ages, from the abyss into which he had been hurled at the conclusion of the “Prometheus Bound." He was still chained to the rock, with the additional torment of the eagle, which daily preyed upon his liver. The punishments <pb n="340"/> of the Titans, like the Titanic powers themselves, represent the absence of rule or measure; the restless insatiability of the lower passions and desires when, with self-asserting insolence, they bid defiance to the restraints of law. Under his prolonged torment the spirit of Prometheus is somewhat subdued; this change he himself prophesies in the previous drama (Pro. 520), where he says—
      <quote>
         <l>"By myriad pangs and woes</l>
         <l>Bowed down, thus shall I 'scape these bonds.”</l>
      </quote>
      </p>
      <p>We are here reminded of the poet's utterances respecting the discipline of suffering, which afford a clue to the significance of this feature of the legend—
      <quote>
         <l>"To sober thought Zeus paves the way,</l>
         <l>And wisdom links with pain.</l>
         <l>Against their will</l>
         <l>Rebellious men are tutored to be wise.”—(Ag. 170.)</l>
         <l>"Well-earned is wisdom at the cost of pain.”—(Eum. 499.)</l>
      </quote>
      </p>
      <p>The Chorus consisted of the twelve Titans, six male and six female personages, who, redeemed from Tartaros, visibly represent one of the two worlds whose strife and reconciliation formed the subject of the trilogy. The elementary forces of nature, personified as gods, must be defeated in order to assure dominion to a more spiritual order of divinities; but when the triumph of mind has been assured, the once rebellious nature-powers reappear, as beneficent but subordinate agents.<ref n="340.1">*</ref> <pb n="341"/></p>
      <p>They open the drama with an ode in which they describe the journey they have taken in order to pay Prometheus a visit of sympathy.</p>
      <p>In the well-known fragment translated by Cicero, Prometheus, in return, narrates his sufferings, describes the torment he endures from the eagle, and longs for death as the goal of his anguish.</p>
      <p>Herakles<ref n="341.1">*</ref> next appears upon the scene, and in him Prometheus recognizes his heaven-appointed deliverer. Nowhere are the noble and the repulsive features of Hellenic mythology more remarkably associated than in the numerous legends which gather round the person of Herakles. The fundamental idea embodied in this Zeus-born hero is, however, that of irresistible power, "whose action is as beneficent to the children of men as it is fatal to the enemies of light." The heroic deeds of Herakles are glorified by Pindar (Nem. i. 33, 34, 62-72), who also appeals to them as authenticating his divine vocation; while, according to the rhetorician Aristides, he was styled by men their saviour, the averter of evil. Nowhere, however, is he introduced in this character more significantly than as the liberator of Prometheus.</p>
      <p>According to Hellenic mythology,<ref n="341.2">†</ref> Herakles closed the line of heroes, the earth-born sons of Zeus, whose mission it was to ennoble and elevate the human race. He therefore exhibited the highest result of the fellowship<pb n="342"/> of Zeus with mortals, of which Io was one of the first recipients. Hence the significance of her appearance in the "Prometheus Bound." She, like the Titan, resisted the divine will, and, like him, must suffer the penalty of her rebellion; accordingly the account of her sufferings, as, wailing and distraught, she pursues her toilsome wanderings, serves to heighten the impression of the cruel tyranny of Zeus, which it is the object of that drama to produce.</p>
      <p>In “The Suppliants," however, Zeus appears in relation to Io, not as the obdurate tyrant, but as the beneficent deity, whose severest judgments issue in blessings to the individual and to mankind. Doubtless, under this aspect he would have been represented in the third member of the Promethean trilogy.</p>
      <p>Herakles inquires from Prometheus his way to the gardens of the Hesperides; the Titan, in reply, describes his journey thither, and announces the dangers which he will have to encounter. Forthwith the eagle appears, winging its flight towards Prometheus: Herakles utters the exclamation, “Archer Apollo, surely guide mine arrow,” draws his bow, and slays the pest.</p>
      <p>In what manner the subsequent liberation of Prometheus was effected we have no means of determining; whether Herakles himself unloosed his chains, or whether this was accomplished through the intervention of Hermes, or some other divinity; whether Herakles prevailed upon Zeus to accept Cheiron as a substitute for Prometheus, and whether Cheiron voluntarily <pb n="343"/> descended into Hades; and, finally, whether the Gods appeared upon the scene, to celebrate, with Prometheus and the Titans, the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis- these are questions to which neither the fragments themselves, nor the testimony of other witnesses, enable us to return a satisfactory answer, and I consequently abstain from entering upon them.</p>
      <p>The chief interest, however, centres in the mind of Prometheus, and upon the agency by which the arch-rebel was transformed into the willing subject and minister of Zeus. The spectacle of his brother and sister Titans and Titanesses redeemed from durance would tend to correct the false impression which had possessed his mind respecting the ruthless tyranny of Zeus, and consequently the gnawing desire to witness his humiliation would give place to the unreluctant recognition of his supremacy. He would accordingly no longer refuse to reveal the secret, upon the disclosure of which he, in his blindness, imagined the maintenance of that supremacy to depend.<ref n="343.1">*</ref> In Hesiod Zeus is represented as allowing himself to be apparently deceived by Prometheus, when he taught men to bring worthless offerings to the Gods; the Titan there appears as the trickster caught at last in his own wiles. That the reign of Zeus, whom the poet elsewhere extols as "The Lord of ceaseless ages," "Most blessed among the blest," should be conceived of by him as contingent upon the word of Prometheus, seems to me incredible. The voluntary revelation of his supposed <pb n="344"/> secret was the token that the all-defying rebel was transformed into the willing subject and minister of Zeus.</p>
      <p>It is related<ref n="344.1">*</ref> that Zeus, when he released Prometheus from his chains, required him, as a slight voluntary punishment, to bind his head with branches of the agnus-castus (<quote xml:lang="grc">λύγος</quote>), a plant frequently employed for religious purposes.</p>
      <p>The same symbolic signification was, in after times, attached to the ring of Prometheus, referred to by Catullus and Pliny. The former relates that when Prometheus appeared at the marriage festival of Peleus and Thetis, he wore a ring, as a slight token of his ancient punishment:
      <quote xml:lang="lat">
         <l>"Extenuata gerens veteris vestigia pœnæ;<ref n="344.2">†</ref></l>
         <l>Quam quondam silici restrictus membra catena</l>
         <l>Persolvit, pendens e verticibus præruptis.”</l>
      </quote>
      </p>
      <p>Not as an ornament, says Pliny (xxxiii. 4), has Prometheus worn the iron ring, but as a chain; and (xxxvii. 1), as a slight token of punishment, a piece of the rock to which he had been fastened was inserted in the ring instead of a gem.</p>
      <p>The iron finger-ring is not, like the lugos-crown, expressly referred back to Æschylus; the same signification, however, attaches to both, and it is not probable, <pb n="345"/> as Welcker remarks, that they should not have been associated in the ancient legend.</p>
      <p>Thus the dignity of man, of whom Prometheus may be regarded as the representative, is fully vindicated, when, instead of rebelling against the restraints of law, he joyfully accepts them, and finds his true liberty in obedience; thenceforth the crown, the token of submission, is transformed into an honourable adornment, and the iron ring becomes the symbol of a holy consecration.<ref n="345.1">*</ref></p>
      <p>Thus we may imagine was brought about the reconciliation of the powers whose antagonism formed the subject of the “Prometheus Bound." We cannot but admire the marvellous art with which the poet, while making his personages the representatives of certain abstract principles, at the same time endows them with life and sharply-defined individuality. This impression of reality is heightened in Prometheus by the allusion of the Chorus to his marriage with their sister Hesione. The chorus of colossal Titans, delivered at length from their mighty toils, and assisting at the deliverance of Prometheus, seems to me one of the grandest conceptions that ever entered a poet's mind. It harmonizes with the Æschylean conception of Zeus, as head of the Olympian hierarchy, reigning supreme in the domain of nature and of mind.</p>
      <p>In concluding this very inadequate study of a great subject, I will allude, in a few words, to the theory propounded by Professor Kuhn, with reference to the <pb n="346"/> Promethean myth.<ref n="346.1">*</ref> He considers the name of the Titan to be derived from the Sanscrit word <quote xml:lang="san">Pramantha</quote>, the instrument used for kindling fire. The root <quote xml:lang="san">mand</quote>, or <quote xml:lang="san">manth</quote>, implies rotatory motion, and the word <quote xml:lang="san">manthami</quote>, used to denote the process of fire-kindling, acquired the secondary sense of snatching away; hence we find another word of the same stock, <quote xml:lang="san">pramatha</quote>, signifying theft.</p>
      <p>The word <quote xml:lang="san">manthami</quote> passed into the Greek language, and became the verb <quote xml:lang="grc">manthanô</quote>, to learn; that is to say, to appropriate knowledge; whence <quote xml:lang="grc">prometheia</quote>, foreknowledge, forethought. Prometheus, the fire-bringer, is the <quote xml:lang="san">Pramantha</quote> personified, and finds his prototype in the Aryan Matarisvan, a divine or semi-divine personage, closely associated with Agni, the fire-god of the Vedas. We have thus another curious instance of the common elements which may be detected in the Vedic and Hellenic mythology, while the development of the Promethean myth affords an instructive illustration of the mode in which words, originally having reference to natural phenomena, gradually became invested with new and more spiritual significance when transplanted to the soil of Hellas.</p>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>PROMETHEUS</speaker>
<l>Grievous to me it is these things to tell,</l>
<l>Grief to be silent: trouble every way.</l>
<l>When first the heavenly powers were moved to rage,</l>
<l>And in opposing factions ranged their might,</l>
<l>These wishing Kronos from his seat to hurl</l>
<l>That Zeus forsooth might reign; these, counter-wise,<lb n="210"/></l>
<l>Resolved that o'er the gods Zeus ne'er should rule;</l>
<l>Then I with sagest counsel strove to move</l>
<l>The Titans, progeny of heaven and earth,</l>
<pb n="357"/>
<l>But strove in vain; for they, in stubborn souls</l>
<l>Of crafty wiles disdainful, thought by force,</l>
<l>An easy task, the mastery to gain.</l>
<l>But me, not once but oft, my mother Themis,</l>
<l>And Earth (one shape with many names) had told</l>
<l>Prophetic, how the future should be wrought.</l>
<l>That not by strength of thew or hardiment<lb n="220"/></l>
<l>Should mastery be compassed, but by guile;</l>
<l>But when this lore I did expound in words,</l>
<l>They deigned me not a single look; whereon,</l>
<l>Of courses free to choose, the wisest seemed</l>
<l>Leagued with my mother, of my own free will</l>
<l>The will of Zeus to meet, siding with him,</l>
<l>And by my counsels black-roofed Tartaros'</l>
<l>Murky abyss primeval Kronos now</l>
<l>Engulfs with his allies; such benefits</l>
<l>From me the tyrant of the gods received,<lb n="230"/></l>
<l>And hath requited with these base returns.</l>
<l>For, someway, cleaveth aye to tyranny</l>
<l>This fell disease; to have no faith in friends.</l>
<l>But touching which ye ask me, on what charge</l>
<l>He thus maltreats me; this will I make clear.</l>
<l>When seated on his father's throne, forthwith,</l>
<l>He to the several gods was dealing out</l>
<l>Their several honours, marshalling his realm;</l>
<l>But he of toil-worn mortals took no count;</l>
<l>The race entire he ardently desired<lb n="240"/></l>
<l>To quench, and plant a new one in its stead.</l>
<l>And none but I opposed his purposes;</l>
<l>I dared alone;—I saved the mortal race</l>
<pb n="358"/>
<l>From sinking blasted down to Hades' gloom.</l>
<l>For this by these dire tortures I am bent,</l>
<l>Grievous to suffer, piteous to behold.</l>
<l>I who did mortals pity, of like grace</l>
<l>Am deem'd unworthy, but am grimly thus</l>
<l>Tuned to his will, a sight of shame to Zeus.</l>

<l>Of will, free will, I erred, nor will gainsay it.</l>

              <ref n="360.1">*</ref> The word Arabia, with Xenophon, included Mesopotamia, as part of the land on which Arabs roam. My friend Professor Newman conjectures that Mardin, built on a limestone rock, which is said to be 2000 feet high, was the city <quote xml:lang="grc">ὑψίκρημνον</quote>, of which the poet had heard. The Arabs still roam up to the base of this little mountain. No Greek, in Æschylus's day, knew the geography of Courdistân; so it was natural to include the whole of the wonderful "Asiatic Switzerland " in Caucasos.

Mr. Paley, to whose note I must refer for the grounds of his hypothesis, identifies it with Mont Blanc. This seems, however, directly to contradict the poet's statement that Io, after crossing the Kimmerian Bosporos, travelled eastward on Asiatic ground.

The Arimaspi, with the Grypes, were, moreover, the recognised inhabitants of this gold region.

Arrian (vi. 1) mentions that Alexander the Great, when preparing to sail down the Indus (having seen crocodiles in the river Indus, and in no other river except the Nile ... ), seemed to himself to have discovered the sources of the Nile; as though the Nile, rising from some place in India, and flowing through much desert land, and thereby losing its name Indus, next. . . . flowed through inhabited land, being now called Nile by the Ethiopians of those parts, and afterwards by the Egyptians. Virgil, in the 4th Georgic, echoes the obsolete error.
