<s xml:id="sent1.1.1.6">Looking closely at our own land, Masakado in the Jōhei era, Sumitomo in the Tengyō era, Yoshichika in the Kōwa era, and Nobuyori in the Heiji era—these men were each proud in spirit and fierce in deed, yet regarding the lay priest of Rokuhara, the former Grand Minister of State Taira no Ason Kiyomori, his circumstances are such that neither mind nor words can adequately describe what has been transmitted and heard.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.1">However, when Tadamori was the Governor of Bizen, he built the Tokuchōju-in temple in fulfillment of the Retired Emperor Toba's vow, erecting a hall of thirty-three bays and placing one thousand and one Buddha images within.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.2">The dedication was on the thirteenth day of the third month of the first year of Tenshō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.3">As a reward, it was ordered that he be given a vacant province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.4">As the province of Tajima was open, he was given that.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.5">Because of the Retired Emperor's great admiration, he was permitted access to the Palace Courtiers' Hall.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.6">Tadamori first ascended to the Hall at the age of thirty-six.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.7">The people above the clouds [high courtiers] were jealous of this, and on the night of the twenty-third day of the eleventh month of that same year, during the Gosechi Toyonoakari festival, they plotted to ambush Tadamori in the dark.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.8">Tadamori heard of this and said, "I am not a civil official; I was born to a house of warriors. To meet with unexpected shame now would be a regret for my house and for myself.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.9">After all, there is a text that says one serves the lord by preserving one's life."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.10">saying this, he made preparations in advance.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.11">Before going to the palace, he prepared a large dagger and wore it casually beneath his court dress; turning toward the dimly lit area, he slowly drew this sword and held it to his sidelocks, where it appeared like ice.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.12">The onlookers stared wide-eyed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.13">Furthermore, among Tadamori's retainers was one called Sahyōe-no-jō Iesada, the son of Shin-no-Saburō Dayū Iefusa and grandson of Mokkō-no-suke Taira no Sadamitsu, who was originally of the same clan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.14">Wearing a light green belly-guard under a light blue hunting robe and holding a sword carrying a bowstring bag under his arm, he waited reverently in the small garden of the Courtiers' Hall.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.15">The Head Chamberlain and others were suspicious and had a Sixth Rank official ask, "Who is that wearing plain clothes waiting near the bell rope by the 'Quiver Pillar'?</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.16">This is outrageous behavior.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.17">Leave at once."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.18">Iesada replied, "I have heard that my hereditary lord, the Governor of Bizen, is to be ambushed in the dark tonight, so I am waiting here to see how that will unfold.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.19">I absolutely cannot leave."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.1.20">Because he waited there with such resolve, they must have thought it unwise, for there was no dark ambush that night.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.1">When Tadamori danced at the imperial command, the people changed the rhythm and jeered, "The Ise Heike is squint-eyed [sugame]!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.2"></s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.3">Although strictly speaking it is awe-inspiring to mention that these people are descendants of Emperor Kanmu, in recent times their residence in the capital had become unfamiliar, and they behaved entirely like provincials; having lived deep in Ise Province, people associated them with the vessels [su] of that province and called them the Ise Heike.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.4">Furthermore, because Tadamori's eyes were slanted [sugame], they jeered at him in this way.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.5">Without any way to respond, and before the entertainment had ended, he slipped away, handed the sword he had worn at his side to a palace servant to keep at the Shishinden, in a place where the other courtiers could see it, and left.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.6">Iesada was waiting for him and asked, "Well, how did it go?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.7">Although Tadamori wanted to tell him, he thought that if he spoke, Iesada was the kind of man who would immediately slash his way up into the Hall, so he replied, "Nothing in particular happened."</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.2.8"></s>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.1">At the Gosechi festival, people only sing about amusing things like "White thin paper, crumpled paper, roll-top brush, brush shaft painted with comma designs," but in recent times there was a man named Dazai-no-Gon-no-Sotsu Suenaka-kyō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.2">Because his complexion was very dark, people called him the Black Sotsu.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.3">When that person was still the Head Chamberlain and danced at the Gosechi, they changed the rhythm and jeered, "Oh how black, black, what a black head.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.4">What kind of person lacquered him?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.5"></s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.6">Also, when the former Grand Minister of State Lord Tadamasa of the Kazan-in family was still ten years old, having lost his father, the Middle Counselor Lord Tadamune, and being an orphan, the late Fujiwara Middle Counselor Ienari took him as a son-in-law while still Governor of Harima; when Tadamasa was treated splendidly, they jeered at the Gosechi, "Is the Harima rice scouring rush, or is it muku leaves, that polishes a person's appearance so?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.7"></s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.8">In ancient times such things happened but no trouble came of it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.3.9">People said they were anxious about how it would be in these latter days.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.1">Just as expected, when the Gosechi ended, the courtiers all spoke in unison: "To attend a public banquet wearing a sword, or to be given weapons and enter and leave the palace, are rooted in ancient regulations governed by imperial order to protect formal etiquette.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.2">However, Tadamori Ason, calling upon a hereditary retainer, stationed a soldier in plain clothes in the small garden of the Hall, and he sat in the festival seat wearing a sword at his waist.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.3">These two articles are outrageous acts unprecedented in history.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.4">The matters have already piled up.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.5">It is difficult to escape the charge of crime.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.6">Quickly erase his name from the rolls and strip him of office," they each appealed; the Retired Emperor was greatly surprised and summoned Tadamori to question him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.7">He defended himself, saying, "First, regarding the retainer waiting in the small garden, I knew absolutely nothing about it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.8">However, perhaps because there were signs that people were recently conspiring together, a long-time retainer heard of the matter and, intending to save me from shame, came secretly without Tadamori's knowledge; this was a sequence of events beyond my power.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.9">If there is still blame to be assigned, perhaps that person should be summoned and surrendered.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.10">Next, regarding the sword, I left it in the custody of a palace servant.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.11">Should you not summon this and judge the nature of the blame based on whether it is a real sword or not?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.12"></s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.13">Saying this was reasonable, they summoned the sword and upon Imperial inspection, the outside was a dagger sheath lacquered black, but inside was a wooden sword covered with silver foil.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.14">"Although he appeared to carry a sword to escape the shame of the moment, his preparation in carrying a wooden sword, knowing there would be accusations later, is admirable.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.15">The strategy of one who takes up bow and arrow should indeed be like this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.16">Furthermore, regarding the retainer waiting in the small garden, that is partly the custom of a warrior's retainer.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.17">It is not Tadamori's fault."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.2.4.18">Thus, rather than being punished, he received Imperial praise, and there was no judgment of crime.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.3.6.2">Next, in the twelfth month of the first year of Heiji, during Lord Nobuyori's rebellion, he defeated the rebels on the Imperial side; his merit was not singular, and saying the reward should be heavy, the following year he was promoted to Senior Third Rank, continuing to rise through Consultant, Commander of the Guards, Superintendent of the Police, Middle Counselor, and Major Counselor; furthermore, he reached the rank of Minister, and without passing through Left and Right, rose from Palace Minister to Grand Minister of State, Junior First Rank.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.3.6.3">Although not a General, he was granted armed guards and had retainers accompany him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.3.6.4">He received a decree allowing ox carts and hand-drawn carriages, and entered and left the palace riding in them.</s>

Thus, Lord Tokitada, the Major Counselor of the Taira and brother-in-law of the Lay Priest Chancellor, said, "Those who are not of this clan are not people." Because it was so, everyone, no matter who, schemed to form a connection with them.

<s xml:id="sent1.4.3.1">Also, regarding the administration of any wise king or sage emperor, or the judgments of a Regent or Chancellor, it is the common custom for idlers who are dissatisfied with the world to slander and criticize them where no one can hear, but while this Zenmon [Kiyomori] was at his height, no one spoke even slightly carelessly. The reason is that by the Lay Priest Chancellor's design, three hundred boys of fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen years old were gathered, their hair cut in a bob [kaburo], wearing red hitatare robes, and were employed to permeate the capital and go back and forth. If there was anyone speaking ill of the Heike, if one heard it, he would summon the rest, break into that house, seize the assets and furnishings, bind the person, and drag them to Rokuhara. Therefore, although people saw with their eyes and knew in their hearts, no one expressed it in words. Since they were called the Kaburo of Rokuhara, horses and carriages passing on the road swerved to let them pass. Even when entering or leaving the palace gates, their names were not asked; it seemed the officials of the capital looked away because of this.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.3">After the Emperor passed away, even the heartless grass and trees should have appeared sorrowful, but due to the wretchedness of this disturbance, high and low alike lost their wits and scattered in all directions.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.4">Around the hour of the Horse on the twenty-ninth, it was heard that the masses of the Mountain Gate were descending on the capital in great numbers, so warriors and police officials rushed to West Sakamoto to defend, but the monks disregarded them, broke through, and burst in.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.7">The Cloistered Emperor also hurriedly made a royal visit to Rokuhara.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.8">Lord Kiyomori was still a Major Counselor at that time, and he was greatly afraid and agitated.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.9">Lord Komatsu [Shigemori] calmed him, saying, "For what reason would such a thing happen right now?" but the clamor of high and low was intense.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.10"></s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.11">The masses of the Mountain Gate did not attack Rokuhara but pushed onto the unrelated Kiyomizu Temple and burned down every single temple building and monk's quarter.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.12">It was heard that this was to wipe away the shame of the defeat on the night of the funeral.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.13">This was because Kiyomizu Temple was a branch temple of Kōfukuji.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.9.1.14">On the morning Kiyomizu burned, someone, perhaps as a prank, wrote on a placard "The pit of fire of Kannon changed into a pool—how is that?" and stood it in front of the great gate; the next day, a return placard was posted: "Through kalpas of mysterious power, it is beyond reach."</s>

                  Then, on the sixteenth day of the seventh month of the first year of Kaō, the Cloistered Emperor became a monk.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.2">Even after becoming a monk, since he administered the myriad affairs of state, there was no difference in the retired emperor's administration.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.3">For the nobles, courtiers, and upper and lower North Face guards employed closely in the retired emperor's palace, the ranks and stipends were all more than they deserved.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.4">However, since it is the nature of the human heart, they were still not satisfied, and friends who were not strangers whispered together in gatherings: "Ah, if that person died, that province would open up; if that person were lost, I would get that post.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.5">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.6">The Cloistered Emperor also said privately, "Although there have been many who quelled enemies of the court since ancient times, there has never been a case like this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.7">When Sadamori and Hidesato struck Masakado, when Yoriyoshi destroyed Sadatō and Munetō, and when Yoshiie attacked Takehira and Iehira, the rewards given did not exceed provincial governorships.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.8">That Kiyomori behaves as he pleases is indeed improper.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.9">This too is because the world has reached its end and the King's Law is exhausted."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.10">Though he said this, since there was no occasion for it, there was no reprimand.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.11">Since the Heike also did not particularly resent the court, the root of the disturbance in the world began on the sixteenth day of the tenth month of the second year of Kaō; Lord Komatsu's second son, the New Captain of the Third Rank Lord Sukemori, who was then still Governor of Echizen and thirteen years old, was out when snow was falling lightly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.12">The withered fields were truly scenic, so taking about thirty young samurai, he rode out to Rendaino, Murasakino, and the Ukon riding grounds, set many hawks, flushed out quail and skylarks, hunted all day, and returned to Rokuhara at twilight.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.13">The Regent at that time was Lord Matsudono, and he was returning from the Nakamikado Higashinotōin palace.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.14">Intending to enter through the Ikuhōmon gate, he went south on Higashinotōin and west on Ōimikado.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.15">Sukemori Ason met the Regent's procession nose-to-nose at Ōimikado Inokuma.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.16">The attendants called out, "Who is it? This is outrageous.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.17">It is a procession; get down from your mounts, get down."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.18">But he was overly proud and spirited, treating the world as if it were not the world; moreover, the samurai he brought were all youths under twenty, and not one understood propriety or manners.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.19">Not caring that it was the Regent's procession, without any etiquette of dismounting, they tried to break through and pass; it was dark, and the attendants did not know at all that it was the Lay Priest's grandson.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.20">Or perhaps a few knew, but feigning ignorance, they pulled Sukemori Ason and the others off their horses, starting with Sukemori, and subjected them to considerable shame.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.21">Sukemori Ason crawled back to Rokuhara and complained of this to his grandfather, the Lay Priest Chancellor; the Lay Priest became very angry and said, "Even if it is the Regent, he should defer to Jōkai's family; that he gave shame without hesitation to a child is a matter of regret.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.22">From such things, one is despised by others.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.23">Unless I make him realize this, it will not do.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.24">I would take revenge on the Regent."

<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.25">But Lord Shigemori said, "This should not matter in the slightest.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.26">If we were despised by Genji like Yorimasa or Mitsumoto, it would truly be a shame for the clan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.27">That those calling themselves Shigemori's children met the Regent's procession and did not dismount is surely rude."

<s xml:id="sent1.11.1.28">He summoned the samurai involved in the incident and said, "From now on, understand this well; think that you would like to apologize to the Regent for your discourtesy."

<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.1">After that, the Lay Priest Chancellor did not consult Lord Komatsu but gathered rough country samurai who thought there was nothing more fearful than the Lay Priest's command, led by Nanba and Seno, sixty men in all, and said, "On the coming twenty-first day, the Regent is to go out to determine the Emperor's coming-of-age ceremony.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.5">Near Inokuma Horikawa, the Rokuhara soldiers, over three hundred horsemen in armor, lay in wait, surrounded the Regent, and raised a war cry all at once from front and rear.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.6">The vanguard attendants who had made today a gala occasion were chased here and cornered there, pulled from their horses, scattered and beaten, and one by one their topknots were cut off.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.7">Among the ten attendants, the topknot of the Right Officer of the Guards Takemoto was also cut.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.8">Among them, when cutting the topknot of the Chamberlain Takanori, they said, "Do not think of this as your topknot; think of it as your master's topknot."

<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.9">They included this message as they cut.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.10">After that, they poked bow tips into the carriage, tore down the blinds, cut the ox's crupper and breast-strap, scattered everything, raised a shout of triumph, and returned to Rokuhara.</s>

<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.14">Suppressing tears with his ceremonial sleeves, the misery of the return procession was beyond description.</s>
<s xml:id="sent1.11.2.15">Leaving aside Lord Tankai of the Taishokan, since Lord Chūjin and Lord Shōsen, we have never heard of a Regent or Chancellor meeting such an experience.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.1">The priest Saikō heard this and, wondering if it concerned himself, whipped his horse and galloped to the Retired Emperor's palace, Hōjūji-dono.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.2">The Taira samurai galloped to meet him on the road and said, "You are summoned to Nishi-Hachijō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.3">Come quickly."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.4">He said, "I have a matter to report, so I am going to Hōjūji-dono.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.5">I will go there immediately after."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.6">But they said, "Evil priest!</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.7">What is it that you would report?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.8">Do not let him speak."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.9">They pulled him down from his horse, bound him amidst them, and dragged him to Nishi-Hachijō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.10">Since he was a principal participant from the very beginning, they bound him especially tightly and dragged him into the courtyard.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.11">The Lay Priest Prime Minister stood on the great veranda and said, "That is the figure of the scoundrel who tries to overthrow the Lay Priest.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.12">Drag the fellow here."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.13">He had him dragged to the edge of the veranda, and while wearing his footwear, he trampled hard on Saikō's face.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.14">"Originally, you were a person of low rank who should not have been employed by the Sovereign, but you were given an office you should not have had, and while I watched you and your son behaving beyond your station, you managed to get the faultless Tendai Abbot exiled, brought about a great crisis in the realm, and furthermore, you are the scoundrel who participated in a rebellion to destroy this clan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.15">Speak the truth."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.16">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.17">Since Saikō was originally an exceptionally strong-willed person, he did not change color in the slightest, nor did he look intimidated.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.18">Sitting up straight, he laughed scornfully and said, "Just so, it is Lord Lay Priest who speaks beyond his station.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.19">I do not know about before others, but in Saikō's hearing, you cannot speak such things.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.20">Since I am a servant in the Retired Emperor's court, there is no way I could say I did not participate in a matter instigated by the Chief Administrator Lord Narichika as an Imperial Decree.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.21">I did participate.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.22">However, you say things that grate on the ears.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.23">Although you are the son of the late Minister of Punishments Tadamori, until you were fourteen or fifteen you did not serve at court, and when you entered the service of the late Middle Counselor of Nakamikado, Lord Ienari, the children of the capital called you Taka-Heida.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.24"> around the Hōen era, when you captured thirty pirate ringleaders by order of the Great General, even getting the fourth rank and being called Junior Assistant of the Gate Guards of the Fourth Rank was considered excessive by the people of the time.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.25">For the descendant of a person who was shunned even in the interaction of courtiers to rise to Prime Minister—is that not excessive?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.26">It is not without precedent or parallel for persons of the samurai class to become provincial governors or police commissioners.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.27">Why should it be excessive?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.28">Because he spoke without hesitation, the Lay Priest was too angry to speak.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.29">After a while, he said, "Do not cut off the fellow's head simply.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.30">Torture him well.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.31">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.32">Matsuura no Tarō Shigetoshi received the order and tortured him in various ways, crushing his hands and feet.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.33">Since he did not deny it from the start, the interrogation was strict.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.34">He confessed ruthlessly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.35">His confession was recorded on four or five sheets, and then, saying "Tear the fellow's mouth," they tore his mouth and beheaded him at Gojō Suzaku.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.36">His heir, the former Governor of Kaga, Morotaka, had been exiled to Idota in Owari, but he was killed by order to the resident of that province, the District Official of Ogoma, Koresue.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.37">The second son, Magistrate Moritsune, who was imprisoned, was dragged from prison and executed at the Rokujō riverbed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.38">His younger brother, Lieutenant of the Left Gate Guards Morihira, and three retainers also had their heads cut off.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.3.6.39">These men, excelling among the worthless, meddled in matters they should not have touched, managed to get the faultless Tendai Abbot exiled, and perhaps their luck ran out; incurring the immediate divine punishment of the Great Master of the Mountain King, they met with such a fate.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.1">The New Major Counselor was pushed into a single room, soaking with sweat, thinking, "Alas, what we have been doing lately must have leaked out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.2">Who could have leaked it?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.3">It must surely be one of the North Face warriors," and as he sat pondering continuously, footsteps sounded loudly from the rear; thinking, "Now warriors are coming to take my life," he waited. The Lay Priest himself stomped loudly on the floorboards and suddenly opened the sliding door behind where the Major Counselor was sitting.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.4">Wearing a short unlined silk garment with the hem of his white trousers tucked up, and wearing a sword with a hilt of raw wood pushed loosely through his sash, he looked exceedingly angry; he glared at the Major Counselor for a while and said, "Now, you should have been executed during the Heiji Disturbance, but the Minister of the Center [Shigemori] exchanged his own life to plead for you, and your head was reattached; how can this be?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.5">With what grudge have you planned to destroy this clan?</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.10">The Major Counselor said, "There is no such thing at all.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.11">It must be someone's slander.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.12">Please investigate carefully."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.13">Before he could finish speaking, the Lay Priest shouted,</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.14">"Is anyone there? Is anyone there?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.15">Sadayoshi entered.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.16">"Bring Saikō's confession."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.17">When ordered, he brought it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.18">Taking it, he read it repeatedly two or three times to him, saying, "Ah, how hateful! After this, what can you say?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.19">And throwing it suddenly in the Major Counselor's face, he slammed the sliding door shut and went out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.20">The Lay Priest, unable to contain his anger, called "Tsunetō, Kaneyasu," and Senoo no Tarō and Namba no Jirō entered.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.21">"Take that man and drag him down to the garden."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.22">When he said this, they did not move immediately, saying, "How will Lord Komatsu's mood be?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.23">The Lay Priest Prime Minister became very angry: "Enough, enough! You fellows respect the Minister of the Center's life and make light of the Lay Priest's orders, it seems.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.24">Then there is nothing to be done."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.25">Seeing that this might be bad, the two men stood up and dragged the Major Counselor down to the garden.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.26">At that time, the Lay Priest seemed pleased and said, "Throw him down and make him scream.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.27">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.28">The two men put their mouths to the Major Counselor's left and right ears and whispered, "Please let out your voice in any way," and when they pulled him down, he screamed two or three times.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.29"></s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.30">That appearance seemed no different from sinners in the underworld being weighed on the scales of karma or facing the crystal mirror, and being tortured by the demons of hell according to the weight of their sins.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.1.33">For example, Xiao He, Fan Kuai, Han Xin, and Peng Yue were all loyal subjects of Gaozu, but due to the slander of small men, they suffered the shame of destruction; should one speak of such things?</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.1">Minister Komatsu, after a long time had passed, arrived carrying his heir, the Provisional Assistant Master Major General Koremori, in the back of his carriage, accompanied by four or five guards and two or three attendants, without bringing a single soldier, looking particularly casual.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.2">Beginning with the Lay Priest, people all looked on unexpectedly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.3">When he got out of the carriage, Sadayoshi quickly came up and said, "Why have you not brought a single soldier for such a great matter?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.4">He replied, "A 'great matter' refers to a great matter of the realm; is there any reason to call such a private matter a great matter?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.5">The men carrying weapons looked ashamed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.6">Wondering where the Major Counselor had been placed, he opened sliding doors here and there and looked; there was a place where a sliding door had been tied shut with a cross-knot.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.7">Thinking it might be here, he opened it, and the Major Counselor was there.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.8">Choked with tears, he lay face down and did not meet his eyes.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.9">"How is it?" he said.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.10">At that moment, seeing him, the look of joy on his face seemed like that of sinners in hell seeing the Bodhisattva Jizō, and it was pitiful.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.11">"What is this matter? I have met with such an experience.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.12">Now that you have come, I rely on you that it will be alright.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.13">I was to be executed during the Heiji Disturbance, but through your favor my head was reattached, and I rose to become a Major Counselor of the Senior Second Rank, and my age is already over forty.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.14">Your favor is difficult to repay fully in life after life.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.15">This time as well, please save my worthless life.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.16">If only my life is spared, I will become a monk, seclude myself at Kōya or Kokawa, and perform services for the afterlife."

<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.17">Thus he pleaded. "Be that as it may, surely your life will not be lost.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.18">Even if it were so, since Shigemori is here, I would exchange my own life for yours."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.19">Saying this, he left.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.20">Sitting before his father the Lay Priest, he said, " regarding the execution of Lord Narichika, you must consider it very carefully.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.21">Since his ancestor, the Master of the Palace Repairs Aquisue, served Retired Emperor Shirakawa, he has risen to become a Major Counselor of the Senior Second Rank, unparalleled in his family, and is currently the favorite of the Sovereign.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.22">How can it be right to behead him immediately?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.23">To send him out of the capital should be sufficient.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.24">The Kitano Tenjin, due to the slander of Minister Tokihira, had his name washed away by the waves of the four seas; the Minister of Nishi-no-miya, due to the slander of Tada no Manju, entrusted his resentment to the clouds of Sanyō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.25">Although each was innocent, they were exiled.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.26">These are handed down as the errors of the holy era of Engi and the Emperor of Anna.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.27">It was like this even in ancient times.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.28">How much more so in the Latter Age.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.29">Since you have already arrested him, even if you do not kill him quickly, what pain is there?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.30">It is seen in the texts: 'Treat doubtful punishments lightly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.31">Treat doubtful merits heavily.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.32"></s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.33">Although it is a personal matter, Shigemori is married to that Major Counselor's younger sister.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.37">I speak for the sake of the world, for the sake of the Sovereign, and for the sake of our house.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.38">Some years ago, during the regency of the late Lay Priest Minor Counselor Shinzei, he carried out the death penalty which had not been performed for twenty-five generations of Sovereigns, from the time Emperor Saga executed the Captain of the Right Gate Guards Fujiwara no Nakanari until the Hōgen era; he dug up the corpse of the Evil Minister of the Left of Uji and inspected it; these seemed like excessive government.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.39">Therefore, the ancients also passed down: 'If the death penalty is carried out, rebels within the seas will not cease.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.40"></s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.41">Following these words, after two years, the world was disturbed again in the Heiji era; Shinzei, who had been buried, was dug up, his head was cut off, and it was paraded through the main streets.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.42">Thinking that what he carried out in Hōgen returned upon himself before long, it was terrifying.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.44">In every way, there should be fear.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.45">Since there is nothing lacking in your glory, you probably do not think of it, but I desire prosperity for your children and grandchildren.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.46">It is seen that the good and evil of ancestors inevitably extend to descendants.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.47">I hear that 'A house that accumulates good surely has leftover blessings; a gate that accumulates evil surely has leftover disasters.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.3.48">In any case, it is not right that his head be cut off tonight."

<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.3">Do not do something wrong and bear a grudge against me."

<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.4">When he said this, the soldiers all stuck out their tongues and trembled with fear.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.12">It is rumored that beginning with the Minor Captain, the young lords will be arrested.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.13">Please hide anywhere quickly."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.14">When they said this, she replied, "Now that I have come to this state, what is the use of being safe even if I remain behind?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.15">I only wish to vanish like the dew of the same night.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.16">Even so, the sadness of not knowing that this morning was the end!"

<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.19">Since she could not remain, she went up Omiya and stayed at Unrin-in in the Kitayama area.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.20">Leaving her at a monk's quarters in that vicinity, the escorts, finding it hard to throw away their own lives, took their leave and returned.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.21">Now, left with only young people, with no one to ask questions of, the heart of the wife was pitiful to surmise.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.22">Looking at the fading light, she thought that the Major Counselor's dew-like life was limited to this evening, and thinking of it, she felt she would perish.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.23">Although there were many ladies-in-waiting and samurai, no one cleaned up things, no one even pushed the gates shut.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.24">Although horses stood lined up in the stables, there was not a single person to feed them grass.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.4.4.25">When dawn came, horse carriages used to line up at the gate, guests lined up in seats, playing and dancing, not thinking of the world as the world; people close by did not even speak loudly, but stood in awe until yesterday; the state changed overnight, and the principle that the prosperous must decline appeared before their eyes.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.1">Since messengers from Nishi-Hachijō came incessantly, the Consultant said, "We must go facing it, and let it happen as it may," and went out; the Minor Captain rode in the back of the Consultant's carriage and they went out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.2">Since the Hōgen and Heiji disturbances, the people of the Taira family had only pleasure and glory, and no sorrow, but only this Consultant, because of a worthless son-in-law, suffered such grief.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.3">When they came near Nishi-Hachijō, stopped the carriage, and announced their arrival, the Lay Priest Prime Minister said, "The Tanba Minor Captain must not enter inside here."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.4">So they dropped him off at a samurai's house nearby, and only the Consultant entered inside the gate.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.5">Before long, soldiers surrounded and guarded the Minor Captain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.6">He was separated from the Consultant Lord he had relied upon.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.7">The Minor Captain's heart must have been wretched.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.8">The Consultant sat at the middle gate, but the Lay Priest did not meet him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.9">He sent a message through Minamoto Magistrate Suesada: "I regret repeatedly having become close to a worthless person, but it is of no use.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.10">The personage married to him has been ill recently, and if she adds this grief from this morning, her life will surely end.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.11">Why should it matter?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.12">Please place the Minor Captain in Norimori's custody for a while.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.13">Since Norimori is here, why would I let him do anything wrong?"

<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.14">Suesada went and reported this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.15">"Ah, the usual Consultant does not understand things."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.16">And he did not reply immediately.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.17">After a while, the Lay Priest said, "The New Major Counselor Narichika plotted to destroy this clan and disturb the realm.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.18">This Minor Captain is that Major Counselor's heir.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.19">Be he distant or close, you cannot plead for him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.20">If this rebellion had succeeded, ask him if you would be safe."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.21">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.22">Suesada returned and reported this to the Consultant Lord; he looked truly dissatisfied and spoke again: "Since the Hōgen and Heiji eras, in repeated battles, I have thought to take your place and die.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.23">Hereafter, too, I intend to defend against rough winds first; even if Norimori is old, since I have many young children, how could we not serve as a defense for one side?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.24">Yet, when I say I will take custody of Naritsune for a while, your lack of acceptance implies you think Norimori is a person of two minds.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.25">Being thought of with such suspicion, what is the use of living in this world?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.26">Now, just give me leave; I will become a monk, seclude myself in a remote mountain village, and solely perform services for the afterlife.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.27">It is a useless association with the sad world.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.28">Because we are in the world, we have desires; because desires are not fulfilled, we have resentment.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.29">Nothing is better than loathing the sad world and entering the True Way."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.30">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.31">Suesada went and said, "The Consultant Lord has already made up his mind.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.32">Please arrange things somehow."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.33">The Lay Priest was greatly surprised and said, "Whatever the case, becoming a monk is too extreme.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.34">If that is the case, say that I entrust the Minor Captain to you for a while.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.35">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.3.36">Suesada returned and reported this to the Consultant Lord, who said, "Ah, one should not have children.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.2">He replied, "The Lay Priest was very angry and would not meet Norimori in the end.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.3">Although he frequently said it was impossible, perhaps because I said I would become a monk, he said to keep you at my residence for a while, but I do not think it will be good in the end."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.4">The Minor Captain said, "Just so, Naritsune too will prolong his life for a while through your favor.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.5">In connection with that, what have you heard about the Major Counselor?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.6">"I have not even thought as far as that," he said.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.7">At that time, tears fell in drops from his eyes: "Truly, that my life should survive for a while through your favor is appropriate, but the reason I regret my life is that I wish to see my father once more.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.8">If the Major Counselor is executed, what is the use of Naritsune living a worthless life?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.9">Please arrange it so that we may meet our fate in one place."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.10">When he said this, the Consultant looked very pained and said, "Well now, I spoke this and that about you.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.11">I did not think as far as that, but regarding the Major Counselor, since the Minister of the Center spoke in various ways this morning, I hear that for a while he is safe."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.12">When he said this, the Minor Captain wept and joined his hands in joy.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.13">"Who but a child would put aside his own situation right now and rejoice to this extent?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.14">The true bond is indeed between parent and child.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.15">Should one have a child?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.16">And immediately he reconsidered his thoughts.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.5.4.17">So, riding in the same carriage as in the morning, they returned.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.3">His appearance looked generally terrifying.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.6">After a while, the Lay Priest said, "Sadayoshi, what do you think of this matter?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.7">In the Hōgen era, more than half the clan, beginning with Taira no Uma-no-suke, went to the side of the New Retired Emperor [Sutoku].</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.8">As for the First Prince, since he was the foster child of the late Minister of Punishments [Tadamori], it was difficult in many ways to abandon him, but following the last injunctions of the Late Retired Emperor [Toba], I led the vanguard on this side.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.9">This is the first service.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.10">Next, in the twelfth month of the first year of Heiji, when Nobuyori and Yoshitomo seized the Palace, barricaded themselves in the Imperial Compound, and turned the world to darkness, the Lay Priest threw away his life, drove out the rebels, and arrested Tsunemune and Korekata; I have repeatedly been on the verge of losing my life for the Sovereign.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.11">No matter what anyone says, how could he abandon this clan for seven generations?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.12">Yet, heeding the words of Narichika, a useless fellow, and Saikō, a lowly scoundrel, the Retired Emperor's plan to destroy this clan is a matter of regret.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.13">If there are slanderers hereafter, I suspect a decree to hunt down this house will be issued.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.14">Once we become enemies of the court, no matter how much we regret it, it will be of no use.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.1.15">Until the world is quieted, I intend to move the Retired Emperor to the Seinan Palace at Toba, or otherwise, compel a royal visit here; what do you think?</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.6.4.2">The Minister took a seat above his younger brother Lord Munemori.</s>

</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.4">When he said this, the Minister could not bear to hear it and wept profusely.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.9">Also, your appearance does not seem like reality.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.10">Although our country is called a borderland scattered like millet, since the descendants of Amaterasu Ōmikami became masters of the country and the descendants of Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto administered the government, is it not against propriety for a person who has reached the post of Prime Minister to wear armor?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.11">In particular, you are a monk.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.12">To cast off the priestly robes, the banner of liberation of the Buddhas of the three worlds, and suddenly put on armor and carry a bow and arrows—inwardly you invite the sin of breaking precepts and lack of shame, and outwardly you violate the laws of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.13">Although this is a fearful thing to say, I cannot leave my intent at the bottom of my heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.14">In previous lives, there are four debts of gratitude.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.15">The debt to Heaven and Earth, the debt to the King, the debt to parents, and the debt to sentient beings; these are they.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.16">Among them, the heaviest is the debt to the Court.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.17">Under the wide heavens, there is no place that is not the King's land.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.18">Thus, we hear that even the sage who washed his ears in the waters of the Ying River and picked ferns on Mount Shouyang knew the propriety that Imperial commands are hard to disobey.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.19">How much more so, you have attained the post of Prime Minister, unheard of among our ancestors.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.20">So-called Shigemori, with a body of no talent and stupidity, has reached the rank of Minister.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.21">In addition, more than half the provinces and counties have become the domain of our clan, and fields and gardens are all at the disposal of our house.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.22">Is this not an unprecedented Imperial favor?</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.23">Now, forgetting these immense favors and trying to overthrow the Retired Emperor violently will go against the divine will of Amaterasu Ōmikami and Hachiman Bodhisattva.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.24">Japan is the land of the gods.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.25"> The gods do not accept incivility.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.26">Therefore, the point you have set your mind upon is utterly unreasonable.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.27">Though this clan has pacified the enemies of the court for generations and quieted the rebellious waves of the four seas, which is unparalleled loyalty, to boast of that reward is arrogant.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.28">In the Seventeen-Article Constitution of Prince Shōtoku, it is seen: 'Men all have hearts; hearts each have clingings. They consider right what we consider wrong; we consider right what they consider wrong.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.31">It is like a ring without an end.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.6.5.34">However, since your fortune is not exhausted, the rebellion has already been exposed.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.1">The wife of the Major Counselor was living in hiding in the vicinity of Urin-in in the northern hills of the capital.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.2">Even in normal times, a place one is not used to living in is gloomy, and as she was hiding deeply, the passing days and months seemed hard to dawn and hard to darken.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.3">Although there were many waiting women and samurai, some feared the world, and some were concerned about public eyes, so not a single person visited.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.4">However, among them, a samurai named Genzaemon-no-jō Nobutoshi, whose compassion was especially deep, constantly visited.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.5">Once, the wife summoned Nobutoshi and said, "Indeed, I heard he was at Kojima in Bizen, but lately I hear he is at a place called Ariki-no-Bessho or something.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.12">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.13">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.14">The wife was exceedingly happy, and immediately wrote it and gave it to him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.15">The young people also each had letters.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.17">First, he explained his request to the warrior in charge, Namba Jirō Tsunetō, who was moved by the extent of his intent and immediately let him see the Major Counselor.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.19">"Is it a dream?" he said, hardly daring to listen, and correcting his posture, he summoned him, "Here, here."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.20">When Nobutoshi entered and looked at him, first the wretchedness of his dwelling was one thing, but seeing his ink-dyed sleeves, Nobutoshi felt his eyes go dark and his spirit fade.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.21">He explained in detail the commands he had received from the wife, and took out the letters and presented them.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.22">When the Major Counselor opened and looked at them, the handwriting was obscured by tears and he could not tell who it was, but it was written, "The young people miss you and grieve so much, I can no longer bear the endless thoughts of my own body."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.23">He grieved that his daily longing was as nothing compared to this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.24">Thus four or five days passed, and Nobutoshi said, "I will stay here and see how you are at your final moment," but the warrior in charge, Namba Jirō Tsunetō, insisted it was not permitted, so unable to do otherwise, the Major Counselor said, "Then, go up.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.30">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.31">He wrote a reply and gave it to him; Nobutoshi received it and said, "I will come again," and took his leave to go out, but the Major Counselor said, "I do not think I can wait for the time you come again.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.32">I miss you so much, just a moment more." And he called him back again and again.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.33">But since it could not be, Nobutoshi suppressed his tears and returned up to the capital.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.34">When he presented the letter to the wife, she opened it and looked; sensing that he had already become a monk, she found a lock of his hair in the back of the letter; she could not look at it a second time.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.10.3.35">Saying that a keepsake is now only a source of pain, she threw herself down and wept.</s>

<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.1">Since the Minor Captain of Tamba and the Lay Priest Yasuyori were originally men of faith in Kumano, they said they wanted to somehow invite the Three Gongen of Kumano to this island and pray for their return to the capital, but the Abbot was by nature a man of no faith and did not join in.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.2">The two of them, with the same mind, searched around the island for a place that might resemble Kumano; there was the beauty of woods and ponds, with the appearance of red brocade and embroidery in various grades, and the wonder of cloud-topped peaks, with colors of jasper and silk not limited to one.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.3">The scenery of the mountain, down to the stands of trees, was superior to elsewhere.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.4">Looking to the south, the sea was boundless, and the waves of cloud and billows of smoke were deep; looking back to the north, from a towering mountain peak, a waterfall of one hundred shaku plunged down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.5">The sound of the waterfall was especially terrible, and the wind in the pines was a divine dwelling; it closely resembled the Nachi Mountain where the Flying Waterfall Gongen resides.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.6">So, they immediately named that place the Nachi Mountain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.7">Naming this peak Hongū (Main Shrine), that one Shingū (New Shrine), and calling the minor shrines "The Standard Prince," "That Prince," and so on, with Lay Priest Yasuyori as the leader and the Minor Captain of Tamba accompanying him, they imitated the Kumano Pilgrimage every day and prayed for their return to the capital.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.8">"Namu Gongen Diamond Youth, we pray you to bestow your mercy, let us return to our old home, and let us see our wives and children once more."

<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.9">Thus they prayed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.10">As the days accumulated, having no pure robes to change into, they wrapped themselves in hemp clothes; when they scooped water from the marsh for purification, they thought of it as the clear stream of the Iwada River, and when they climbed to a high place, they envisioned it as the Gate of Awakening (Hosshinmon).</s>
<s xml:id="sent2.15.2.11">Every time they paid homage, the Lay Priest Yasuyori offered a prayer; having no paper for offerings, he broke off flowers and offered them, saying:</s></p> </div>
<div class="tei_blockquote">In the current year, the first year of Jishō, the sign being Hinoto-Tori, the months being the tenth month and second month, the number of days being over three hundred and fifty, choosing a lucky day and favorable time, with awe we speak: before the vast presence of the teachings of Japan's foremost great miracle, the Kumano Three Place Gongen, the Flying Waterfall Great Being (Mahasattva), the Great Patron of Faith, the Palace Guard Fujiwara no Naritsune, and the Novice Shōshō, exerting the sincerity of a pure single mind and extracting the will corresponding to the three actions, reverently speak. Indeed, the Bodhisattva of Witness (Shōjō) is the Lord of Teachings who saves from the sea of suffering, the King of Awakening of the perfection of the three bodies. Or, he is the Master of the Eastern Pure Lapis Lazuli Medicine King, the Tathāgata who completely removes all sicknesses. Or, he is the Master who teaches in the Southern Potalaka, the Great Being who enters the heavy gate of mystery. The Young Prince is the original master of the Saha World, the Great Being who bestows fearlessness. Manifesting the Buddha-face on the summit, he fulfills the desires of sentient beings. Therefore, from the One Man above down to the ten thousand people below, or for peace in the present world, or for a good place in the afterlife, in the morning they scoop pure water to rinse away the filth of defilement, and in the evening they face the deep mountains and chant the precious titles, and the response is never negligent. We liken the height of the towering peaks to the height of the divine virtue, and compare the depth of the steep valleys to the depth of the great vow; parting the clouds we climb, and braving the dew we descend. If we do not rely on the ground of benefit here, how can we move our steps on the precipitous path? If we do not look up to the virtue of the Gongen, why would you necessarily reside in this secluded boundary? Therefore, Great Gongen of Witness, Great Being of the Flying Waterfall, line up your eyes of blue-lotus compassion, prick up your deer-like ears, perceive our peerless sincerity, and accept our earnest intentions one by one. If so, then the Two Gongen of Musubi and Hayatama, following each capacity, to guide sentient beings with affinity and to save the flocks without affinity, abandoning the dwelling adorned with seven treasures, softening your light of eighty-four thousand kinds, have become the same as the dust of the Six Paths and Three Existences. Therefore, fixed karma can also be turned; worshipping to seek long life and obtain long life, we link our sleeves and offer cloth and gifts without a gap. Layering the robes of forbearance, offering the flowers of the way of awakening, shaking the floor of the sanctuary, clearing the water of faith, we fill the pond of bringing benefit to living beings. If the gods accept this, why should our desires not be fulfilled? Looking up, we pray: Twelve Place Gongen, align your wings of benefit, fly far into the sky of the sea of suffering, stop the grief of exile, and let us accomplish the long-cherished desire of returning to the capital. Re-worship.</div>

Now that the Imperial Messenger has come seeking it and read the edict, how happy the departed soul must have felt. Vengeful spirits are indeed terrifying things. Thus, the deposed Crown Prince Sawara was named Emperor Sudō, and Imperial Princess Inoue was restored to the rank of Empress. These were all strategies to appease vengeful spirits. That Retired Emperor Reizei went mad, and Cloistered Emperor Kazan slipped from the fixed position of the ten virtues and ten thousand chariots, was due to the spirit of the Minister of Popular Affairs Motokata. That Emperor Sanjō's eyes were blinded was due to the spirit of the chaplain Kansan.</s>

As for the healers, the two Archbishops Kakusō and Un, the Seal of the Law Shungyō, the two Provisional Bishops Gōzen and Jissen, each raising the verses of the Sangha, rubbed rosaries for the Three Treasures of their main temples and mountains and the principal images they had possessed for years, praying intensely. While it seemed truly impressive and holy, the Cloistered Emperor, who was scheduled to visit the New Kumano Shrine and was in purification, took his seat near the brocade curtain and recited the Thousand-Armed Sutra; perhaps because of this, things changed completely, and the violent struggling of the mediums also quieted for a while. The Cloistered Emperor said, "Whatever evil spirit it may be, while this old monk is here like this, how can you approach? In particular, the vengeful spirits appearing now are all persons whom I made into men through my Imperial favor. Even if you do not harbor a heart of gratitude, how can you cause obstruction? Withdraw immediately."

<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.9">He went to the place where the Abbot's daughter was living in hiding and said, "Being left out of this opportunity, he has not come up.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.10">I have decided to somehow cross to that island and seek his whereabouts.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.11">Please give me a letter."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.12">When he said this, she wrote one weeping and gave it to him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.13">Thinking that even if he asked for leave, his parents surely would not permit it, he did not inform his father or mother.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.14">Since the moorings of the Tang ships are untied in the fourth or fifth month, he perhaps thought leaving in summer clothes would be too late.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.15">Leaving the capital at the end of March, braving many wave-paths, he went down to the Satsuma Gulf.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.16">At the harbor crossing from Satsuma to that island, people were suspicious and stripped him of the things he wore, but he did not regret it in the slightest; thinking only not to let people see the young lady's letter, he hid it inside his topknot.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.17">So, boarding a merchant ship and crossing to the island to look, what he had faintly heard in the capital was as nothing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.18">There were no rice fields.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.19">There were no dry fields.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.20">There were no villages.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.21">There were no hamlets.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.22">Though there were people naturally, he did not understand their spoken words.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.23">Thinking that among such people there might be one who knew his master's fate, he said "I would speak," and they answered "What is it?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.24">When he asked, "Do you know the fate of a person called the Administrator Priest of Hosshōji, who was exiled from the capital here?</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.25">", if they knew of Hosshōji or Administrator, they might answer.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.26">They just shook their heads and said, "Don't know."</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.27">Among them, one person understood and said, "Ah, yes, there were three such people here, but two were recalled and went up to the capital.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.28">One was left behind, and although he wanders here and there in confusion, his whereabouts are unknown.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.29">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.30">Uncertain of the mountain direction, he pushed far in, climbing peaks and descending into valleys, but white clouds buried the traces, and the path of coming and going was not clear; the mountain storm broke his dreams, and he did not see his face.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.1.31">Finally failing to find him in the mountains, he came to the seaside to search; other than the gulls carving prints on the sand and the plovers gathering on the white shoal of the offing, there was no one to ask for traces.</s>

<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.1">One morning, from the direction of the rocky shore, a person emaciated like a dragonfly came staggering out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.2">Thinking he must have been a monk originally, his hair had grown up toward the sky, he was covered in all kinds of seaweed, and looked as if he were wearing thorns.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.3">His joints were visible and his skin hung loose; as for what he wore on his body, neither silk nor cloth could be distinguished.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.4">In one hand he held rough seaweed he had picked up, and in the other he held a fish he had received from a fisherman; he tried to walk, but made no progress, staggering as he came out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.5"> "I saw many beggars in the capital, but I have never seen such a person. It is said 'All Asuras reside by the great ocean,' and that the Three Evil Paths and Four Realms of Asuras are by deep mountains and great oceans; I wonder if I have come searching into the Realm of Hungry Ghosts." While he thought this, the figure gradually walked closer. "Perhaps such a person might know my master's fate." He said, "I would speak." The figure answered, "What is it?" When he asked, "Do you know the fate of a person called the Administrator Priest of Hosshōji, who was exiled from the capital here?", the boy had forgotten his face, but how could the Abbot forget? Before he could say "I am he," the things he held in his hands fell, and he collapsed onto the sand. Thus Ariō knew his master's fate. He immediately fainted; Ariō took him onto his knees and said, "Ariō has come. I braved many waves to search this far, but without avail; how can you show me such a miserable sight?" As he spoke weeping, after a while, the Abbot regained his senses a little, and being helped up, said, "Truly, the extent of your intent in searching this far is admirable. Day and night, I thought only of the capital, and the faces of my beloved ones appeared in dreams and stood in visions. But after my body became terribly weak, I could not distinguish dream from reality. So I feel that your coming is only a dream. If this is a dream, what shall I do after I wake?" Ariō said, "It is reality. It is miraculous that your life has lasted until now in this condition.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.6">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.7">The Abbot said, "Indeed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.8">You can only guess the despair in my heart after I was abandoned by the Minor Captain and the Lay Priest Magistrate last year.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.9">I tried to throw myself into that current, but relying foolishly on the useless consolation of the Minor Captain, who said 'Wait for one more message from the capital,' I tried to survive; but since this island is a place with absolutely no human food, while I had strength in my body, I went up the mountain to gather sulfur and exchanged it for things when meeting merchants from Kyushu; but as I grew weaker day by day, now I cannot do even that.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.10">When the day is calm like this, I go out to the rocky shore, rub my hands and bend my knees to the net-men and anglers to beg for fish; at low tide I pick up shellfish and gather rough seaweed; hanging my dew-like life on the moss of the shore, I have survived until today.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.11">Otherwise, you must wonder how I have managed to pass through this sorrowful world."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.12">The Abbot said, "Though I wish to say many things here, come to my house."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.13">Ariō thought, "How strange that he has a house even in this condition."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.14">As they went, inside a clump of pines, drifted bamboo was used for pillars, reeds were tied and crossed for beams, and pine needles were thickly piled on top and bottom, so that wind and rain could not accumulate.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.15">In the past, as the Administrator of Hosshōji, he controlled the affairs of over eighty manors, and within his roofed gates and flat gates, he was surrounded by four or five hundred servants and retainers.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.16">It was strange indeed to see him suffer such misery before one's eyes.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.17">Karma takes various forms.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.18">It is said there is karma for the present life, karma for the next life, and karma for subsequent lives.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.19">Everything the Abbot used for his body during his lifetime was nothing other than the temple goods and Buddha goods of the great cathedral.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.8.2.20">Thus, it seemed he was experiencing the retribution for the sin of using offerings without shame already in this life.</s>

</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.3">Ariō, choked with tears, looked down and did not speak for a while.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.4">After a time, he rose, suppressed his tears, and said, "When my Lord went out to West Hachijō, immediately police officials came, seized the people of the household, interrogated them about the rebellion, and they were all executed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.5">Your wife, unable to hide the young one, was hiding deep in Kurama; only this boy visited from time to time to serve, and although your wife's grief was not shallow, the young master missed you so excessively that every time I visited he would pester me, saying 'Ariō, take me to Kikai-ga-shima.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.6">But in the second month of last year, he passed away from smallpox.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.7">Your wife, sinking under the grief of that and the events concerning you, grew weaker day by day, and on the second day of the third month of the same year, finally passed away.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.8">Now only the young lady is living with her aunt in Nara.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.9">Here is a letter from her."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.10">And he took it out and presented it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.11">When he opened and looked, it was written just as Ariō had said.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.12">At the end, it was written: "Why is it that of three people exiled, two were recalled, but you have not come up until now?</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.13">Ah, whether high or low, there is nothing as wretched as the body of a woman.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.14">If I were a man, why would I not come to search for you, even to the island where you are?</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.15">Accompanied by this Ariō, please come up quickly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.16">"</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.17">"Look at this, Ariō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.18">The fragility of the way this child writes.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.19">It is resentful that she writes 'Accompanied by him, come up quickly.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.20">If Shunkan's body were free to follow his heart, why would I spend three years of springs and autumns here?</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.21">I think the boy would be twelve this year; if he had not passed away like this, he would be seen by people, serve at court, and support himself." He wept, showing that although a parent's heart is not darkness, it wanders on the path of thinking of the child. "After being exiled to this island, having no calendar, I do not know the changing days and months; only by seeing the flowers scatter and leaves fall do I distinguish spring and autumn; when the cicada voices herald the wheat harvest, I think it is summer; seeing the accumulation of snow, I know it is winter. Seeing the waxing and waning of the white moon and black moon, I distinguish the thirty days; counting on my fingers, I thought the young one would be twelve this year, but it seems he has already gone ahead.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.22">White moon and black moon refer to the phases of the moon.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.23">When I went out to West Hachijō, and this child yearned to go too, I persuaded him to stay saying I would return soon; I remember it now.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.24">If I had known that was the end, why did I not look at him for even a moment longer?</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.25">Becoming parent and child, forming the bond of husband and wife, all are promises limited to this one life.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.26">Why then, when they had gone ahead like that, did you not let me know even in a dream or illusion until now?</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.27">Regardless of shame before others, the reason I wished somehow to keep my life was to see them once more.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.28">Only the matter of the daughter is painful, but since she is alive, she will get by despite her grief.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.29">To survive only to show myself to you in such misery would be too shameless even for me."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.30">Saying this, he stopped his own eating, devoted himself to chanting the name of Amida, and prayed for right mindfulness at the end.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.31">On the twenty-third day after Ariō crossed over, he finally passed away inside that hut.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.32">It was heard his age was thirty-seven.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.33">Ariō clung to the empty body, looked up to heaven and threw himself on the ground, weeping and grieving, but it was to no avail.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.34">When he had wept to his heart's content, he said, "I should follow you immediately to the afterlife, but only the young lady remains in this world.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.35">There is no one to pray for her afterlife.</s>
<s xml:id="sent3.9.1.36">I will live for a while to pray for you." Without changing the sleeping mat, he broke down the hut, covered him with withered pine branches and dried reeds, and turned him into the smoke of salt-burning; when the cremation was finished, he gathered the white bones, hung them around his neck, and waiting for the convenience of a merchant ship, arrived in the land of Kyushu.</s>

Although he said this, awed by his father the Zen Initiate's mood, he could not go. "Ah, in this too, he is unexpectedly inferior to his brother the Minister of the Center.

Both the Southern Capital and Northern Capital are disciples of the Tathagata. Whether one's own temple or another temple, we must mutually subdue the demonic hindrances of Devadatta.

In the old days when Lord Treasurer Tamefusa was Governor of Kaga, he was appointed to the Kebiishi (Police Commissioner); in the old days when Master of Repairs Aquisue was Governor of Harima, he was appointed to the post of Stable Master. However, when his real father Tadamori was permitted access to the Hall, the old and young of the Capital and country all regretted the flaw in the Imperial Court, and the glory of inside and outside lamented the prophecy of Mt. Ma. Though Tadamori preened his wings for the blue clouds, the people of the world still despised the seed of a white (common) house. Young samurai who value their name did not aspire to that house. However, since the first year of Heiji, in the twelfth month, when the Retired Emperor, feeling the merit of a single battle, conferred unmatched rewards, he has since climbed high to the Prime Ministership, and additionally been granted military escort. His sons disgrace the court ranks, or are listed in the Palace Guards. His daughters fill the post of Empress, or receive the decree of Jusangū. His flock of brothers and bastard children all walk the thorny path, and his grandsons and nephews all divide the bamboo tallies (governorships). In addition, he controls the Nine Provinces, advances or retreats the hundred officials, and treats them all like slaves and servants. If one hair differs from his mind, he imprisons them even if they are royalty; if a single word goes against his ear, he binds them even if they are high nobles. Because of this, wishing to prolong their lives for a moment, or thinking to escape insult for a short time, the Sacred Lord of Ten Thousand Chariots makes a face of flattery, and the Lords of hereditary houses conversely perform the courtesy of walking on their knees. Though he steals the hereditary domains of generations, Imperial Judgment fears him and rolls up its tongue; though he takes the manors inherited by the Palaces, fearing his authority, they say nothing. Riding too much upon his victory, in the eleventh month of last year's winter, he seized the residence of the Retired Emperor and exiled the Lord Regent. The excess of his treason is truly unprecedented in ancient and modern times. At that time, we should have by all means marched against the rebel host and questioned their crimes, but hesitating due to divine will, or because they called it an Imperial Order, we suppressed our gloom and passed the time; meanwhile, he has again raised military troops and surrounded the palace of the Second Prince of the Cloistered Emperor; at this point, the Hachiman Shrine, Kasuga Great Deity, secretly manifesting themselves, have lifted up the Imperial Palanquin, sent him to your temple, and entrusted him to the doors of Shinra. It is clear that the Imperial Law should not be exhausted. Consequently, the fact that your temple risks its life to protect him—who among sentient beings would not rejoice? We, being in a distant region, were feeling this sentiment, when we faintly heard the rumor that the Lay Priest Kiyomori, still raising his mad temper, intends to enter your temple; thus we were making preparations. On the 18th, at one point in the hour of the Dragon (8 AM), we roused the great assembly, sent letters to various temples, issued orders to branch temples, and after obtaining soldiers, we intended to send a guide, when a blue bird flew in and dropped your fragrant letter. The gloom of many days has dissolved at once. Even the monks of that one mountain of Qingliang in the Tang house turned back the government troops of Wuzong. How much more so the monks of the two gates of North and South in Japan—why should we not sweep away the wicked kind of scheming subjects? Solidify well the left and right camps of the Liang Garden; you should wait for the announcement of our advance. Observe the situation, and do not harbor doubts. Thus we send this letter.</div>

<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.2">Immediately taking the tonsure, he was called the Lay Priest of the Third Rank Minamoto; this year he became seventy-five.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.3">What is thought to be the greatest fame of this person's life is that during the reign of Emperor Konoe, around the Ninpei era, the Emperor was frequently frightened and terrified at night.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.4">They ordered high and noble monks with spiritual power to perform great and secret rituals, but they had no effect.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.5">The affliction occurred around the hour of the Ox; a clump of black clouds would come from the direction of the forest of Tō-Sanjō and cover the palace, and he would invariably be frightened.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.6">Because of this, the nobles held a deliberation.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.7">Long ago in the Kanji era, during the reign of Emperor Horikawa, similarly, the Emperor was frightened night after night.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.8">The General at that time, Yoshiie Ason, was serving on the main veranda of the Southern Hall; when the time of the affliction arrived, he plucked his bowstring three times and announced his name in a loud voice, "Former Governor of Mutsu, Minamoto no Yoshiie," and everyone's hair stood on end, and the affliction ceased.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.9">Therefore, following precedent, saying that a warrior should be ordered to guard, they chose from among the soldiers of the two houses of Genji and Heike, and it was rumored that this Yorimasa was selected.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.10">At this time he was still called Hyōgo-no-Kami.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.11">Yorimasa said, "From ancient times, the placement of warriors at the Imperial Court has been to drive away rebels and destroy those who disobey imperial commands.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.12">I have never heard of an order to deal with invisible shapeshifting things."</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.13">Though he said this, since it was an Imperial Order, he responded to the summons and attended the palace.</s>

<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.15">He himself wore a double hunting robe, took two pointed arrows made with pheasant tails along with a lacquered rattan bow, and served on the main veranda of the Southern Hall.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.16">The reason Yorimasa held two arrows was because Masayori-kyō, who was then still a Minor Controller of the Left, had selected him saying, "The person to deal with the shapeshifter is Yorimasa"; so, if he missed the shapeshifter with the first arrow, he intended to shoot the neck bone of Controller Masayori with the second arrow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.17">Not differing from what people had said for days, when the time of the affliction arrived, a clump of black clouds came from the direction of the forest of Tō-Sanjō and trailed over the palace.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.18">When Yorimasa looked up sharply, there was the shape of a strange thing in the clouds.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.19">He thought that if he missed this, he should not live in this world.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.20">Nevertheless, he took an arrow, nocked it, prayed in his heart "Namu Hachiman Daibosatsu," drew fully, and shot with a twang.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.21">He felt the hit, and it struck with a thud.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.22">He gave the archer's shout, "Got it!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.23">I no Hayata rushed up, found the place where it fell, pressed it down, and pierced it nine times in succession.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.24">At that time, high and low lit fires in their hands and looked at it; the head was a monkey, the body a tanuki, the tail a snake, and the limbs were the shape of a tiger. </s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.25">Its crying voice resembled a nue bird.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.26">To say it was terrifying implies too little.</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.27">The Emperor was exceedingly impressed and bestowed upon him a sword called "Lion King."</s>
<s xml:id="sent4.15.3.28"> The Minister of the Left of Uji received this and passed it down; as he descended about halfway down the steps of the hall to give it to Yorimasa, since it was around the tenth of the fourth month, a cuckoo called two or three times in the clouds as it passed.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.1">Also, seeking a precedent in a foreign land, a man called Prince Dan of Yan was imprisoned by the First Emperor of Qin and suffered confinement for twelve years; Prince Dan shed tears and said, "I have an old mother in my home country; please grant me leave to see her."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.2">When he said this, the First Emperor laughed scornfully and said, "I shall wait until horns grow on a horse and a crow's head becomes white to grant you leave."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.4">Yan Dan looked up to heaven and bowed down to earth, praying, "Please make horns grow on a horse and make a crow's head white.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.5">I wish to return to my hometown and see my mother once more."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.7">That Bodhisattva Myōon went to the Pure Land of Vulture Peak and admonished unfilial people; Confucius and Yan Hui appeared in China and initiated the way of loyalty and filial piety.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.8">Since the Three Treasures of the unseen and visible worlds pity the will of filial piety, horns grew on a horse and it came into the palace, and a crow's head became white and it perched on a tree in front of the garden.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.9">The First Emperor, surprised by the miracle of the white-headed crow and horned horse, and believing that Imperial Words must not be reversed, pardoned Prince Dan and sent him back to his home country.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.10">The First Emperor regretted it afterwards; there is a country called Chu on the border of the Qin country and Yan country.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.11">A great river flows there.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.12">The bridge crossing that river is called the Bridge of Chu.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.13">The First Emperor sent government troops and arranged it so that when Yan Dan crossed, if he stepped on the bridge in the middle of the river, he would fall; when Yan Dan crossed, how could he not fall in?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.14">He fell into the middle of the river.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.15">However, he did not drown in the water at all, but walked as if on flat ground and arrived at the opposite bank.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.1.16">Thinking "How can this be?", when he looked back, turtles, number unknown, had floated up on the water and lined up their shells for him to walk on.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.2">When the First Emperor sent government troops and intended to strike Yan Dan, Yan Dan was terrified and enlisted a soldier called Jing Ke (Keika) and made him a minister. </s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.3">Jing Ke in turn enlisted a soldier called Master Tian Guang (Denkō).</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.4">That Master said, "Do you rely on me thinking this body is young and vigorous?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.5">Though a Qilin flies a thousand li, when it is old it is inferior to a sluggish horse.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.7">I will enlist a soldier for you."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.8">As he was about to return, Jing Ke said, "Regarding this matter, be absolutely sure not to reveal it to others."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.10">The Master said, "There is no greater shame than being suspected by others.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.11">If this matter leaks, I will be suspected."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.12">So saying, he smashed his head against a plum tree in front of the gate and died.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.13">Also there was a soldier called Fan Yuqi (Hanoki).</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.14">He was a man of the Qin country.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.15">Having had his father, uncles, and brothers destroyed by the First Emperor, he fled and hid in the country of Yan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.16">The Qin Emperor issued an Imperial Order to the Four Seas proclaiming: "To the person who cuts off Fan Yuqi's head and presents it, I will give five hundred kin of gold."</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.22">When he said this, Fan Yuqi jumped up, sighed greatly, and said, "My parents, uncles, and brothers were destroyed by the First Emperor; thinking of this night and day, it pierces my marrow and is hard to bear.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.2.23">Truly, if I can destroy the First Emperor, giving my head is easier than dust."</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.2">When they reported that they had brought the map of Yan and the head of Fan Yuqi, he intended to receive it via a subject.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.3">Since they reported, "We will absolutely not give it through a person, we will present it directly," he said "Then so be it," arranged the ceremony of a festival gathering, and summoned the envoys of Yan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.6">The Xianyang Palace measured eighteen thousand three hundred and eighty li around the capital.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.7">They built up the palace three li high from the ground and it stood upon that.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.8">There was the Hall of Long Life and the Gate of Eternal Youth; they made a sun of gold and a moon of silver.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.9">Pearl sand, lapis lazuli sand, and gold sand were spread.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.10">On the four sides they built iron walls forty jo high, and over the palace as well they stretched an iron net.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.11">This was to prevent messengers from the netherworld from entering.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.12">Since there was an obstruction to free flight for the geese of the fields in autumn and those returning to the northern lands in spring, they named a gate in the wall the Wild Goose Gate, and opened the iron gate to let them pass.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.13">Among them was the Epang Palace, a hall where the First Emperor usually went to conduct affairs of state.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.14">The height was thirty-six jo, nine chō east-west, five chō north-south; under the main floor, five-jo flagpoles were erected but still did not reach.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.15">The top was roofed with lapis lazuli tiles, and the bottom was polished with gold and silver.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.16">Jing Ke held the map of Yan, and Qin Wuyang held Fan Yuqi's head, and they ascended the jeweled steps.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.17">Seeing the magnificence of the Palace, Qin Wuyang trembled uncontrollably, so the subjects were suspicious and said, "Wuyang has a rebellious heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.18">One does not place a criminal by the lord's side; a gentleman does not approach a criminal; approaching a criminal is the way to treat death lightly."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.19">Jing Ke turned back and said, "Wuyang has absolutely no rebellious heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.20">It is only that he is accustomed to rural baseness, and because he is not used to the Imperial Palace, his mind is confused."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.21">So the subjects all calmed down first.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.22">Thus they approached the King.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.23">When he put the map of Yan and Fan Yuqi's head in for inspection, at the bottom of the box containing the map, a sword like ice was visible; the First Emperor saw this and immediately tried to flee.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.24">Jing Ke grabbed the King's sleeve firmly and pressed the sword to his breast.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.25">It seemed that this was the end.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.26">Although tens of thousands of soldiers lined their sleeves in the courtyard, they had no power to save him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.27">They only grieved together that the Lord was being violated by a rebellious subject.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.28">The First Emperor spoke: "Grant me a moment of leave.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.29">I wish to hear the sound of the koto of my most beloved consort one more time."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.30">Because he said this, Jing Ke did not attack him for a moment.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.31">The First Emperor possessed three thousand consorts.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.32">Among them sat a superior koto player called Lady Huayang.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.33">Generally, upon hearing the sound of this consort's koto, the anger of fierce warriors softened, flying birds fell, and grass and trees swayed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.34">How much more so, as she played weeping, intending it for the Imperial hearing for the last time, it must have been beautiful.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.35">Jing Ke also lowered his head and pricked up his ears, and his thoughts as a scheming subject relaxed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.36">At that time the consort began to play another song.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.37">"Though the seven-foot screen is high, if you jump, how could you not cross it?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.38">Though a single strand of silk is strong, if you pull, how could it not break?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.39">Thus she played.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.40">Jing Ke did not understand this, but the First Emperor understood, tore off his sleeve, jumped over the seven-foot screen, and fled and hid behind a copper pillar.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.41">Jing Ke was angry and threw the sword at him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.42">Just then, a physician on duty in the Imperial presence threw his medicine bag at Jing Ke's sword.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.43">Though the sword was impeded by the medicine bag, it cut halfway through the copper pillar with a diameter of six shaku.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.44">Since Jing Ke did not have another sword, he did not throw a second time.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.45">The King returned, summoned his sword, and cut Jing Ke into eight pieces.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.46">Qin Wuyang was also killed.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.6.4.48">Since the Azure Heaven did not pardon him, the white rainbow pierced the sun but did not pass through, Qin Shi Huang escaped, and Yan Dan was finally destroyed.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.7.1.2">Though he had spent many years there, if one asks with what intent he raised a rebellion this year, it is said that the High Priest Mongaku of Takao encouraged him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.1.3">That Mongaku was originally the son of Watanabe no Endō Sakon-no-Shōgen Mochitō; called Endō Musha Moritō, he was a retainer of Jōsai-mon'in.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.1.4">At the age of nineteen, developing a desire for the Way, he took the tonsure; intending to go out for ascetic practice, he said, "How great a matter is ascetic practice? I shall test and see."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.1.5">Under the blazing sun of the sixth month, when not even the grass stirred, he crawled into a thicket on a remote mountain, lay face up, and though horseflies, mosquitoes, bees, ants, and other poisonous insects attached themselves tightly to his body and stung and bit him, he did not move his body in the slightest, and did not rise until seven days had passed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.1.6">On the eighth day, he rose up and asked people, "Is ascetic practice as great a matter as this?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.1.7">When they said, "If it were to that extent, how could one's life survive?", he said, "Then it is easy," and immediately went out for ascetic practice.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.2">Since it was past the tenth day of the twelfth month, the snow had fallen and piled up, forming icicles; the sound of the valley stream had ceased, the wind on the peaks blew freezing, the white threads of the waterfall had become hanging ice, and everything was lined in white cloth, so that the treetops in all directions could not be distinguished.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.3">Nevertheless, Mongaku immersed himself in the waterfall basin, soaking up to his neck, and began fulfilling the spell of Fudō (Jikyū-no-shu); after two or three days, or rather four or five days, unable to bear it, Mongaku floated up.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.4">Since it was a waterfall cascading down thousands of jō, how could he stay put?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.5">He was dashed down with a crash, and amidst the sharp rock edges like sword blades, floating and sinking, he was washed downstream for five or six chō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.6">At that time, a beautiful youth came and took Mongaku's left and right hands and pulled him up.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.7">People thought it a miracle, and when they built a fire and warmed him, since his life was not yet destined to end, his breath returned before long.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.8">Mongaku regained his senses a little, opened his large eyes wide in anger, and said, "I have a great vow to stand under this waterfall for three times seven days and fulfill three hundred thousand recitations of the Fudō spell.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.9">Today is barely the fifth day.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.10">When even seven days have not passed, who is it that has pulled me out here?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.11">When he said this, those who saw it had their hair stand on end and could say nothing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.2.12">Again he returned to the waterfall basin, stood, and was struck by the water.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.3">Perhaps not wishing to defile the waterfall basin, two heavenly youths with their hair bound up descended from the top of the waterfall, and from the top of Mongaku's head to the tips of his fingers and toes, rubbed him down with extremely warm and fragrant hands; as he felt this, he felt like he was dreaming and breathed out. "Now, what kind of persons are you that you pity me so?" he asked.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.5">"We are the two attendants of the Great Holy Fudō Myōō, Kongara and Seitaka.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.6">Because Mongaku has made a supreme vow and attempted brave austerities, by the command of the Myōō saying 'Go and lend him strength,' we have come."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.7">Thus they answered.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.8">Mongaku made his voice angry and asked, "Well then, where is the Myōō?"</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.14">Truly, because there were auspicious signs, the blowing wind did not penetrate his body, and the falling water was like hot water.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.7.3.15">Thus, having finally fulfilled the great vow of three times seven days, he secluded himself at Nachi for a thousand days, went to Ōmine three times, Katsuragi twice, Kōya, Kokawa, Kinpusen, Hakusan, Tateyama, the peaks of Fuji, Izu, Hakone, Togakushi in Shinano, Haguro in Dewa; generally traveling around all places in Japan without exception; yet still perhaps longing for his hometown, he returned to the Capital; he was rumored to be a miracle worker with powers sharp enough to pray down flying birds.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.1"> Later, he settled in the depths of a mountain called Takao and devoted himself to practice.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.2">At that Takao, there is a mountain temple called Jingo-ji.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.3">It is a temple built long ago in the time of Empress Shōtoku by Wake no Kiyomaro.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.4">Since there had been no repairs for a long time, in spring it was shrouded in haze, in autumn mixed with mist; the doors fell to the wind and rotted under fallen leaves; the roof tiles were invaded by rain and dew, and the Buddhist altar was completely exposed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.5">Since there was no resident priest, the only thing that rarely entered was the light of the moon and sun.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.6">Mongaku raised a great vow to repair this somehow, and holding a subscription list (Kanjinchō), he went around urging donors in all directions; at one time, he went to the Hōjūji Palace of the Retired Emperor.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.7">Although he reported that he sought a contribution, it was the occasion of a musical gathering, and he was not listened to.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.8">Mongaku was by nature a fearless and supreme rough saint.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.9">Not knowing the internal situation of the Imperial presence, thinking only "I have reported it," he forced his way into the courtyard without right or wrong, raised a great voice and said, "Since you are a Lord of Great Mercy and Compassion, why should you not listen?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.8.1.10">And spreading out the subscription list, he read it loudly.</s>

<div class="tei_blockquote">The Novice Mongaku respectfully speaks. Specifically, receiving the assistance of high and low, priest and layman, I request to build a temple on the sacred ground of Mt. Takao, and perform the great profit of peace in the two worlds. A letter of solicitation. Considering this: Absolute Reality is vast. Although it cuts off the temporary names of sentient beings and Buddhas, the clouds of following delusion in the Dharma-nature cover thickly; since living in line on the peaks of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, the moonlight of the innate lotus of the heart is dim, and has not yet appeared in the great void of the Three Virtues and Four Mandalas. How sad. The Buddha-sun set early, and the crossroads of the cycle of birth and death are dark. Only indulging in lust, indulging in wine. Who will apologize for the delusion of the mad elephant and leaping monkey? In vain slandering people, slandering the Dharma. How can one escape the blame of King Yama and his jailers? Here, although Mongaku has just brushed off worldly dust and decorated himself with priestly robes, evil deeds are still vigorous in his heart, created day and night; good seedlings go against his ear and are abandoned morning and evening. How painful. To return again to the fire pits of the Three Paths, and revolve forever in the wheels of suffering of the Four Births. For this reason, the non-dual scriptures are in thousands and ten thousands of scrolls; scroll by scroll they clarify the cause of the Buddha-seed; of the Dharmas of following conditions and perfect sincerity, there is not one that does not reach the other shore of Enlightenment. Therefore, Mongaku sheds tears at the gate of contemplation on impermanence, encourages the true and secular of high and low, moves steps toward the High Rank Lotus Pedestal, and intends to build a sacred place for the King of Equal and Wondrous Enlightenment. Now, Takao: the mountain is high, representing the treetops of Vulture Peak; the valley is quiet, spreading the moss of the Shangshan cave. The rock spring chokes and draws a cloth; the mountain monkeys scream and play on the branches. Human villages are far and there is no noise or dust; close by there is only faith. The terrain is superior; truly one should revere the Buddha-heaven. Though the contribution be small, who would not assist? I hear in the wind: gathering sand to make a Buddha stupa instantly attains the Buddha-cause. How much more so regarding treasure and wealth of a single paper or half a coin? I pray that the construction be accomplished, and the Imperial Vow of the Golden Gate and Phoenix Calendar be fulfilled; and further, from the Capital to the countryside, far and near, neighbors and people, intimates and strangers, may sing of the non-action rule of Yao and Shun, and open the smile of a reunion like the Camellia leaf. Especially, may the spirits of the dead, obscure rituals, former and latter, great and small, quickly reach the terrace of the One Buddha True Gate, and inevitably enjoy the moon of the Three Bodies and Ten Thousand Virtues.

<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.1">At that time in the Imperial presence, the Prime Minister Myōon-in strummed the biwa and recited poetry magnificently.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.2">Azechi Dainagon Sukekata-kyō kept the beat and sang Fuzoku and Saibara songs.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.3">Sama-no-Kami Suketoki and Fourth Rank Chamberlain Morisada strummed the wagon (Japanese zither), singing imayō in various ways; inside the jeweled blinds and brocade curtains they made merry, and since it was truly delightful, the Cloistered Emperor also deigned to join in the singing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.4">Into this, Mongaku's great voice intruded, and the tone differed, and the rhythm was completely disordered.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.5">"Who is it?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.6">Strike him on the neck!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.7">Such was the command given.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.8">Among the impetuous young men advancing saying "Me too, me too," a man called Hangan Sukeyuki ran out and said, "What kind of thing are you saying?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.9">Get out!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.10">Mongaku said, "Unless a manor is donated to Jingo-ji in Takao, Mongaku will absolutely not leave."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.11">And he did not move.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.12">When Sukeyuki approached and tried to strike him on the neck, Mongaku re-gripped the subscription list, struck Sukeyuki Hangan's eboshi hat with a "thwack" knocking it off, clenched his fist, struck him on the chest, and knocked him over backwards.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.13">Hangan Sukeyuki, with his topknot loose, fled up onto the main veranda screaming.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.14">After that, Mongaku pulled out from his bosom a sword wrapped in horse hair, looking like ice, and waited for anyone who would come at him to strike.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.15">Since he ran around with the subscription list in his left hand and the drawn sword in his right hand, as it was an unexpected and sudden event, it looked as if he held swords in both left and right hands.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.16">The nobles and courtiers made a commotion saying "What is this, what is this?", and the musical gathering was quickly ruined.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.17">The disturbance in the palace was extraordinary.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.18">A resident of Shinano Province, Andō Musha Sukemune, who was then serving in the Mushadokoro (Warriors' Office), said "What is the matter?", drew his sword, and ran out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.20">Thinking it would be bad to cut him in such a place like the Imperial Garden, he reversed his sword to hold the back, and struck Mongaku's arm holding the sword hard.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.21">While Mongaku flinched slightly from the blow, Sukemune threw away his sword, shouted "Got you!", and grappled with him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.23">While being grappled, Mongaku poked Andō Musha's right elbow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.24">While being poked, Sukemune squeezed him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.25">Since both were of unmatched great strength, they rolled up and down; then, looking wise, high and low gathered around and bound Mongaku securely where he moved.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.26">However, he made nothing of this and shouted abuse all the more.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.27">They dragged him outside the gate and gave him to the servants of the Kebiishi.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.28">They took him and bound him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.29">While being bound and standing there, he glared in the direction of the Palace, raised a great voice and said, "You may not make a contribution.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.30">Since you have shown Mongaku such a painful time, I will make you realize it later.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.31">The Three Worlds are all a burning house.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.32">Even if it is a Royal Palace, it cannot escape that difficulty.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.33">Even if you boast of the Imperial Throne of the Ten Good Deeds, after you go on the journey to the Yellow Springs, you will not escape the torture of the Ox-headed and Horse-headed demons."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.34">Thus he spoke, jumping up and down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.35">Saying this priest is outrageous, he was immediately put in prison.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.36">Hangan Sukeyuki, in the shame of having his eboshi knocked off, did not appear for duty for a while.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.37">Andō Musha, as a reward for grappling Mongaku, was made Uma-no-Jō without going through the ranks of seniority.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.38">Meanwhile, at that time Bifukumon-in passed away, and since there was a general amnesty, Mongaku was pardoned before long.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.39">He should have practiced anywhere for a while, but not doing so, he again held up the subscription list and solicited; when refused, he went around saying only fearful things like, "Alas, this world will soon be in chaos, and both Lord and subjects will be destroyed."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.40">"We cannot keep this priest in the Capital; exile him."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.1.41">So saying, he was exiled to Izu Province.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.1">Since the heir of the Lay Priest of the Third Rank Minamoto, Nakatsuna, was then the Governor of Izu, he handled the matter; saying he should be sent down by boat via the Tōkaidō, two or three low-ranking officials (hōmen) were assigned to take him to Ise Province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.2">These men said, "It is the custom of the servants of the Office that in such matters we have our own reliance (tips).</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.3">Well, Holy Priest, meeting such a fate and being exiled to a distant province, do you not have acquaintances? Please ask for things like souvenirs and food provisions."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.4">When they said this, Mongaku said, "I do not have friends to whom I should speak of such necessary matters, but I do have a friend in the vicinity of Higashiyama.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.5">Well then, I will send a letter."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.6">They found some crude paper and gave it to him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.7">"There is no way to write on such paper."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.8">And he threw it back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.9">Saying "Then...", they found thick paper and gave it to him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.10">Mongaku laughed and said, "The priest cannot write; so you guys write."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.11">"Write this: 'Mongaku, with the intent of building and dedicating Jingo-ji in Takao, was soliciting, but meeting with such a reign, I have not accomplished my vow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.12">I was imprisoned and furthermore exiled to Izu Province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.13">It is a long road.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.14">Things like souvenirs and food provisions are important.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.15">Give them to this messenger.'"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.16">When he told them to write this, they wrote exactly as he said, and asked, "Now, to whom shall we address it?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.17">"Write: To Kannon-bō of Kiyomizu."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.18">"This is deceiving the servants of the Office," they said.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.19">"Nevertheless, Mongaku relies deeply on Kannon.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.20">Otherwise, to whom should I speak of my business?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.2.21">Thus he spoke.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.1">They boarded a boat from the port of Anotsu in Ise Province and went down, but at Tenryū-nada in Tōtōmi Province, a great wind suddenly blew and great waves rose, about to capsize the boat.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.2">The sailors and helmsmen tried to save it somehow, but since the wind and waves became increasingly rough, some chanted the name of Kannon, and others reached the final ten invocations.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.3">However, Mongaku made nothing of this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.4">He was lying down snoring loudly, but whatever he thought, when it seemed it was the end, he jumped up suddenly, stood at the bow of the ship, glared at the open sea, raised a great voice and shouted, "Is the Dragon King there? Is the Dragon King there?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.6">"Why do you try to wreck a ship carrying a saint who has made such a great vow?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.7">You Dragon Gods will receive the punishment of Heaven right now!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.8">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.9">Perhaps because of that, the wind and waves quieted before long, and they arrived in Izu Province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.10">Mongaku had made a vow from the day he left the Capital.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.11">"If I am to return to the Capital and perform the construction and dedication of Jingo-ji in Takao, I shall not die.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.12">If this vow is to be in vain, I shall die on the road."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.13">So, from the Capital until arriving in Izu, since there was often no favorable wind and they went along the coast and islands, for a period of thirty-one days, he completely fasted.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.14">Nevertheless, his energy did not diminish in the slightest, and he sat performing austerities.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.15">Truly, there were many things that did not seem like an ordinary person.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.9.3.16">He was entrusted to a man called Kondō Shirō Kunitaka and lived in the depths of Nagoya in Izu Province.</s>

<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.1"> Meanwhile, he constantly visited Hyōe-no-Suke (Yoritomo), and while they amused themselves telling stories of past and present, at one time Mongaku said, "In the Heike, Lord Komatsu was the only one strong in heart and superior in strategy.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.2">Perhaps the fate of the Heike is coming to an end; he passed away last year in the eighth month.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.3">Now among the Genji and Heike, there is no one who possesses the physiognomy of a Shogun to your extent.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.4">Quickly raise a rebellion and take possession of the country of Japan."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.5">Hyōe-no-Suke said, "What unexpected things you say, Holy Priest.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.6">Since I had my worthless life saved by the late Nun of the Ike, I do nothing but read the Lotus Sutra every day to pray for her afterlife."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.7">Mongaku spoke again: "If one does not take what Heaven gives, one conversely receives the blame.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.8">There is a text that says if one does not act when the time comes, one conversely receives the disaster.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.9">Since I speak like this, do you think I am speaking to test your heart?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.10">Look at the color of my deep sincerity toward you."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.11">And from his bosom, he took out a skull wrapped in white cloth.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.12">Hyōe-no-Suke asked, "What is that?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.13">"This is the head of your father, the late Captain of the Left Stables.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.14">After Heiji, it was buried under the moss in front of the prison, and there was no one to pray for his afterlife, but Mongaku, having a thought, begged the prison guard for it, hung it around my neck for these ten-plus years, went around worshipping at mountains and temples, and prayed for him, so by now he has surely been saved for a kalpa.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.15">Therefore, Mongaku is a servant even for the sake of the late Captain."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.16">When he said this, Hyōe-no-Suke, though he did not know if it was certain, hearing it was his father's head, first shed tears in nostalgia.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.17">After that, he opened up and spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.18">"However, unless the Imperial Censure against Yoritomo is pardoned, how can I raise a rebellion?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.19">"That is an easy matter; I will go up immediately and get a pardon."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.20">"Even so, for you, a priest who is also under Imperial Censure, to say you will get someone pardoned, your estimation is very unreliable."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.21">"If I said I would get my own Censure pardoned, that would be wrong.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.22">Why should it be difficult to speak of your matter?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.23">To go up to the present capital, the New Capital of Fukuhara, will not take more than three days.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.24">To ask for the Imperial Decree will take a stay of one day.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.25">In total, it should not exceed seven or eight days."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.26">Saying this, he rushed out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.27">Returning to Nagoya, he told his disciples that he had an intent to seclude himself for seven days in the mountains of Izu hidden from people, and left.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.28">Truly, in three days he went up to the New Capital of Fukuhara, and since he had a slight connection with Former Sahyōe-no-Kami Mitsuyoshi-kyō, he went there and said: "The exile of Izu Province, Former Sahyōe-no-Suke Yoritomo, says that if he is pardoned from Imperial Censure and receives an Imperial Decree, he will mobilize the housemen of the eight provinces, destroy the Heike, and pacify the realm."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.29">Hyōe-no-Kami said, "Well now, I myself have been suspended from three offices at present, and it is a painful time.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.30">The Cloistered Emperor is also confined, so how will it be?</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.31">Nevertheless, I will try to ask."</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.32">When he secretly reported this, the Cloistered Emperor immediately issued an Imperial Decree.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.33">The saint hung this around his neck, and again in three days arrived down in Izu Province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.34">Hyōe-no-Suke was sitting worrying without pause, thinking "Alas, this Holy Priest has rashly proposed a useless thing, and what kind of trouble will Yoritomo meet with again?" when around the hour of the Horse on the eighth day, he arrived and presented it, saying "Here is the Imperial Decree!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent5.10.1.37">Hyōe-no-Suke, grateful to hear it was an Imperial Decree, washed his hands and rinsed his mouth, put on a new eboshi and hunting robe, bowed three times to the Imperial Decree, and opened it.</s>

Therefore, since the founding of the Court, for several thousand years, there has been no one who tried to overturn the Imperial Plan and endanger the state who was not defeated. If so, then partly relying on the invisible aid of the Way of the Gods, and partly observing the intent of the Imperial Order, quickly punish the Taira clan and drive away the enemies of the Imperial House.

Considering this: formerly, with a mediocre and obscure body, I unworthily trod the rank of Emperor. Now, I play with wise policies in the group of spiritual realms, and enjoy leisure in the dwelling of Mt. Ye. However, secretly extracting the sincerity of one heart, I visit the secluded shrine of the solitary island, look up to invisible grace under the auspicious fence, concentrate my earnest thoughts and shed sweat, and receive a divine oracle within the treasure palace. There is a notification inscribed in my heart. Especially, pointing to the period of fear and caution, it corresponds entirely to the season of late summer and early autumn. Illness suddenly invades, and medical arts still show no effect. The duckweed and cassia (status) turn frequently. I know more and more that divine response is not empty. Though I seek prayer, the mist and dew are hard to scatter. Therefore, extracting the will of my heart, I intend to undertake the practice of travel again. At the bottom of the vast cold storm, lying in a travel lodge, dreams are broken; before the dreary faint sun, facing a long road, I strain my eyes. Finally arriving at the site of the shrine, I reverently spread a pure seat, and offer a copy of the Lotus Sutra in colored paper and ink characters, the opening and closing sutras, Amida and Heart Sutras, one scroll each. One scroll of the Devadatta Chapter written in gold dust with my own hand. At this time, in the shade of green pines and green oaks, together adding seeds of good principle, the tide goes and comes, echoing in the sky, harmonizing with the voice of chanting. Though the disciple (I) bid farewell to the clouds of the Northern Palace and seasons have not cycled much, I have braved the waves of the Western Sea twice, and deeply know that the opportunity and connection are not shallow. The guests who pray in the morning are not one. Those who offer thanks in the evening are nearly a thousand. However, though the reverence of the noble is great, a visit by a Retired Emperor has not yet been heard of. The Cloistered Emperor Zenjō began this ceremony. The disciple (I), with insignificant body, deeply transports his will; before the moon of Mt. Songgao, Emperor Wu of Han did not yet worship the shadow of softened light. At the bottom of the clouds of the Penglai cave, heavenly immortals vainly separated the dust of manifestation. I reverently pray, Great Deity, I humbly beg, may the One Vehicle Sutra newly illuminate my sincere prayer, and grant a unique response.</div>

The Great General was Tō-no-Chūjō Shigehira, and the Vice-General was Chūgū-no-Suke Michimori; with a total force of over 40,000 horsemen, they set out for the Southern Capital. The monks, disregarding old and young, numbering over 7,000 men, tightened their helmet cords, dug ditches across the two roads of Narazaka and Hannyaji, built walls and shields, pulled up abatis, and waited. The Heike divided their 40,000 horsemen into two groups and pressed upon the two fortifications of Narazaka and Hannyaji, raising a great war cry. The monks were all on foot wielding melee weapons. The government troops galloped their horses around and around, chasing them here and there, nocking and pulling their bows rapidly and shooting scatteringly, so the defending monks exhausted their numbers and were killed. They began exchanging arrows at the hour of the Hare (6 AM) and fought all day until dark. Entering the night, both fortifications at Narazaka and Hannyaji were breached. Among the fleeing monks, there was a warrior monk named Saka no Shirō Eikaku. In wielding weapons, taking up bow and arrow, and in physical strength, he surpassed the Seven Great Temples and the Fifteen Great Temples. Over a green-laced belly guard, he wore armor laced with black thread. Tightening the cords of a five-plate helmet over a hat, holding a large white-handled naginata curved like a reed leaf and a black-lacquered great sword in his left and right hands, with over ten fellow monks standing before and behind him, he fought his way out from the Tegai Gate.</s>

<s xml:id="sent6.4.7.18">Saying this, she could not hold back her tears, and Nakakuni also dampened his sleeves.</s>
<s xml:id="sent6.4.7.19">After a while, Nakakuni suppressed his tears and said, "That you decide to go to the depths of Ohara starting tomorrow must mean you intend to change your appearance (become a nun).</s>

<s xml:id="sent7.5.1.9">At that time, I, Yoshinaka, will pretend to negotiate/hesitate for a while, wait for the sun to set, and intend to drive the great Heike army down into the Kurikara Valley."</s>
<s xml:id="sent7.5.1.10">So saying, he first sent thirty white banners ahead and planted them on top of Kurosaka. Just as he thought, the Heike saw this and said, "Ah, the Genji vanguard faces us; they must be a large force. If we go out into the open without thought, the enemy knows the terrain and we do not. If we are surrounded, it will be bad. This mountain is rocky on all four sides. They surely won't circle to the rear.

<s xml:id="sent7.5.1.15">Kiso took up position at Hanyū and looked around quickly in all four directions; through the green trees on the peak of the summer mountain, a vermilion jewel fence was faintly visible, and there was a shrine built in katasogi style.</s>

<div class="tei_blockquote">Taking refuge and bowing my head, Hachiman Daibosatsu is the main lord of the Imperial Court of the Sun Domain (Japan), the ancestor of wise rulers of successive generations. To protect the Precious Throne and benefit the people, he manifested the golden form of the Three Bodies, and pushed open the provisional doors of the Three Places. Here, in recent years, there is a person called Taira no Shōkoku (Prime Minister), who controls the Four Seas and causes suffering to the ten thousand people. He is already an enemy of the Buddha's Law, a foe of the King's Law. I, Yoshinaka, unworthily born in a house of bow and horse, barely continue the dust of my ancestors' work. Considering his violence, I cannot look back in contemplation. Entrusting my fate to the Way of Heaven, I throw my body to the state. Tentatively raising a righteous army, I wish to drive away the weapon of evil. However, though the fighting houses have joined battle, the soldiers have not yet obtained the courage of unity; while I feared in my divided heart, now at this one camp, on the battlefield where I raise my flag, suddenly I worship the shrine altar of the Three Places' softened light. The maturity of the opportunity and response is clear. The punishment of the villains is not in doubt. Tears of joy spill, and longing dyes my liver. Especially since my great-grandfather, Former Governor of Mutsu Yoshiie Ason, entrusted his body to the clan of the Ancestral Shrine and took the name Hachiman Tarō, there has been no one among his descendants who did not revere it. Yoshinaka, as his descendant, has inclined his head for many years. Now raising this great merit is like measuring the great ocean with a baby's shell, or a mantis raising its axe against a high carriage. However, I raise this for the sake of the country and the Lord; I do not raise this for the sake of my house or myself. The arrival of my will has divine response in heaven. How reliable. How joyful. I humbly pray, may the unseen and visible add their authority, combine the power of spiritual gods to decide the victory at once, and drive the enemies to the four directions. If my sincere prayer matches the unseen thought, and the mysterious mirror grants protection, please first show one auspicious sign.</div>

<div class="tei_blockquote">Yoshinaka, carefully observing the treason of the Heike: since Hōgen and Heiji, they have long lost the propriety of subjects. Although high and low bind their hands and priests and laity lift their feet (in reverence/fear), they selfishly manipulate the Imperial Throne and plunder provinces and districts to satisfaction. Without discussing right or wrong, they pursue powerful families; without speaking of guilt or innocence, they destroy nobles and attendants. Taking their property, they give it all to their retainers; confiscating their manors, they brazenly leave them to their descendants. Especially, in the eleventh month of the third year of Jishō, they moved the Cloistered Emperor to the detached palace of Jonan, and exiled the Regent to the remote region of the Western Sea. The multitude does not speak, but the roads cast eyes (of disapproval). In addition, in the fifth month of the fourth year of the same, they surrounded the red pavilion of the Second Prince, startling the dust of the Nine-Fold Palace. Here, when the Imperial Son, to escape undue harm, secretly entered Onjō-ji, Yoshinaka, having previously received an Imperial Command, was about to raise the whip, but enemies filled the streets, blocking the road to participation. The Genji of nearby borders still did not attend, how much less those of distant borders. However, since Onjō-ji had limited means, he headed for the Southern Capital, and fought at Uji Bridge. Although the Great General, Lay Priest of the Third Rank Yorimasa and his son, treating life lightly and righteousness heavily, strove for the merit of a single battle, they could not escape the attack of the great force, exposing their corpses to the moss of the old bank and letting their lives flow in the waves of the long river. Engraving the purport of the Command in my liver, I erase the sorrowful souls of my kin. Therefore, the Genji of the eastern and northern provinces each plan to go up to the Capital and wish to destroy the Heike. Last autumn, on the day I raised my flag, took my sword, and left Shinshu to achieve my long-held desire, the resident of Echigo Province, Jō no Shirō Nagashige, led tens of thousands of soldiers and set out; we fought at Yokotagawara in that province. Yoshinaka, with only three thousand and more horsemen, defeated those tens of thousands of soldiers. As the rumor spread widely, the Taira General led one hundred thousand soldiers and set out for the northern land. At the fortresses of Esshū, Kashū, Tonami, Kurosaka, Shiozaka, Shinohara and others, we fought several times. Moving strategy within the command tent, we obtained victory within a short distance. Thus, when we attack, they inevitably bow; when we assault, they inevitably surrender. It is no different from the autumn wind breaking the banana plant. It is the same as the winter frost withering the flock of leaves. This is entirely the help of the Gods and Buddhas, not at all Yoshinaka's military strategy. Since the Taira clan has been defeated, I plan to go up to the Capital. Now I must pass the foot of Mt. Hiei and enter the streets of Luoyang (Kyoto). At this time, I secretly have doubts. Are the monks of Tendai in agreement with the Heike, or cooperating with the Genji? If you help those rebels, I must fight against the monks. If I fight, the destruction of Mt. Hiei will follow on my heels. How sad, that while the Taira clan troubles the Imperial Heart and destroys the Buddha's Law, and I raise a righteous army to quiet the treason, I should suddenly engage in an unforeseen battle against the three thousand monks. How painful, that deferring to the Healing King and the Mountain King, if I delay my journey, I will be slandered as a negligent subject of the Court and leave a lasting flaw on my military strategy. Bewildered in advancing or retreating, I open my guide. I hope that the three thousand monks, for the sake of the Gods, for the sake of the Buddha, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the Lord, will agree with the Genji, punish the villains, and bathe in great transformation. I cannot bear the depth of my sincerity. Yoshinaka, with fear and trembling, respectfully speaks.</div>

<div class="tei_blockquote">The letter of the 10th of the sixth month arrived on the 16th of the same; upon opening and reading it, the gloom of many days dissolved at once. Generally, the treason of the Heike has extended for many years, and the disturbance of the Court has no time of cessation. The matter is in the mouths of people, and cannot be lost. Now, regarding Mt. Hiei, as the benevolent shrine of the northeast of the Imperial Capital, we perform pure prayers for the peace of the state. However, the whole heaven has long been invaded by that premature rebellion, and the four seas are not calm and have not obtained safety. It is as if the Dharma wheels of Exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism do not exist, and the divine authority of protection is frequently obsolete. Here, your noble house, fittingly born in a family of military preparation for generations, is fortunately the benevolence of pure selection at this time. Planning strange stratagems beforehand, you suddenly raise a righteous army. Forgetting life amidst ten thousand deaths, you establish the merit of a single battle. Your toil has not yet exceeded two years, but your name already flows through the four seas. The monks of our mountain tentatively receive this with joy. For the sake of the state, for the sake of your family, we are impressed by your military merit and military strategy. If this is so, then we rejoice that the pure prayers on the mountain were not in vain, and know that the protection within the seas has not been negligent. Our temple, other temples, the permanent Buddha Dharma, the main shrine, branch shrines, the gods of festivals, will surely rejoice that the teaching will flourish again, and rejoice that reverence will return to the old ways. In the hearts of the monks, we ask only for your wise consideration. If so, in the unseen world, the Twelve Divine Generals, as messengers of the Healing King Sugata, will join the brave warriors in pursuing the villains, and in the visible world, the three thousand monks will temporarily stop the diligent practice of study and admiration to help the government army punish the evil companions. The Brahma wind of the Ten Vehicles of Cessation and Contemplation will sweep the treacherous companions outside the Japanese court, and the Dharma rain of the Three Mysteries of Yoga will return the customs of the time to the ancient days of Yao. The council of the multitude is like this. Carefully observe this.</div>

<s xml:id="sent7.12.1.4">The letter said:</s></p> </div>
<div class="tei_blockquote">Respectful Statement. Regarding treating Enryaku-ji as the clan temple and Hiyoshi Shrine as the clan shrine, and solely revering the Tendai Buddha Dharma. Right: The members of this clan have a special prayer. If asked the purport: Mt. Hiei, since the reign of Emperor Kanmu, after Dengyō Daishi returned from Tang, spread the Perfect and Sudden Teaching in this place, and transmitted the Shana Great Precepts within it; since then, it has been exclusively the spiritual cave of the flourishing Buddha Dharma, preparing the training ground for protecting the state. Just now, the exile of Izu Province, Minamoto no Yoritomo, does not regret his own guilt, but conversely mocks the court laws. In addition, participating in treacherous plots, the Genji who agree, Yoshinaka, Yukiie and others, forming parties, are numerous. They plunder neighboring and distant provinces, and seize local products and tribute items. Therefore, either pursuing the traces of ancestral merit, or relying on the present arts of bow and horse, we unworthily receive the Imperial Command to quickly pursue the rebels and subjugate the evil parties, and plan a punitive expedition. Here, the formations of fish-scales and crane-wings do not bring advantage to the government army; the authority of star banners and lightning halberds seems to let the rebel kind ride on victory. If not for the protection of Gods and Buddhas, how can we quell the chaotic disturbance of rebellion? Therefore, we solely take refuge in the Tendai Buddha Dharma, and together rely on the divine grace of Hiyoshi. How much more so, unworthily, if we think of the ancestors of us subjects, we should be called the remaining descendants of the main vow. We should revere it more and more, we should respect it more and more. From now on, if there is joy in the Mountain Gate, we shall make it the joy of the whole clan; if there is anger in the Shrine family, we shall make it the anger of the whole house; transmitting this to each descendant, we shall never let it fall for eternity. The Fujiwara clan takes Kasuga Shrine and Kōfuku-ji as clan shrine and clan temple, and has long taken refuge in the Hossō Mahayana sect. The Taira clan takes Hiyoshi Shrine and Enryaku-ji as clan shrine and clan temple, and will encounter the Perfect, Real, Sudden Enlightenment teaching before our eyes. That is the relic of the past; for the sake of the house, they think of glory. This is the vow of the present; for the sake of the Lord, we ask for punishment. We look up and pray: Mountain King Seven Shrines, Prince Attendants, Dharma-Protecting Sacred Multitudes of East and West, Twelve Superior Vows Healing King Sugata, Sunlight and Moonlight Twelve Divine Generals, illuminate our non-dual sincerity, and grant a unique response. Meanwhile, may the thieves of evil plots and rebellious hearts bind their hands at the military gate, and the fellows of violent cruelty pass their heads to the capital earth. Therefore, the high nobles of this house, with different mouths but the same voice, make obeisance and vow as above.</div>

<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.1">The Heike had now settled the capital in Tsukushi and there was talk that a palace should be built, but when it was heard that Koreyoshi had rebelled, there was an uproar of "What is this?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.2">Hei Dainagon Tokitada-kyō said, "That Koreyoshi is a retainer of the Komatsu-dono.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.3">One of the Komatsu-dono's sons should face him, persuade him, and see."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.4">Since this was said to be true, the Komatsu New Sanmi Chujo Sukemori-kyō crossed over to Bungo Province with more than five hundred horsemen and tried to persuade him in various ways, but Koreyoshi did not obey.</s>

</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.7">Saying this, he chased him back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.8">Using Koreyoshi's second son, Nojiri Jiro Koremura, as a messenger, he said to Dazaifu, "Since the Heike are lords of heavy obligation, I should take off my helmet, unstring my bow, and join you, but it is the Cloistered Emperor's decision that you be quickly driven out of the nine provinces.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.9">You should probably leave quickly."

<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.10">When he sent this message, Hei Dainagon Tokitada-kyō, in scarlet-tied hakama, a hitatare of kudzu thread, and a tall eboshi, went out to face Koremura and proclaimed, "Now our Lord is the direct line of the forty-ninth generation from the Heavenly Grandson, the eighty-first generation Human Sovereign.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.13">The villains of the eastern and northern provinces have been cajoled by Yoritomo and Yoshinaka, and thinking it true that if they accomplish the deed they will be entrusted with provinces and given manors, for you to follow Bungo's order based on that nose is not right."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.14">Thus he proclaimed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.15">Since the Bungo Governor Gyobu-kyō Sanmi Yorisuke-kyō had an exceedingly large nose, he proclaimed thus.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.1.16">Koremura returned and told this to his father, who said, "What is this? The past is the past, the present is the present; if that is the case, quickly drive them out of the nine provinces."

<s xml:id="sent8.4.2.3">Beginning with the Empress Dowager, the noble ladies held up the hems of their hakama, and the nobles and courtiers from the Minister Lord down tucked up their sashinuki; going out the gate of Mizuki, walking barefoot, striving to be first, to be ahead, they fled to the port of Hakozaki.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.4.2.8">Since they were not accustomed to walking, the blood coming from their feet dyed the sand; red hakama increased in color, and white hakama became red-hemmed.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.4.2.10">However, that was for the sake of seeking the Law, so there must have been benefit for self and others.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.4.2.11">This was because of hateful enemies, so thinking of the suffering of the next world as well is sad.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.8.1.3">Since he was a renowned warrior of great strength, Lord Kiso thought, "Should I lose such a valuable man?" and did not behead him; and since he was a person of elegant spirit and sentiment, Kuramitsu also treated him with courtesy.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.8.1.6">With curtains of leather and felt, they warded off the wind and rain; with mutton and mare's milk, they satisfied their hunger and thirst.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.1.7">Following orders to cut trees and mow grass all day long without time for sleep at night, Kaneyasu thought only of how he might spy an opening to kill the enemy and see his old master once more; the extent of his heart was indeed terrifying.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.8.2.10">Seno's heir, Kotaro Muneyasu, was serving with the Heike, but hearing that his father had been granted leave by Lord Kiso and was going down, he mustered his long-time retainers and went up to meet him with a force of about fifty horsemen; they met at the provincial capital of Harima and went down together.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.2.11">When they stayed at the station of Mitsuishi in Bizen Province, people close to Seno came out bringing sake.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.2.12">While they held a joyful banquet throughout the night, the warrior guards, Kuramitsu Saburo, and their attendants, more than thirty people in all, were dead drunk and could not rise; they stabbed every one of them to death.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.2.13">Bizen Province was the province of Jurō Kurōdo.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.8.2.16">When he broadcast this, the warriors of the three provinces of Bizen, Bitchu, and Bingo sent their horses, weapons, and suitable attendants to the Heike side, and the remaining old men, some tying the cords of persimmon-dyed hitatare, some tucking up the hems of cotton kosode, wearing kusari-haramaki [chain belly-bands], inserting a few arrows in mountain-quivers or high-quivers, gathered in haste to Seno, carrying what they could.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.2.17">In total, the force was more than two thousand men; with Seno Taro in the lead, they built a fortification at the narrow pass of Sasano in the Nawate of Fukuryuji in Bitchu Province, digging a moat two jo wide and two jo deep, pulling up abatis, raising high towers, setting up shields, and arranging their arrow-points, they waited, saying 'Now, come!'.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.2">When they reported this, Lord Kiso regretted it, saying, "It is not a peaceful matter.</s>

<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.11">Since there were deep paddies on the left and right and the horses' feet could not reach firm ground, though the hearts of the three thousand horsemen advanced, their horses could only walk in single file.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.12">When Kanehira pushed near and looked, Seno Taro stood forth on a tower and raised a great voice, "The kindness of each of you in sparing my worthless life from last fifth month until now, this is how I have prepared to repay it!"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.13">He had gathered several hundred superior strong-bowmen, arranged their arrow-points, and they shot rapidly and scatteringly without ceasing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.14">There was no way to face them.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.15">Beginning with Imai Shiro, the eager warriors such as Tate, Nei, Miyazaki Saburo, Suwa, and Fujisawa, tilting the neck-plates of their helmets, cleared away the men and horses that were shot and killed, filled in the moat, shouted war cries, and attacked.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.16">Some rode into the deep paddies on the left and right, not caring that their horses' flanks and chests were buried or that the water stood up to their bellies, and attacked in swarms; others did not shy away from valleys or cliffs, and they attacked and attacked, fighting all day until sunset.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.17">When night fell, the mustered warriors that Seno had gathered were all attacked and driven off; those who were saved were few, and those who were killed were many.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.18">Seno Taro, having his fortification at the Sasano Pass destroyed, retreated and set up shields at the edge of the Itakura River in Bitchu Province to wait.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.19">When Imai Shiro immediately pushed on and attacked, they defended as long as they had arrows in their mountain-quivers and bamboo-quivers, but when they had shot them all, they fled, trying to be first.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.20">Seno Taro was reduced to just three horsemen, master and retainers; reaching the edge of the Itakura River, they were fleeing toward Mitoroyama when Kuramitsu Jiro Narizumi, who had captured Seno in the northern provinces and whose younger brother had been killed, appeared.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.21">"It is not a peaceful matter.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.22">As for Seno, I will take him alive again."

<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.23">Breaking from the group, he chased after him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.24">Catching up to within about one cho, he called, "Ho, Seno-dono! Is it proper for a warrior to show his back to the enemy?</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.25">Turn back, turn back!"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.26">Being told this, he crossed the Itakura River to the west, pulled up in the middle of the river, and waited.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.27">Kuramitsu galloped up, lined up his horse, grappled firmly, and they fell with a crash.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.28">Since they were of equal great strength, they were on top, on bottom, rolling over each other; rolling into a deep pool at the river bank, Kuramitsu was not a swimmer, but Seno was an excellent swimmer, so he took Kuramitsu at the bottom of the water, pressed him down, pulled up the skirts of his armor, and stabbed him three times with his sword so that the hilt and fist went through, and took his head.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.29">Since his own horse was injured, he mounted the enemy Kuramitsu's horse and fled; meanwhile, Seno's heir Kotaro Muneyasu did not ride a horse but fled on foot accompanied by a retainer; although he was a man of twenty-two or twenty-three, he was excessively fat and could not run even one cho.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.30">He took off his armor and discarded it and walked, but he could not manage.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.31">His father abandoned him and fled about ten-odd cho.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.32">He met a retainer and said, "When Kaneyasu fights facing a thousand or ten thousand enemies day after day, all four directions seem clear and bright, but this time, because I have abandoned Kotaro and gone on, the way ahead seems completely dark and I cannot see.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.33">Even if Kaneyasu survives and joins the Heike side again, it would be shameful for fellow warriors to say, 'Kaneyasu, a man over sixty, sparing his short life, abandoned his only child and fled.'"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.34">The retainer said, "Indeed that is so; this is what I meant when I said please just stay in one place and meet your fate.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.35">Please turn back."

<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.36">So saying "Then," he turned back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.37">Kotaro was lying down with his feet swollen this much.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.38">When he said, "Since you cannot catch up, I have returned to die together in one place," Kotaro shed tears profusely and said, "Since this body is a worthless thing, I should have committed suicide, but that I should cause even your life to be lost is perhaps one of the Five Cardinal Sins.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.39">Please just escape quickly, quickly."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.40">Though he said this, the father said, "Since I have made up my mind," and as they were resting, Imai Shiro rode in the vanguard and chased them with a force of about fifty horsemen, shouting war cries.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.41">Seno Taro had seven or eight arrows remaining, and he shot rapidly and scatteringly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.42">Not caring for life or death, he instantly shot down five or six enemy horsemen.</s>
<s xml:id="sent8.8.3.43">After that, he drew his sword, first cut off Kotaro's head, then broke into the midst of the enemy, fought wildly, killed many enemies, and finally died in battle.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.2">That night, around the Hour of the Dog [8 p.m.], the Noble Scion Kurō summoned Doi Jirō and said, "The Heike are three ri distant from here; since they are holding the western mountain entrance of Mount Mikusa with a large force, should we approach for a night attack tonight, or a battle tomorrow?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.3">Tashiro Kaja came forward and said, "If we delay until a battle tomorrow, the Heike force will gain confidence.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.4">The Heike are over three thousand horsemen; our force is over ten thousand horsemen; we have a distant advantage.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.5">I believe we should choose a night attack."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.6">When he said this, Doi Jirō said, "How well Lord Tashiro speaks.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.7">In that case, let us attack immediately."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.8">Thus they set out.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.10">Doi Jirō said, "There is such a thing," and set fire to the lay houses of Ono-hara.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.8.1.11">Beginning with this, having set fire to the fields, mountains, grass, and trees, it was not in the least inferior to daytime, and they crossed over the mountain of three ri.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.8.3.5">Around midnight, ten thousand Genji horsemen pushed near and raised the war cry with a roar.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.2">Thus he taught me."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.3">The Noble Scion said, "What a graceful thing to say.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.4">Though snow buries the fields and plains, there is a saying that an old horse knows the way."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.5">Thus, placing a mirror saddle on a white-dappled old horse, fitting a white bit, tying the reins and throwing them over, they drove it ahead, and entered into the unknown deep mountains.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.6">Since it was early in the Second Month, the snow on the peaks had melted in patches, and there were places that looked like blossoms.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.7">The warblers of the valley sang, and there were places lost in mist.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.8">Looking up, the white snow was dazzling and towering; looking down, the blue mountains were jagged and the cliffs were high.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.9">The snow on the pines had not yet fully melted, and the narrow mossy path was faint.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.10">At times when the storm blew, one might mistake it for plum blossoms; as they went, whipping their horses east and west and hastening their steeds, the sun set on the mountain path, so they all dismounted and took up encampment.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.11">Musashibō Benkei came bringing an old man.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.12">When the Noble Scion asked, "Who is that?", he said, "He is a hunter of this mountain."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.13">"Then he must know the way.</s>

</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.16">"What do you think about descending from here to the Heike fortress at Ichinotani?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.17">"It is absolutely impossible.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.18">In places called the thirty-jo valley and the fifteen-jo rocky point, there is no way for people to pass.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.19">Much less, horses are unthinkable.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.20">Moreover, inside the castle they have dug pitfalls and planted diamond-spikes to wait for you, I say."</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.22">"Deer do pass through.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.23">When the world becomes warm, saying the grass is deep, the deer of Harima cross over to Tanba; when the world becomes cold, saying they will eat in the shallow snow, the deer of Tanba cross over to Inamino in Harima."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.24">The Noble Scion said, "In that case, it is a riding ground.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.25">Is it likely that where deer pass, horses cannot pass?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.9.3.26">Immediately, serve as guide."</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.10.2.8">Since we pledged that if Narita died, we would die in the same place, thinking 'Let us go,' as we approached together, he restrained me saying, 'Don't be too hasty in the first charge, Lord Hirayama.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.10.2.11">Thinking that was true, I let him go up the small slope first, and pulling my horse's head downward, while I waited for the friendly forces, Narita also came out following; thinking we would ride side by side and discuss the manner of battle, it was not so; he looked coldly at Sueshige, and immediately galloped past; thinking, 'Ah, this person tricked me and intends to charge first,' although he was five or six tan ahead, eyeing him and thinking 'That fellow's horse looks weaker than my horse,' I whipped and whipped my horse and caught up, and shouting 'What a dishonest person to trick someone like Sueshige!', I rode past him and approached; he must be far behind, surely I will not even see his shadow."</s>

Here, Hirayama wore a hitatare with a dense eye-pattern, armor with scarlet lacing, hung a horo cloak with two stripes, and rode a renowned horse called Mekasuge. The standard-bearer wore armor with black leather lacing, a helmet with an iron neck-guard, and rode a rusty-cream horse. "The resident of Musashi Province who charged first in both the Hōgen and Heiji battles, Hirayama Mushadokoro Sueshige!" naming himself thus, he and his standard-bearer, two horsemen, lined up their horses' noses, shouted, and charged.

<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.5">His son Kojirō Naoie also, announcing his age as sixteen, attacked and fought until he thrust his horse's nose against the shield wall, but he had his left elbow shot, jumped down from his horse, and stood side by side with his father.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.16">Hearing this, Etchū Jirōbyōe, as he liked fine attire, wore a hitatare with dark blue shading, armor with red lacing, rode a white-dappled horse, and setting his eyes on the Kumagai father and son, walked his horse toward them.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.17">The Kumagai father and son, determined not to be separated, stood side by side, placed their swords to their foreheads, did not retreat a single step, and advanced ever forward.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.18">Etchū Jirōbyōe, perhaps thinking it hopeless, turned back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.19">Kumagai saw this and said, "Why, that looks like Etchū Jirōbyōe.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.20">Would you choose your enemy?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.21">Press alongside Naozane and grapple, grapple!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.22">Although he said this, saying "Let it be so," he [Etchū] turned back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.23">Aku-shichibyōe saw this and said, "What dirty behavior for a lord," and was about to ride out to grapple, but his armor sleeve was held back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.24">"Our lord's crisis is not limited to this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.25">It should not be," he was restrained, and did not grapple.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.26">After that, Kumagai mounted a spare horse, shouted, and charged.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.27">Hirayama also, in the confusion of the Kumagai father and son fighting, rested his horse's breath and he too followed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.28">On the Heike side, there were few warriors on horseback; the soldiers on top of the towers gathered their arrow-points and shot like falling rain, but the enemies were few, the allies were many; lost in the crowd, they were not hit by arrows.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.29">Although ordered, "Just press alongside and grapple, grapple," the Heike horses were ridden often and fed rarely; they had stood long in ships, and were like carvings.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.30">Kumagai and Hirayama's horses were great horses fed and fed again; if they struck one blow, they would surely kick them all over, so there was not a single warrior who pressed alongside and grappled.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.31">Hirayama had the standard-bearer he valued in exchange for his own life shot, broke into the midst of the enemy, and immediately took the head of that enemy and came out.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.32">Kumagai also took many heads.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.33">Although Kumagai approached first, because the gate was not opened, he did not charge in.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.10.3.34">Although Hirayama approached later, because the gate was opened, he charged in.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.1">Meanwhile, Narita Gorō also arrived.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.2">Doi Jirō charged first, and his force of over seven thousand horsemen raised various flags, shouted and screamed, and attacked and fought.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.3">At the main gate, Ikuta Forest, the Genji had also solidified their position with over fifty thousand horsemen; within that force, there were men called Kawahara Tarō and Kawahara Jirō, residents of Musashi Province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.4">Kawahara Tarō called his younger brother Jirō and said, "Although the great lords do not lower their hands themselves, they take the high renown of their retainers as their honor. For us, if we do not lower our hands ourselves, it is difficult to succeed. While the enemy is placed before us, to sit waiting without shooting even a single arrow feels overly impatient; Takanao intends to first slip inside the castle and shoot one arrow. If I do so, it is unlikely I will return alive, one in ten million. You, remain behind and stand as a witness for the future." When he said this, Kawahara Jirō let tears fall freely and said, "What a regrettable thing you say. If of two brothers, the elder is slain and the younger remains behind alone, how much glory can he sustain? Rather than being slain in different places, let us be together whatever happens." So saying, they called their servants near, sent word of their final state to their wives and children, and without even mounting horses, wearing gaiters and leaning on their bows as staffs, they climbed over the abatis of Ikuta Forest and entered inside the castle.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.5">In the starlight, the color of their armor was not clear.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.6">Kawahara Tarō raised a great voice and announced, "The residents of Musashi Province, Kawahara Tarō Kisaichi Takanao and same Jirō Morinao, are the vanguard of the Genji main force at Ikuta Forest!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.7">On the Heike side, hearing this, they said, "There are no men as terrifying as the warriors of the eastern provinces.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.8">If just two have entered into a great force such as this, what kind of thing might they do?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.9">Good, good, spare them for a while."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.10">Thus there was no one who said to shoot.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.11">Since these brothers were peerless masters of the bow, as they shot rapidly and unceasingly, just when [the Heike] said, "They are hard to spare, kill them!", there were brothers known in the western provinces as strong archers and elite soldiers, residents of Bitchū Province, Manabe Shirō and Manabe Gorō; Shirō was placed at Ichinotani, but Gorō was at Ikuta Forest; seeing this, he drew his bow fully and shot with a whistle.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.12">Kawahara Tarō had his armor breastplate pierced through to the back, and as he clung to his bow-staff and crouched down, his younger brother Jirō ran up, slung his brother onto his shoulder, and was about to climb over the abatis, when Manabe's second arrow struck him outside the tassets of his armor, and they lay down on the same pillow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.13">Manabe's servants met them and took the heads of the Kawahara brothers.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.1.14">When these were entered into the inspection of the New Chūnagon, he said, "Ah, brave men.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.11.2.6">Making the foot soldiers remove the abatis, Kajiwara's five hundred horsemen shouted and charged.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.2.7">Because the second son Heiji Kagetaka advanced to charge too far ahead, his father Heizō sent a messenger saying, "The great general commands that there will be no reward for anyone who charges ahead when the rear force does not follow."</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.11">And he turned back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.12">Kajiwara raised a great voice and announced his name: "I am the descendant of Kamakura Gongorō Kagemasa, who in the old days, during Lord Hachiman's Later Three Years War, when attacking the Senbuku Kanazawa fortress in Dewa Province, at the age of sixteen, charged the very front, had his left eye shot into the plate of his helmet bowl, shot an arrow in return, shot down that enemy, and raised his name for future generations; I am Kajiwara Heizō Kagetoki, a soldier equal to a thousand!</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.13">Those people who think yourselves worthy, kill Kagetoki and show him to your lord!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.14">And he shouted and charged.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.17">As they hemmed him in amidst a great force and attacked, Kajiwara, not knowing his own fate, wondering where Genta was, charged vertically and horizontally, in spider-legs and cross-shapes, breaking through and circling around amidst tens of thousands of horsemen searching; meanwhile, Genta had fought until his helmet was pushed back, had his horse shot, became a foot soldier, and with a cliff of some two jo at his back, hemmed in amidst five enemies, with two retainers standing left and right, without looking back, sparing not his life, he fought in defense, making this his end.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.18">Kajiwara found him: "You are not yet slain!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.11.3.19">He hurriedly jumped down from his horse: "Kagetoki is here; however it may be, Genta, even if you die, do not show your back to the enemy!"</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.2">The arrows shot back and forth were no different from falling rain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.3">There were those who hung the wounded on their shoulders and retreated to the rear.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.8">Either way, no gap could be seen.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.9">Although it was thus, it did not seem that the Genji main force alone could succeed; but the Noble Scion Kurō circled to the rear and at dawn on the seventh day, rode up Hiyodorigoe behind Ichinotani and was about to descend; perhaps startled by that force, two stags and one doe fell down into the Heike fortress at Ichinotani.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.10">Seeing this, the soldiers inside the castle panicked, saying, "Even deer close to villages should fear us and enter deep into the mountains; that deer fall into the midst of such a great force is strange.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.11">No matter how, the Genji are dropping them from the mountain above."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.12">The resident of Iyo Province, Takechi no Mushadokoro Kiyonori, came forward and said, "Whatever it may be, there is no reason to let escape something that has come out from the direction of the enemy."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.13">He shot and stopped the two stags, and let the doe pass without shooting.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.14">The Former Governor of Etchū restrained him, saying, "What a pointless way for a lord to shoot deer.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.1.15">With that one arrow just now, you could defend against ten enemies; it is sinful, and a waste of an arrow."</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.12.2.20">It did not seem like the act of humans at all; it seemed solely the work of demons and gods.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.12.2.21">Before they had finished descending, they raised the war cry with a roar.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.13.2.10">Being told this, perhaps thinking it was true, he said, "I am a member of the original Heike, but because I am unworthy, at present I am a person called the Former Governor of Etchū Moritoshi, who has become a samurai.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.1">Satsuma-no-Kami Tadanori was the great general of the western hand of Ichinotani; he wore a hitatare of dark blue brocade and armor with black thread lacing, and rode a thick and powerful black horse with a gold-flecked lacquer saddle.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.2">Surrounded amidst a force of some one hundred horsemen, he retreated calmly, holding back again and again; Okabe no Rokuyata Tadazumi of the Inomata party, eyeing him as a great general, whipped and stirruped and caught up to him, saying, "Now, what kind of person are you? Announce your name."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.3">When he said this, [Tadanori] said, "This is an ally," and when [Okabe] looked inside the helmet as he looked back, his teeth were iron-black.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.4">Thinking, "Ah, among our allies there are no persons with attached iron [blackened teeth]; it must be a Heike noble."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.5">he pressed alongside and grappled firmly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.6">Seeing this, the soldiers numbering some one hundred horsemen, being temporary warriors from various provinces, did not join in, not even one horseman, and fled, each trying to be first.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.7">Satsuma-no-Kami said, "What evil fellows.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.8">If I say I am an ally, let me say it."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.9">Since he was a man of great strength raised in Kumano and possessed of quick agility, he immediately drew his sword and stabbed Rokuyata twice on the horse and once as they fell and landed, three times in total.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.10">Since the two stabs were on the armor, they did not penetrate.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.11">The one stab thrust into the inside of the helmet, but because it was a slight wound, he did not die; just as [Tadanori] took him, pressed him down, and was about to cut his head, Rokuyata's page boy, galloping up from behind, drew his sword and cut off Satsuma-no-Kami's right arm from the elbow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.12">Perhaps realizing that this was the end, he said, "Stand back for a moment; I will chant the Ten Recitations."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.13">Grasping Rokuyata with his left arm, he threw him away about the length of a bow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.14">After that, facing the west, he chanted the Ten Recitations in a loud voice: "Light shines everywhere, the ten directions of the world; the Buddha gathers those who invoke him and does not abandon them."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.15">Before he had finished speaking, Rokuyata approached from behind and cut off Satsuma-no-Kami's head.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.14.1.16">Although he thought he had killed a fine great general, he did not know his name or who he was; but when he untied and looked at a letter attached to the quiver, there was a single poem composed on the topic "Traveling Lodging Flower."</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.14.2.3">Hearing this, enemies and allies alike said, "Ah, how pitiable; a person who was a master of both martial arts and the way of poetry.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.2">As for the Sanmi Chūjō's attire on that day, he wore a hitatare embroidered with flocking plovers in white and yellow thread on dark blue, armor with purple shading at the bottom, and rode a renowned horse called Dōji Kage.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.3">His milk-brother Gotōbyōe Morinaga wore a hitatare with a dense eye-pattern, armor with scarlet lacing, and was made to ride the Sanmi Chūjō's treasured horse Yome-nashi Tsukige.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.4">Kajiwara Genta Kagesue and Shō no Shirō Takaie, eyeing him as a great general, whipped and stirruped and pursued him.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.5">Although there were any number of rescue boats at the water's edge, the enemy was pursuing from behind, and since there was no gap to escape, they crossed the Minato River and the Karumo River, and viewing the Lotus Pond on the right hand and putting the Grove of Colts on the left hand, they passed Itayado and Suma and fled pointing toward the west.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.6">He was riding a peerless, renowned horse.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.7">Since it did not seem the whipped and exhausted horses [of the pursuers] would catch up, and the distance only grew and grew, Kajiwara Genta Kagesue stood up spreading his stirrups, drew a far-flying arrow thinking "If only," and shot; since he had shot the Sanmi Chūjō's horse deep in the hindquarters and it weakened, Gotōbyōe Morinaga perhaps thought "My horse will be summoned," for he whipped his horse and fled away.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.8">The Sanmi Chūjō saw this and said, "How now, Morinaga? You did not vow thus in years and days past; abandoning me, where do you go?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.9">But pretending not to hear, he ripped off the red badge attached to his armor, threw it away, and fled and fled.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.10">The Sanmi Chūjō [saw] the enemy approaching and his horse was weak; although he rode into the sea, the shallows stretched far and there was no way it would sink, so he dismounted, cut the sash of his armor, undid the cords, took off and discarded his weapons, and was about to cut his belly when, ahead of Kajiwara, Shō no Shirō Takaie galloped up matching whip and stirrup, hurriedly jumped down from his horse, and said, "It is improper.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.11">I will accompany you anywhere."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.1.12">He placed him upon his own horse, tied him to the front pommel of the saddle, and riding a spare horse himself, he returned.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.15.2.2">Without it crying out, he escaped far; later he relied on the Kumano Monk and Onaka Hokkyō, but after the Hokkyō died, when the widowed nun went up to the Capital for a lawsuit, Morinaga accompanied her; since he was the Sanmi Chūjō's milk-brother, he was known to many, high and low.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.2.3">They said, "Ah, the shameless Morinaga.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.15.2.4">Though [Shigehira] treated him with such pity, without sharing his fate in the same place, how hateful that he accompanies an unexpected nun."</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.1">The battle having been lost, Kumagai Jirō Naozane said, "The Heike nobles will be fleeing toward the water's edge, intending to board rescue boats.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.2">Ah, I would grapple with a fine great general."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.3">As he walked his horse toward the beach, a single warrior riding a dappled-grey horse with a yellow-rimmed saddle, wearing a hitatare embroidered with cranes on silk and armor with light green lacing, with the cords of a helmet with hoe-shaped crests tied tight, wearing a sword with gold fittings, carrying arrows with mottled feathers and a rattan-wrapped bow, set his eyes on a ship in the offing and rushed into the sea, causing his horse to swim some five or six tan; Kumagai said, "That looks to be a great general.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.4">What a dishonest person to show your back to the enemy.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.5">Turn back!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.6">When he raised his fan and beckoned, [the warrior] was beckoned and turned back.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.7">As he was about to ride up onto the beach, [Kumagai] pressed alongside, grappled firmly, and they fell with a thud; taking him and pressing him down, he was about to cut his head when he pushed up the helmet and looked: he was about sixteen or seventeen years old, lightly powdered, with blackened teeth.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.8">Since he was about the age of his own son Kojirō, and his face was truly beautiful, he did not know where to drive his sword.</s>

</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.12">When he said this, [the youth] asked, "Who are you? " "I am not a person of significance, but I am the resident of Musashi Province, Kumagai Jirō Naozane," he announced. "In that case, having met you, I will not announce my name. For you, I am a good enemy. Even if I do not name myself, take my head and ask people; they will know."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.13">Thus he spoke. "Ah, a great general. Even if I kill this one person, the battle which is to be lost will not be won.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.14">And even if I do not kill him, the battle which is to be won will surely not be lost.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.15">When Kojirō suffers even a slight wound, Naozane thinks it painful; when this lord's father hears that he has been slain, how much will he grieve?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.16">Ah, I would save him."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.17">Thinking this, he looked sharply behind him, and Doi and Kajiwara followed with some fifty horsemen.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.18">Kumagai held back his tears and said, "Although I wish to save you, the friendly forces are like clouds and mist.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.19">Surely you will not escape.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.20">Rather than having you fall into the hands of others, it is better that I hang you on Naozane's hand and perform memorial services for your afterlife."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.21">When he said this, [the youth] said, "Just take my head quickly."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.22">Kumagai was so full of pity that he did not know where to drive his sword; his eyes went dark and his mind faded, and he felt unaware of before and after, but since it was not a matter that could remain so, weeping and weeping, he cut the head.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.23">"Ah, there is no person as regretful as one who takes up the bow and arrow.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.24">If I had not been born in a martial house, why would I see such a sorrowful sight?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.25">What a heartless thing to kill him," he lamented, pressing his sleeve to his face and weeping bitterly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.26">After quite a long time, since it could not remain so, as he took the armor hitatare to wrap the head, there was a flute in a brocade bag thrust into the waist [of the youth].</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.27">"Ah, how pitiable; at dawn today, those who were playing music within the castle were these people.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.28">Although there are tens of thousands of horsemen in the eastern forces at present, surely there is no person who brings a flute to the battle camp.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.29">The high nobility are indeed graceful."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.30">When he brought it to the inspection of the Noble Scion Kurō, there was no one who saw it who did not shed tears.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.31">Hearing later, it was the son of Shūri-no-Daibu Tsunemori, called Tayū Atsumori; he was seventeen years of age.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.32">It was from this that Kumagai's desire for religious awakening advanced.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.33">As for the said flute, it is said that his grandfather Tadamori was a master of the flute and had received it from the Retired Emperor Toba.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.34">Tsunemori had inherited it, and because Atsumori was talented, he held it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.16.1.35">The name was called Koeda [Little Branch].</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.1">Among the samurai of Echizen Sanmi Michimori Kyō, there was a man called Mita no Takiguchi Tokikazu.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.2">Coming to the wife's ship, he said, "My lord was hemmed in below the Minato River amidst seven enemies and was finally slain. Among them, those who especially lowered their hands and killed him announced themselves as the resident of Ōmi Province Sasaki Kimura Saburō Naritsuna and the resident of Musashi Province Tamai Shirō Sukekage.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.3">Tokikazu also should have shared his fate in the same place and accompanied him in his final moments, but since he commanded beforehand, saying, 'Whatever becomes of Michimori, you must not discard your life; survive no matter what and look after my afterlife,' I have lived a worthless life and heartlessly escaped this far."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.4">Although he said this, the wife did not manage a reply of this or that, but pulled [her robe] over her head and lay face down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.5">Although she heard he was certainly slain, thinking "Perhaps it is a mistake," or "Perhaps he might return alive," she spent two or three days with the feeling of waiting for a person who had gone out for no reason, but when four or five days passed, her reliance on "perhaps" weakened completely, and she became increasingly disheartened.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.6">The nurse lady-in-waiting, who alone attended her, also lay down on the same pillow and sank into grief.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.7">From the evening of the seventh day when she heard this, until the night of the thirteenth day, she did not rise.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.8">When it dawned it would be the fourteenth day; lying there until the evening had passed, intending to arrive at Yashima, as the night deepened and the inside of the ship became quiet, the wife said to the nurse lady-in-waiting, "These days past, I heard that the Sanmi was slain, but I existed not thinking it was true; but since this evening, I have decided that it is indeed so.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.9">Although everyone says he was slain below the Minato River or such, there is not a single person who says they met him alive after that.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.10">On the night when he intended to set out the next day, when I met him in a casual place, looking more disheartened than anything and lamenting, he said, 'In tomorrow's battle, I feel I will certainly be slain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.11">After I become whatever happens, what will you do?'</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.12">But since battle is a common thing, I did not think it would certainly be so; the regret of it!</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.13">If only I had thought that was the limit, why did I not vow for the afterlife? Even to think of it is sad.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.14">Although I hid that my body had become not ordinary [pregnant] and did not speak of it for days, thinking he would not think deeply of me, I spoke of it; he seemed extraordinarily happy and said, 'Although Michimori has reached thirty, I have had no one called a child; ah, let it be a boy.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.15">Just to think of leaving a memento in the floating world.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.16">Now how many months is it?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.17">How is your feeling?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.18">Since it is a dwelling in a ship on the waves without a fixed time, what shall we do when your body becomes split [in labor]?'</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.19">Such words were fleeting promises for the future.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.20">Is it true that at such times, nine out of ten women surely die? It is wretched to meet a shameful experience and die in vain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.21">After my body becomes split safely, I think I would raise the young one and look at it as a memento of the deceased, but every time I look at the young one, I would only long for the person of the past, and though my thoughts would increase, surely there would be no comfort.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.22">In the end, it is a path I cannot escape.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.23">Even if by some wonder I endure this world, in the way of the world that does not follow one's heart, there are unexpected wonders.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.24">This too, when I think of it, is wretched.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.25">If I doze, he appears in my dreams; if I wake, his image stands before me.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.26">Rather than living and thinking somehow that I long for him, I have decided I simply want to enter the bottom of the water.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.27">It is painful that you alone will remain there and lament, but take what attire I have, give it to some monk, pray for the Bodhi of the deceased, and help my afterlife.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.28">Pass on the letter I have written to the Capital."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.29">As she spoke in detail, the nurse lady-in-waiting let tears fall freely: "Abandoning young children, leaving behind aged parents, and accompanying you far to this place; how much do you think of my intent?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.30">Moreover, how could the thoughts of the wives of the people slain this time at Ichinotani be shallow?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.31">Therefore, you should not think of it as a matter for yourself alone.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.32">After you have safely split your body, raise the young person, and even in the cleft of a rock or tree, change your appearance, chant the Buddha's name, and pray for the Bodhi of the deceased.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.33">Even if you think 'definitely on the same lotus,' after you are reborn, in the space of the Six Paths and Four Births, to what path might you proceed?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.34">Meeting him is uncertain, so throwing yourself away is a pointless thing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.35">Moreover, asking who should watch over the Capital and such, why do you speak like this?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.36">It is hateful to hear."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.37">Saying this, she lamented and wept bitterly; the wife, perhaps thinking this matter was heard badly, said, "You should guess that, even against your heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.38">In the sadness of parting from a person, it is the common way to say one will throw oneself away in resentment of the world in general.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.39">But such a thing is a rare instance.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.40">If I truly resolved to do so, I would not do it without letting you know.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.41">The night has deepened.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.42">Come, let us sleep."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.43">When she said this, the nurse lady-in-waiting, feeling sad that a person who had not even looked properly at hot water or water for these four or five days should speak thus, and thinking that she had truly resolved, said, "Generally, the matter of the Capital is a matter as it may be, but if you resolve to do such a thing, please take me with you even to the bottom of a thousand fathoms.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.44">I do not feel I could survive for a moment after being left behind by you."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.45">Saying such things, while she was at her side, in a moment when she dozed off a little, the wife softly got out to the edge of the boat; since it was the vast sea, she did not know which way was west, but perhaps thinking the edge of the mountain where the moon set was the sky of that direction, she quietly chanted the Nembutsu; the plovers crying on the white shoals of the offing, the sound of oars crossing the heavenly door; perhaps because of the moment, sorrow won out; chanting the Nembutsu about one hundred times in a suppressed voice, "Namu, Lord Teacher of the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, Amida Nyorai, without mistaking the Original Vow, guide me to the Pure Land; the relationship of husband and wife that parted without satisfaction, welcome us certainly on the one lotus."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.1.46">Weeping and weeping, lamenting from afar, together with the voice chanting "Namu," she sank into the sea.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.2">Among them, a steersman who was not sleeping saw it and shouted, "How is that? From that boat, a most beautiful lady has just entered the sea!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.3">The nurse lady-in-waiting woke with a start and groped by her side, but since she was not there, she cried out dumbfounded, "Oh no, oh no!"</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.4">Many people went down and tried to pull her up, but even otherwise, as is the way of spring nights, it was hazy, and gathering clouds from all directions came floating, so although they dove and dove, the moon was dim and they could not see.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.5">After a while they brought her up, but she had already become a person not of this world.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.6">She wore a two-layer robe of glossed silk and white hakama.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.7">Both her hair and hakama were dripping wet; though they brought her up, it was in vain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.8">The nurse lady-in-waiting clasped hand in hand, pressed face to face, and said, "Why, if you resolved to this extent, did you not take me with you to the bottom of a thousand fathoms?</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.9">What a hateful person to leave me behind.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.10">Even so, speak one more word and let me hear it."</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.2.11">She fainted and writhed in grief, but <ref target="9.4">[]</ref>[4]she did not manage a single word of reply, and the breath that was faintly passing had already ceased completely.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.19.3.2">The nurse lady-in-waiting, saying she would not be left behind this time, tried to enter following her, but people held her back in various ways, so she could do nothing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.3.3">Perhaps because there was no way to deal with her overwhelming thoughts, she cut her hair with her own hands, had the late Lord Sanmi's younger brother, Chūnagon Risshi Chūkai, shave her, and weeping and weeping, took the precepts and prayed for her mistress's afterlife.</s>
<s xml:id="sent9.19.3.4">Although it is said there have been many since ancient times who were left behind by men, changing one's appearance is the common custom; to go as far as throwing away one's body is a rare thing.</s>

<s xml:id="sent9.19.4.4">Since he did not meet the lady-in-waiting who usually transmitted them, the messenger was returning in vain when, on the road, Kozaishō-dono happened to be going to the Palace from her home; the messenger met her on the road, and frustrated by the intent of returning in vain, ran quickly past the side of her carriage, and threw Michimori's letter inside the blinds of the carriage Kozaishō-dono was riding.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.2.2.8">The Uma-no-Jō rejoiced extraordinarily, and hurriedly entering and looking, felt that [Shigehira] was truly deep in thought; seeing the state of his appearance, which was very withered, it was difficult for Tomotoki to suppress his tears.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.2.2.21">Tomotoki took it and went to the Palace, but since eyes were frequent during the day, he stood in a small hut near that vicinity and waited for the day to end; loitering near the lower entrance of the apartments, he listened; appearing to be this person's voice, [she said,] "Among so many people, that the Sanmi Chūjō should be captured alive and paraded through the main streets!</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.2.4.5">Sanehira, being a samurai with a heart, said, "Truly, if it is a matter of a lady-in-waiting or such, why should it be trouble?" and permitted it.</s>

<div class="tei_blockquote">The Imperial Decree of the fourteenth day of this month arrived at the coast of Yashima in Sanuki Province on the twenty-eighth day of the same, and we have respectfully received it as above. However, considering the matter based on this, Tsunemori Kyō and others, several members of this house, have already been executed at Ichinotani in Sesshū. Why should we rejoice at the pardon of Shigehira alone? Now, our Lord received the abdication of the late Takakura-in, and his reign has already been four years; when we inquire into the ancient customs of Yao and Shun, because the eastern barbarians and northern savages have formed parties and entered the Capital in droves, and the grief of the young Emperor and the Empress Mother is extremely deep, and the resentment of the maternal relatives and close retainers is not shallow, he has traveled to the Nine Provinces for a time. If there is no return, how should the Three Sacred Treasures leave the Jewel Body [the Emperor]? Now, the subject takes the Lord as his heart, and the Lord takes the subject as his body. If the Lord is peaceful then the subject is peaceful; if the subject is peaceful then the country is peaceful. If the Lord grieves above, the subject does not enjoy below. If one grieves in the heart, there is no joy outside the body. Since our ancestor Taira General Sadamori pursued and chastised Sōma Kojirō Masakado, we have pacified the eight eastern provinces, transmitted it to sons and grandsons, punished the plotting subjects who are enemies of the Court, and down to generation after generation, have protected the sacred fortune of the Imperial House. Thus, when my deceased father, the late Prime Minister, was in the battles of Hōgen and Heiji, he weighted the Imperial command heavy and slighted his private life. It was solely for the Lord, and not for himself. In particular, that Yoritomo, in the twelfth month of the first year of Heiji past, due to the rebellion of his father Sama-no-Kami Yoshitomo, although the order was given that he should be repeatedly punished, was the one whom the late Lay Priest Prime Minister out of excess of mercy interceded for and pardoned. However, forgetting the vast favor of the past and possessing no fragrant [grateful] intent, suddenly with a wolf's body he disorderly raises a rebellion like bees; that his utmost stupidity is extreme is needless to say. Is he one who quickly invites the heavenly punishment of the gods, and secretly expects the destruction of defeat? Now, the sun and moon do not dim their brightness for the sake of one thing. An enlightened king does not bend his laws for the sake of one person. Do not discard his good because of one evil; do not cover his merit because of a small flaw. Moreover, if you do not forget the service of this house for several generations, and the repeated loyalty of my deceased father, perhaps the Lord would graciously make a royal visit to Shikoku. At that time, we subjects will receive the Imperial Decree, return again to the old capital, and wipe away the shame of Kaikei. If not so, we shall go to Kikai, Koryo, India, or China. How sad. In the reign of the eighty-first human king, shall the spirit treasures of the Age of Gods of our court finally become the treasures of a foreign country in vain? You should convey these points and report them to the Throne in an appropriate manner. Munemori truly in awe, bowing head, speaks respectfully. Twenty-eighth day of the Second Month of the third year of Juei. Written by Junior First Rank Taira Ason Munemori</div>

<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.1">The Sanmi Chūjō heard this and regretted, "Surely it must be so.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.2">How badly the people of the clan must have thought of me," but it was in vain.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.3">Indeed, since he did not feel that they would return the Three Sacred Treasures, the heavy treasures of our court, regretting the loss of Shigehira Kyō alone, he had anticipated the gist of this written reply from beforehand; but while the situation was not yet stated, he felt gloomy without specific reason; now that the reply had arrived and it was decided that he would be sent down to the Kanto, all his reliance weakened completely, he felt helpless in all things, and he felt the regret of leaving the Capital anew.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.4">The Sanmi Chūjō summoned Doi Jirō and said, "I think I would like to become a monk; how would that be?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.5">Sanehira reported this to the Noble Scion Kurō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.6">When it was reported to the Cloistered Palace, he said, "After showing him to Yoritomo, we will arrange this and that.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.7">How can we permit it right now?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.8">So he reported this reason.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.9">"In that case, I think I would like to meet once more with a holy man I have pledged with for years, and discuss matters of the afterlife; how would that be?" he asked.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.10">"Who is the holy man?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.11">"He is a person called Hōnen-bō of Kurodani."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.12">"In that case, it should be no trouble."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.13">And he permitted it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.14">The Chūjō rejoiced extraordinarily, invited the holy man, and weeping and weeping said, "That I was captured alive this time was so that I should enter the Shōnin's presence again.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.15">Now, how should Shigehira fare in the afterlife?</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.16">While I was myself, I was distracted by service, fettered by administration, and only deepened my heart of arrogance, conversely not looking back at the rise and fall of the future.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.17">Much less, since luck ran out and the world became disordered, fighting here, disputing there, only the evil heart of thinking to destroy others and save myself blocked me, and a good heart never arose.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.18">In particular, regarding the matter of the burning of the Southern Capital, whether called the King's command or military command, since the law of serving the Lord and following the world is hard to escape, I proceeded there to quiet the evil deeds of the monks, and it came to the accidental destruction of the temples; although it was a sequence of events beyond my power, since it is said that the blame returns to the one person who was the great general at the time, I feel it must become the sinful karma of Shigehira alone.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.19">Moreover, that I thus expose my shame here and there unbeknownst to others, I realize is solely the retribution for that.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.20">Now I wish to shave my head, keep the precepts, and earnestly practice the Buddha way, but since I have become such a body, I cannot leave my heart to my heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.21">Since it is a future where I know not today or tomorrow, no matter what practice I perform, it is regrettable that I do not feel I can be saved by a single action.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.22">Considering the transformed acts of my whole life, my sinful karma is higher than Mount Sumeru, and I have not stored up even a speck of dust of good karma.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.23">If my life ends in vain like this, the bitter fruit of the Fire, Blood, and Sword is not to be doubted.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.24">I pray that the Shōnin, giving rise to mercy and bestowing pity, if there is a method by which such an evil person can be saved, show it to me."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.25">At that time, the Shōnin choked with tears and for a while did not speak.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.26">After quite a long time, he said, "That receiving a human body which is truly hard to receive, you should return in vain to the Three Paths, though one grieves, there is still more grief.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.27">However, that now you loathe the defiled land and desire the Pure Land, discarding the evil heart and giving rise to the good heart, the Buddhas of the three worlds surely rejoice.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.28">Regarding that, although the paths of leaving [suffering] are various, for the capacities of the disorderly time of the Latter Law, the recitation of the Name is considered superior.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.29">Dividing the intent into nine grades, and shrinking the practice into six characters, it is convenient for any foolish and dull person to chant.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.30">Do not humble yourself because your sins are deep.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.31">Those of the Ten Evils and Five Grave Offenses achieve birth in the Pure Land if they turn their hearts.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.32">Do not cut off hope because your merit is small.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.33">If you exert a heart of one thought or ten thoughts, He will come to welcome you.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.34">Explaining 'Solely praising the Name goes to the West,' if you solely praise the Name, you go to the West.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.35">Preaching 'Thought by thought calling the Name is constant repentance,' he taught that if you chant Amida thought by thought, it is repenting.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.36">If you rely on 'The sharp sword is this name of Amida,' demons will not approach.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.37">If you keep in mind 'One voice of chanting removes all sins,' it is seen that sins are all removed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.38">The ultimate of the Pure Land sect contains various details, but in general this is the essential.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.39">However, the attainment or non-attainment of birth depends on the presence or absence of faith.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.40">Just believe deeply and do not produce doubt in the least.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.41">If you believe deeply in this teaching, and without disliking time, place, or various conditions of walking, standing, sitting, or lying, and without forgetting the heart's thought and mouth's chanting in the Three Actions and Four Dignities, make the end of your life the term, leave the realm of this suffering region, and are born in that Land of No Retrogression, what doubt can there be?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.42">Because he taught thus, the Chūjō rejoiced extraordinarily and said, "Next, I think I would like to keep the precepts; is it impossible without becoming a monk?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.43">He replied, "It is the common custom of the world that even people who do not become monks keep the precepts."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.44">Making a gesture of applying a razor to his forehead and shaving, he administered the Ten Precepts, so the Chūjō shed tears of joy and received and kept them.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.45">The Shōnin also felt everything was moving, and feeling his eyes go dark, preached the precepts weeping and weeping.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.46">Appearing to be an offering, he had Tomotoki summon an inkstone that had been left with a samurai who had come constantly to play in years past, and presented it to the Shōnin, saying weeping and weeping, "Please do not give this to others; placing it in a place where your eyes will constantly fall, thinking 'This is his thing,' please perform the Nembutsu equating it with me every time you see it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.47">In your spare time, if you would perform a transfer of merit of even one scroll of sutra, it would be appropriate."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.48">The Shōnin did not manage a reply of this or that, but taking it and putting it in his bosom, wringing his black-dyed sleeves, he returned weeping and weeping.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.5.1.49">This inkstone was one that his father, the Lay Priest Prime Minister, had presented much gold dust to the Emperor of the Song Dynasty, and appearing to be a return gift, was sent to 'Taira Great Minister of Wada in Japan,' it was said.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.1">In the meantime, because the Former Captain of the Guards of Kamakura, Yoritomo, had spoken incessantly regarding the Hon-Sanmi Chūjō, saying "Then send him down," he was handed over from the hands of Doi Jirō Sanehira to the lodging of the Noble Scion Kurō.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.2">On the tenth day of the Third Month of the same year, accompanied by Kajiwara Heizō Kagetoki, he was sent down to Kamakura. </s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.3">Having been captured alive in the western provinces, even returning to the Capital was mortifying; now that he was proceeding toward the East of the Barrier, the inside of his heart could be guessed and was pitiable.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.4">When he reached the Shinomiya riverbed, he recalled how in the past, Semimaru, the fourth prince of Engi, cleared his heart in the storm of the Barrier and played the biwa here; and how the person called Hakuga-no-Sanmi walked here for three years—on days when the wind blew and days it did not, on nights when rain fell and nights it did not—and stood listening, finally inheriting the three melodies; imagining the old times of the straw hut's floor, it was moving.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.5">Crossing over Mount Ausaka, letting the horses trample the Karasaki Bridge of Seta with a roar, passing the village of Noji where skylarks rose, the waves of the bay of Shiga hung with spring, Mirror Mountain clouded in mist; putting the high peak of Hira to the north, the bulk of Ibuki approached.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.6">Although he did not intend to stop his heart there, what was rough yet on the contrary graceful were the wooden eaves of the guardhouse at the Fuwa Barrier; how the tide-dried flats of Narumi were; as his sleeves withered with tears, he reached Yatsuhashi in Mikawa Province, where that certain Ariwara composed "wearing a Chinese robe, I have become accustomed [to the journey]," and the spider-leg [branching] path was moving.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.7">As he crossed the bridge of Hamana, the wind was clear in the treetops of the pines, and the sound of waves clamoring in the inlet; even otherwise travel is melancholy, but in the twilight that exhausts the heart, he arrived at the station of Ikeda.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.8">That night he was lodged with Jijū, the daughter of the bathhouse owner of the station headman.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.6.1.9">Jijū, seeing the Sanmi Chūjō, said, "In the past, I did not think of it even in tradition, but the wonder of your entering such a place today," and she presented a poem.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.6.5.3">That he had not a single child, his mother the Nii-dono lamented, and his wife the Dainagon-no-Suke considered it a regrettable thing, and they prayed to ten thousand gods and Buddhas, but there was no effect.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.1">The Captain of the Guards [Yoritomo] hurriedly met him and said, "Now, since I resolved to soothe the wrath of our Lord and wipe away the shame of my father, destroying the Heike was within my expectations, but I did not think that you would properly enter my presence.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.2">In this manner, I feel as if the Great Minister of Yashima has entered my presence.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.3">Now, regarding the destruction of the Southern Capital, was it the command of the late Lay Priest Prime Minister?</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.4">Or was it your own plan at the time?</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.5">It is truly an extraordinary sinful deed."

<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.6">When he said this, the Sanmi Chūjō said, "First, the matter of the burning of the Southern Capital was not the order of the late Lay Priest, nor was it the initiation of Shigehira's foolish mind.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.9">This house has pacified enemies of the court repeatedly since Hōgen and Heiji; the rewards were more than we deserved, and graciously being the maternal relatives of the Lord of the whole heaven, the promotions of the clan numbered over sixty men; for the last twenty years and more, there was nothing but enjoyment and glory.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.10">Now again, our luck has run out, and Shigehira has been captured and come down as far as here.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.11">Regarding that, the saying that for one who kills an enemy of the Emperor, the imperial favor will not be exhausted for seven generations, was an utter falsehood.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.12">Before our eyes, the late Lay Priest Lord was about to lose his life for the sake of the Lord on repeated occasions.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.13">However, with merely the luck of his one generation, should his descendants become like this?</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.14">Thus, after our luck ran out and we left the Capital, I thought I would expose my corpse in the mountains and fields and flow my name on the waves of the western sea, but I did not think even in the least that I would come down as far as here.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.15">I only regret the karma of my previous lives.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.16">However, there is a text saying that Tang of Shang was imprisoned at Xiatai and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.7.1.18">Much more so in the latter age.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.9">When he said this, Senju put down the sake cup and recited the Rōei line "Assuming the heavy robes of silk damask, she resents the heartlessness in the weaver woman" once or twice; the Sanmi Chūjō said, "Kitano Tenjin has vowed to fly three times a day to protect the person who recites this Rōei.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.12">If it is something that might lighten my sins, I shall follow."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.13">When he said this, Senju-no-mae immediately recited the Rōei "Though called the Ten Evils, He welcomes and receives," and sang clearly the Imayō "Those who desire the Pure Land should all chant the Name of Amida" four or five times, so at that time he tilted the cup.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.14">Senju-no-mae received it and offered it to Kanō-no-Suke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.15">When Muneshige drank, she played the koto clearly.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.16">The Sanmi Chūjō said, "Although this music is normally called the Five Constant Pleasures, for Shigehira it should be viewed as the Pleasure of the Afterlife."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.17">Saying he would play the 'Hurry for Rebirth' [Ōjō-no-kyū], he playfully took the biwa, tuned it to the rank-mode [ōshiki-chō], and played the 'Royal Palace Hurry' [Ōjō-no-kyū].</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.18">As the night gradually deepened and his heart cleared in all things, he said, "Oh, unexpected; that there was such a graceful person even in the East.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.19">Whatever it may be, one more voice."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.20">When he said this, Senju-no-mae again sang the Shirabyōshi song "Sheltering together in the shade of one tree, or scooping from the same stream, all these are the karma of former lives," counting the rhythm truly interestingly and clearly, so the Chūjō also recited the Rōei "The lamp goes dark, counting the lines of Lady Yu's tears."</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.21">For example, the meaning of this Rōei is: in the past in China, Han Gaozu and Xiang Yu of Chu disputed the throne and fought seventy-two times; every battle Xiang Yu won.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.22">However, in the end, when Xiang Yu lost a battle and was destroyed, he intended to ride a horse called Zhui that flew a thousand li in a day and flee together with his empress called Lady Yu, but whatever the horse thought, it planted its feet and did not move.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.23">Xiang Yu shed tears and lamented and grieved all night, saying, "My power has already failed.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.24">Now there is no direction to flee.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.7.3.27">As the night deepened, the soldiers raised the war cry on four sides.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.4">When he looked at the holy man's conduct, on the platform of ultimate depth, it seemed he was polishing the jewel of truth; and the sound of the bell in the late night and early morning seemed to wake one from the sleep of birth and death.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.5">If he could escape, he must have wished to be like this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.6">When it dawned, he invited a holy man called Chikaku Shōnin of Tōzen-in and was about to become a monk; summoning Yosabyōe and Ishidō-maru, he said, "Although Koremori has inescapable thoughts accompanying his body, since I am a body difficult to escape on a narrow path, even if I pass away in vain, there are many people in the world these days.</s>

</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.9">When he said this, the two men wept bitterly and for a while could not answer; after a while Yosabyōe suppressed his tears and said, "Shigekage's father Yosa-Zaemon Kageyasu was in the service of the late Lord during the rebellion of Heiji, but he grappled with Kamada Hyōe near Nijō Horikawa and was killed by Aku-Genta.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.10">Why should Shigekage be inferior?</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.12">I was left behind by my mother at seven.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.13">Although there was not a single close relative to pity me, the late Great Minister said, 'That is the child of a person who exchanged his life for mine,' and raised me in his presence; when I was said to be nine years of age, on the night of my lord's coming of age, he took up my hair and graciously said, 'The character Mori is the character of the house, so it attaches to five generations.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.14">The character Shige to Matsuō [Pine King].'</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.15">So saying, he named me Shigekage.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.16">Moreover, regarding my childhood name being called Matsuō, when my father held me and presented me at the celebration of the fiftieth day after birth, saying 'Since this house is called Komatsu [Small Pine], I name him in celebration,' he named me Matsuō.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.19">Thus, even at the time of his end, although he discarded the matters of this world and did not speak a single thing, he summoned Shigekage close to his presence and said, 'Ah, what a pity; you have spent your time thinking of Shigemori as a memento of your father, and Shigemori thinking of you as a memento of Kageyasu.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.20">I thought that in the coming appointments I would make you Yukie-no-Jō and call you as I called your father Kageyasu, but it is sad to die in vain; ensure that you do not go against the Shōshō-dono's heart.'</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.21">Thus he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.22">Therefore, did you think me a person who would abandon you and flee if any matter should arise in these days?</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.23">I am ashamed of the inside of your heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.10.1.24">That I receive your command 'There are many people in the world these days' means, as it is now, they are all retainers of the Genji.</s>

Around the spring of Angen, when that lord was still known as Shii-no-Shōshō, there was a celebration for the fiftieth birthday at the Hōjūji Palace; his father, the Komatsu Lord, was Minister of the Center and Commander of the Left. His uncle, Lord Munemori, was Chūnagon and Commander of the Right, and took his seat below the stairs. Besides them, Sanmi Chūjō Tomomori, Tō-Chūnagon Shigehira, and others—the people of the clan prospered, making that day their clear day; from among those standing by the fence, this Lord Sanmi Chūjō, wearing cherry blossoms in his cap, came out and danced 'Seigaiha'; his flower-like figure flattering the dew, his dancing sleeves fluttering in the wind, illuminated the earth and made the heavens shine too. The Cloistered Empress sent the Kampaku-dono as a messenger and draped a robe over him; his father the Great Minister stood from his seat, received it, placed it on his right shoulder, and bowed to the Cloistered Emperor.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.15">As he continued to think thus, he stopped the Nembutsu, disarranged his joined palms, and said to the Holy Man, "Ah, a person's body is something that should not have things called wife and children.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.29">Even if you maintain an age of one hundred years, this resentment should be thought of as the same thing.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.30">The heretic called the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven possesses the six heavens of the World of Desire as his own, and begrudging that the sentient beings of this world should leave birth and death, sometimes becomes a wife, sometimes becomes a husband, and hinders this; but the Buddhas of the three worlds think of all sentient beings as one child, and try to encourage them into the Land of No Retrogression of the Pure Land; because the things called wife and children have been the bonds transmigrating in birth and death since the beginningless distant past, the Buddha admonishes against them heavily.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.31">Even so, do not think weakly in your heart.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.32">The ancestor of the Genji, Iyo-nyūdō Yoriyoshi, saying he would chastise the barbarians of Ōshū, Abe no Sadatō and Munetō, by imperial command, cut off the heads of over sixteen thousand people in the space of twelve years.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.33">Besides that, the beasts of the mountains and fields, the fish of the rivers; the number of lives he cut off was unknown thousands of thousands.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.34">However, at the time of his end, because he gave rise to the Bodhi-mind of a single thought, I hear he achieved the long-cherished desire for rebirth.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.35">In particular, since the merit of becoming a monk is vast, the sins of previous lives will surely all be extinguished.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.36">Even if a person built a tower of seven treasures reaching to the thirty-third heaven, it cannot reach the merit of one day of becoming a monk.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.37">Even if one made offerings to a hundred Arhats for a hundred thousand years, it is preached that the merit cannot reach the merit of one day of becoming a monk.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.38">Even Yoriyoshi, who was deep in sin, achieved rebirth because his heart was fierce.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.39">Needless to say.</s>

<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.41">Moreover, the Avatar of this mountain is the original ground Amida Nyorai.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.42">Beginning from the vow of no three evil paths, up to the vow of obtaining the three dharma tolerances, there is not one of the individual vows that is not a vow for the conversion of sentient beings.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.43">Among them, in the eighteenth vow, it is preached: 'If I attain Buddhahood, if the sentient beings of the ten directions, with sincere faith and desire to be born in my country, even to ten thoughts, are not born, I will not take correct enlightenment'; thus there is reliance on one thought or ten thoughts.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.44">Just believe deeply and do not produce doubt in the least.</s>
<s xml:id="sent10.12.1.45">If you exert a non-dual earnest thought and chant either once or ten times, Amida Nyorai, shrinking his body of sixty trillion nayuta Ganges-sands, in a form of sixteen feet, surrounded hundredfold and thousandfold by Kannon, Seishi, countless holy multitudes, transformation Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, performing music and singing, will come to welcome you right now out of the eastern gate of Paradise; so even if you think your body sinks to the bottom of the blue sea, you will ascend upon purple clouds.</s>

As for a ship, pushing it back quickly is a serious matter. I should like to place oars at the stern and the bow, insert side rudders, and make it so we can push easily in any direction." When he said this, The Judge said, "Regarding battle, if one intends not to retreat even a single step, yet the alignment is bad, retreating is the usual custom.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.1.6.2">Saying this, he acted as if making preparations, loading weapons and military provisions onto the ships and loading the horses. Then he said, "Do it quickly." But the sailors and helmsmen said, "Although this wind is a tailwind, it is a wind that exceeds the ordinary. In the open sea it must be blowing severely. How can we do this?" When they said this, The Judge became very angry and said, "Whether dying at the ends of fields and mountains, or drowning and perishing at the bottom of the sea and rivers, all this is the karma of previous lives. When venturing onto the sea, what is the use of saying the wind is strong? If I said we should cross against a headwind, that would be wrong. It is a tailwind, and just because it is a little excessive, in this great matter of ours, how can you say we will not cross? If they do not prepare the ships, shoot them to death one by one, you fellows." Thus he ordered. Sato Saburobyōe Tsugunobu of Oshu, Ise Saburo Yoshimori, holding arrows in one hand, stepped forward and said, "Why do you offer details? It is the lord's decision; do it quickly, quickly. If you do not prepare the boats, we will shoot you to death one by one." When they said this, the sailors and helmsmen heard it and said, "Being shot to death is the same thing; if the wind is strong, just die running." So, out of more than two hundred ships, only five ships ventured out and ran. The remaining ships, perhaps fearing the wind or perhaps fearing Kajiwara, all stayed behind. The Judge said, "Just because people do not go, it is not the case that we should stay; in normal times the enemy would also be cautious.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.1.6.3">It is when we push across in such great wind and great waves, when they do not expect it, that we can defeat the intended enemy."</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.2">"Today the sun has set; we cannot decide the victory."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.3">Just as they were withdrawing, a single small boat, beautifully decorated, rowed towards the beach from the open sea.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.4">When it was about seven or eight tan from the shore, it turned sideways.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.5">While they wondered what this was, from within the boat, a lady of perhaps eighteen or nineteen years, truly elegant and beautiful, wearing a five-layer robe of willow combination and crimson hakama, placed a fan with a red sun circle on a pole, set it up on the gunwale of the boat, and beckoned towards the land.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.6">The Judge called Goto Byōe Sanemoto and asked, "What is that?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.7">He replied, "It seems she is saying to shoot it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.8">However, if the Great General steps forward to the arrow path and looks at the beauty, I suspect it is a plot to have a skilled archer aim and shoot him down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.9">Be that as it may.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.12">"Who is there on our side who can shoot it?" he asked.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.13">"Among the many skilled archers, there is Yoichi Munetaka, son of Nasu no Taro Suketaka, a resident of Shimotsuke Province; though he is a small soldier, he is skilled."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.14">"What is the proof?" he asked.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.19">Wearing a hitatare of red brocade with collar and sleeve edges of a different color, and armor laced with light green, he belted a sword with silver fittings; carrying mottled arrows that remained from that day's battle, he carried them high on his back, and attached a whistling arrow with staghorn fittings and hawk feathers mixed with thin mottled feathers.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.20">Holding a rattan-wrapped bow under his arm, he took off his helmet and hung it on the cords, and bowed before The Judge.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.21">"Now, Munetaka, shoot the center of that fan and let the Heike see."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.22">Yoichi reverently replied, "It is uncertain whether I can shoot it.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.23">If I should miss, it would be a lasting disgrace to your side.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.24">Perhaps you should order someone who can do it for certain."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.25"></s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.26">The Judge became very angry and said, "Those lords who left Kamakura and headed for the western provinces must not disobey Yoshitsune's command.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.27">Anyone who harbors even a little objection should return from here quickly."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.28">Yoichi perhaps thought it would be bad to refuse again, so he said, "I do not know about others, but since it is your command, I will try to do it."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.29">Leaving the presence, he mounted a black horse, thick and powerful, with small tasseled cruppers and a saddle rubbed with circular patterns.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.30">Fixing his grip on the bow and gathering the reins, he walked towards the water's edge; the soldiers of his side watched his back from afar and said, "This young man seems certain to do it."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.31">The Judge also looked on with confidence.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.32">Since the arrow distance was a little far, he rode into the sea about one tan, but the fan still seemed to be about seven tan away.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.33">It was around the Hour of the Rooster on the eighteenth day of the Second Month; just then the north wind was fierce, and the waves striking the shore were high.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.34">The boat was tossed up and down and drifted, so the fan also fluttered on the pole without staying still.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.35">In the open sea, the Heike lined up their ships all across to watch.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.36">On land, the Genji lined up their bits to watch this.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.37">There was no one who did not think it a grand spectacle.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.38">Yoichi closed his eyes and prayed, "Namu Hachiman Great Bodhisattva, and especially the gods of my own province, Nikko Gongen of Utsunomiya, and Nasu Yuzen Great Deity, I pray, let me shoot the center of that fan.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.39">If I miss this, I shall break my bow and commit suicide, and never face people again.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.40">If you intend for me to return once more to my home province, do not let this arrow miss."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.41">When he prayed thus in his heart and opened his eyes, the wind had weakened a little, and the fan had become easier to shoot.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.42">Yoichi took the whistling arrow, nocked it, pulled well, and released it with a whistle.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.43">Since he was a small soldier, the arrow was twelve fists and three fingers long, and the bow was strong; it resonated long across the bay, and without error, leaving about one inch from the rivet of the fan, it cut through with a hiss.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.44">As the whistling arrow entered the sea, the fan flew up into the sky.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.45">For a moment it flashed in the empty sky, then tossed once or twice by the spring wind, it fell suddenly into the sea.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.4.1.46">When the crimson fan with the red sun drifted on the white waves, shining in the setting sun, floating and sinking and rocking, out at sea the Heike tapped their gunwales in admiration.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.5.1.13">As the horse fell with a thud like a folding screen being knocked over, the master stepped over the right leg, dismounted to the left, and immediately drew his sword.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.5.1.15">Just when it looked like he would sweep him with the naginata, he did not, but tucked the naginata under his left arm, reached out his right hand, and tried to grab the neck-guard of Mihoya Juro's helmet.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.12.3.15">The Mikoto felt pity, and transforming this maiden into a sacred comb, he stuck it in his hair; he put sake into eight vats, made the figures of beautiful women, and set them on a high hill.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.12.3.17">The great serpent thought they were humans, drank the reflections until satisfied, and lay down drunk; the Mikoto drew the Totsuka Sword he carried and cut the great serpent to pieces.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.12.3.19">The Mikoto thought it strange, and tearing it open with the back of his sword to look, there was a single Spirit Sword.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.12.3.27">At that time, he had the sword re-forged to be his protection.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.2">Now, when he went down to Suruga Province, the rebels of that place deceived him, saying, "There are many deer in this province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.3">Please hunt and amuse yourself."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.4">Bringing him out, they set fire to the fields and were about to burn him to death; the Mikoto drew the Spirit Sword he wore and mowed down the grass; within one ri in every direction, the grass was all mowed down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.5">When the Mikoto set a counter-fire, the wind suddenly blew over toward the rebels, and the evil band was entirely burned to death.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.6">Because of this, the Ama-no-Murakumo Sword was named the Kusanagi [Grass-Mowing] Sword.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.7">The Mikoto invaded further into the interior, and for three years he struck down and pacified rebels in various places, and attacking and subjugating the evil bands of the provinces, he was returning to the capital; but he fell ill on the road, and in the seventh month of his thirtieth year, he finally passed away in the vicinity of Atsuta in Owari Province.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.8">It is strange that his soul became a white bird and ascended to heaven.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.9">The captive barbarians were presented to the Imperial Palace by his son Takehiko-no-Mikoto.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.10">The Kusanagi Sword was placed in the shrine of Atsuta.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.11">In the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Tenji, the Silla monk Dogyo stole this sword intending to make it a treasure of his own country, but while he had it hidden in a boat on his journey, wind and waves shook him and he was about to sink to the bottom of the sea.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.12">Knowing immediately that it was the curse of the Spirit Sword, he confessed his crime and did not accomplish his goal.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.13">He returned it as before.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.14">However, in the first year of Shuchō of Tenmu Tenno, it was summoned and placed in the Imperial Palace.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.15">This is the current Sacred Sword.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.16">Its spiritual power is swift and fierce.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.17">When the Cloistered Emperor Yozei was afflicted with madness and drew the Spirit Sword, the night palace flashed as if with lightning.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.18">In excess of terror he threw it away, and it rang by itself and inserted itself into the scabbard.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.19">In ancient times it was thus miraculous.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.20">Saying that even though the Nun of the Second Rank sank into the sea with it under her arm, it should not be easily lost, they summoned excellent divers to search for it, and had noble priests shut themselves in spiritual temples and shrines to pray offering various sacred treasures, but in the end it was lost.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.21">The experts of that time discussed it, saying: "Long ago Amaterasu Omikami made a vow to protect the hundred kings; since that vow has not yet changed and the stream of Iwashimizu has not yet run dry, the light of the sun has not yet fallen to the earth; even though it is the degenerate Latter Day, surely the end of the Imperial fortune has not come."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.22">Among them, a certain Doctor offered his opinion: "The great serpent that was cut and killed by Susano-o-no-Mikoto long ago at the headwaters of the Hi River in Izumo Province, having a deep desire to regret the Spirit Sword, used the eight heads and eight tails as a sign, became the Child Emperor of the eightieth generation of human kings, took back the Spirit Sword, and sank to the bottom of the sea."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.23">So he spoke.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.12.4.24">Since it became a treasure of the Divine Dragon at the bottom of the thousand-fathom sea, it seems reasonable that it will not return to the human world a second time.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.2">Now that the world had become like this, one might think "come what may," but Dainagon, perhaps still valuing his life, summoned his son Sanuki Chūjō and said, "A box of letters that should not be scattered has been taken by The Judge.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.3">If this is seen by the Genji of the Second Rank in Kamakura, many people will be harmed, and my own life will not be spared; what shall we do?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.4">The Chūjō said, "I hear that The Judge is generally a man of emotion, and moreover, he does not ignore matters where ladies-in-waiting complain and lament, no matter how serious.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.5">Why should it be difficult?</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.6">Since you have many daughters, show him one, and after becoming intimate, perhaps you should ask him."</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.7">The Dainagon shed tears freely and wept, saying, "When I was in the world, I thought of my daughters as [potential] Imperial Consorts or Empresses.</s>

<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.12">But the Dainagon felt that was still too sad, so the daughter of his previous wife, who was twenty-three, was seen by The Judge.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.13">Although she was a little older, since her face and form were beautiful and her heart was elegant, The Judge thought her precious; although he had the daughter of Kawagoe Taro Shigeyori as his original wife, he set this one up in a separate quarter and treated her with respect.</s>
<s xml:id="sent11.15.1.14">Now, when the lady spoke of the matter of the said letters, The Judge did not even break the seal, but hurriedly sent them to Tokitada-kyō.</s>

<s xml:id="sent12.3.2.3">His reputation in the world and the sparkle of his time were splendid.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.3.2.4">Since the wife of the Lay Priest Prime Minister, the Nun of the Second Rank of Hachijō, was also his elder sister, his concurrent offices and positions were as he thought and as he wished.</s>

He has ordered you, monk, to come up and under the guise of a pilgrimage, to deceive and kill me, has he not?" When he said this, Shōshun was greatly surprised and said, "Depending on what, just now, should such a thing exist? Because of a trifling vow, I have come up for the purpose of a pilgrimage to Kumano." At that time the Magistrate said, "Because of Kagetoki's slander, Yoshitsune is not allowed into Kamakura, and without even being granted an audience, I am driven up [to Kyoto]; how is this?" Shōshun said, "How is that matter? regarding myself, strictly there is no duplicity behind me. I shall write and submit a written oath." Because he said this, the Magistrate said, "Be that as it may, if you are thought well of by the Lord of Kamakura..." and saying this, his mood became exceedingly bad. Shōshun, in order to escape immediate harm, while sitting there wrote seven written oaths; some he burned and drank, some he offered to shrines, and having relaxed [Yoshitsune's suspicion], he returned, and circulating the order to the the Great Watch Guards, he intended to attack that very night. As for the Magistrate, he most dearly loved a woman called Shizuka, the daughter of a Shirabyōshi dancer named Iso Zenji. Shizuka also did not leave his side.

<s xml:id="sent12.5.2.7">beginning with Ogata Saburō, and the Usuki, Hetsugi, and Matsura clans, generally the men of Chinzei were granted a letter from the Board saying they should obey his command with Yoshitsune as General; with a force of over 500 horsemen, at the hour of the Rabbit [6 AM] on the 3rd, without making the slightest trouble in Kyoto, and without raising wind or waves, he went down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.5.2.8">A Genji of Settsu Province, Ōta Tarō Yorimoto, said "Can I let them pass right in front of my gate without shooting a single arrow?"

<s xml:id="sent12.5.2.12">The Magistrate cut off the heads and offered them to the God of War, and rejoicing that "The setting out is good," he got on boats from Daimotsu-no-Ura and went down, but just then the west wind blew violently and they were washed up on the coast of Sumiyoshi, and he fled and hid in the depths of Yoshino.</s>

<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.9">Since Kehi Shirō was Asakura Taiyu's son-in-law, he called him and deliberated "How shall we bind him?"</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.10">Deciding "We should bind him in the bathhouse," they put him in the bath, and five or six strong men went down together and tried to bind him, but if they grappled he threw them down, if they got up he kicked them down.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.11">Mutually their bodies were wet, and they could not get a grip.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.12">However, since strong power is no match for the power of a multitude, twenty or thirty men approached, beat and weakened him with the backs of swords and shafts of halberds, bound and arrested him, and immediately presented him to the Kanto; having him dragged into the presence, the details of the matter were asked.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.13">"How is it, while being called a samurai of the same Heike, it appears you are a relative by marriage; why did you not die?"
</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.14">"That is because the Heike were destroyed too easily, so thinking 'perhaps', I was aiming for you.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.15">Thinking of the sharpness of only swords and the sharpness of the steel of arrowheads was for the sake of the Lord of Kamakura, but now that my fate has run out to this extent, it does not extend to saying this or that."

<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.16">"The extent of your intention is imposing.</s>

<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.20">Just, as a favor, quickly take my head."
</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.21">Because he said this, saying "Then cut him,"</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.7.22">they dragged him out to the beach of Yuigahama and cut him.</s>

<s xml:id="sent12.8.8.1">Since the Emperor of that time made amusement his main concern, and the path of government was entirely at the will of Kyō-no-Tsubone, people's laments also did not cease.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.8.2">Because the King of Wu liked swordsmen, those who incurred wounds in the realm were unceasing.</s>

<s xml:id="sent12.8.8.5">Here, Mongaku was originally a fearful Saint, and he meddled in matters he should not meddle in.</s>
<s xml:id="sent12.8.8.6">Since the Second Prince did not neglect his studies and made right principles his priority, he planned by any means to have this Prince ascend to the throne, but while the Former Right General Lord Yoritomo was present it was not granted; when Lord Yoritomo passed away on the 13th of the 1st Month of the tenth year of Kenkyū, immediately as he was about to raise a rebellion, it suddenly leaked out, and officials were attached to his lodging at Nijō-Inokuma, he was arrested, and at over eighty he was exiled to Oki Province. When Mongaku left the Capital, he said "Facing the waves of this much old age, regarding a body that does not know today or tomorrow, even if it is an Imperial censure, that I am not placed in a remote area of the Capital but am exiled as far as Oki Province, the Garden-servant Lad is not peaceful. In the end, I will welcome him to the province where Mongaku is exiled." That he said this was fearful. Because this Lord [Emperor Go-Toba] loved the ball of the Gitchō stick too much, Mongaku spoke abuse in this way. Thus, raising a rebellion in Jōkyū, although there are many provinces, that he was moved to Oki Province is strange. It is heard that even in that province, Mongaku's angry spirit was rough and constantly spoke to him.</s>
