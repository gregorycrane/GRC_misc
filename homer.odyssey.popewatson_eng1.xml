        <head>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</head>
        <p>THE Odyssey, as Longinus observes, is a natural sequel to the Iliad. The Iliad relates the acts of the Grecian chiefs at the siege of Troy; the Odyssey, the adventures and fortunes of most of them after the capture of the city. The Iliad was written, as Longinus supposes, when Homer was in the full vigour of life, and his imagination in its meridian; the Odyssey, when he was declining towards old age, and beginning to delight, like Nestor, in long narrations. The Iliad is accordingly more fiery, the Odyssey more tranquil; and the rhapsodists, in allusion to the character of the two poems, are said to have recited one in robes of scarlet, and the other in robes of purple.<note n="iii.1">Eustath. and Il. i.</note></p>
        <p>That most of the ancients were of the same opinion as Longinus, in regard to the Odyssey having been written soon after the Iliad, and by the same author, is apparent from all that has been handed down to us.</p>
        <p>There arose, indeed, in the time of Aristarchus, a party known by the name of Chorizontes or Separatists, who were desirous to persuade the world that the Odyssey and Iliad were the productions of two different authors. But their notions seem always to have been regarded as heretical; and the sect gradually fell into oblivion. In modern times, however, the German school of Wolf and Heyne has generated a large crop of successors to them, who tell us that the Odyssey, notwithstanding the general resemblance which all the higher order of minds, ancient and modern, have conceived it to bear to the Iliad, cannot have proceeded from the same poet. Their chief arguments are, that the manners of the Greeks in the Odyssey are more refined than in the Iliad; that the arts appear in a higher state of advancement; that Mercury, instead of Iris, is made the Messenger of the Gods; that Venus, instead of Charis, is represented as the wife of Vulcan; and that the attributes of some of the deities as well as the forms of certain words are changed.</p>
        <p>Had we space to examine these arguments fully, we should be glad to state at length why we deem them of very little weight, but at present must limit ourselves to the following</p>
        <pb n="iv"/>
        <p>few observations. We can see no ground for imagining more refinement in the Greeks of the Odyssey, than of the Iliad; for though in the scenes of the Odyssey, which display more of domestic life, the characters naturally appear gentler and more subdued, yet the conduct of the suitors, who hurl bones and footstools in the midst of a banquet, is not more civilized than that of the Grecian chiefs in the field of Troy; and Ulysses' treatment of Melanthius and the offending women is as brutal as Achilles' treatment of Hector. More arts will be found mentioned in the Iliad than in the Odyssey. Mercury is called "message-bearer" at least three times in the Iliad, and in the Odyssey is selected to carry the message to Calypso at the request of Minerva. Venus is called the wife of Vulcan in the Odyssey only in the song of Demodocus, which may refer, as Colonel Mure remarks, to an earlier period in the history of the Olympian deities than that to which the passage of the Iliad which speaks of Charis alludes; and we may suppose Venus to have been divorced from Vulcan after her infidelity with Mars (especially as Vulcan intimates his intention of divorcing her in the song), and Charis to have been her successor. For imagining the characters of the deities to be changed, there appears to be no other cause than that they appear less vigorous and energetic, because they have less active work to do. As to the alleged differences in language, which are acknowledged to be but few, we consider that they are not greater than an author might intentionally make, or than might arise in the language during one man's life-time; and that as much discrepancy might easily be found between the Paradise Lost and Regained.</p>
        <p>Whoever, therefore, by adducing such assumed differences and discrepancies, infers that the two poems cannot have proceeded from the same mind, but that the Odyssey must have been at least a hundred years later than the Iliad, does not enjoy, in our opinion, the privilege of judging Jove <foreign xml:lang="lat">æquo</foreign>.</p>
        <p>The BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE is the oldest known specimen of mock-heroic verse. That it was written by Homer nobody now believes; for it is evidently a burlesque of the Iliad. The crowing of the cock, which is mentioned in it, is considered by Payne Knight a decisive proof that it is not as old as the Iliad and Odyssey: for if that bird, which appears to have been brought from India, had been common in Greece when those poems were composed it would probably have been noticed in them. Suidas and Plutarch attribute the authorship of the poem to Pigres, who made himself known by some other literary performances, one of which was the insertion of a pentameter verse, apparently of a jocose character, after each hexameter of the Iliad.</p>
        <pb n="v"/>
        <head>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</head>
        <p>With respect to the authorship of the Hymns there has been much controversy. But almost all the modern critics, with the exception of Hermann, have concurred in pronouncing that they are not by Homer. Only five of them, those addressed to the Delian and Pythian Apollo, Mercury, Ceres, and Venus, deserve much notice; for the others, though twenty-eight in number, comprise, in all, not more than three hundred and fifty verses.</p>
        <p>The Hymn to the Delian Apollo was cited by Thucydides as the genuine work of Homer, but Thucydides was no professed critic, and may have taken little care to distinguish the genuine from the spurious. Moreover, he appears not to have been followed, in this opinion, by others; for it was a common saying that Homer had left no record of himself; a saying which would not have been true if he had been the author of this Hymn. It has been suggested that it may have proceeded from one of the Homeridæ of Chios, who assumed the tone and character of his great ancestor. It relates the wanderings of Latona in search of a place where she might be safely delivered of Apollo and Diana, her compact with the island of Delos, and the birth of Apollo, who feels himself inspired to become the patron of the lyre and the bow, and to exercise the gift of prophecy.</p>
        <p>The Hymn to the Pythian Apollo was for some time considered as a continuation or sequel to the Hymn to the Delian Apollo. But the two are distinct compositions. It relates the foundation of the temple at Delphi by Apollo himself, the destruction of the serpent Python, and the transformation of the crew of a Cretan vessel into priests for the Delphian temple.</p>
        <p>The Hymn to Mercury is of a humorous and comic character, detailing the tricks played by Mercury, in his childhood, upon Apollo. As it mentions the seven-stringed lyre, the invention of Terpander, it could not have been composed earlier than the thirtieth Olympiad.</p>
        <p>The Hymn to Venus is the most beautiful of the whole. Lucretius, perhaps, took from its commencement the idea of his invocation to Venus. It relates the intercourse of Venus and Anchises, and prophesies that Æneas should be a prince among the Trojans. A fact decisive against its Homeric origin, is, as Clarke observes, that it makes the first syllable of the adjective <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὸς</foreign> short, which, in the Iliad and Odyssey, where it occurs nearly three hundred times, is invariably made long.</p>
        <p>The manuscript of the Hymn to Ceres was found by C. F. Matthæi, in the library of the Holy Synod at Moscow, and transmitted by him, with a short fragment of a Hymn to Bacchus, to the distinguished critic Ruhnken, who published it in 1780. The matter seems too trifling, and the style too deficient in energy, to allow us to regard it as Homer's. The subject is Ceres in search of Proserpine, when she was carried off by Pluto, and the institution of the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>
        <pb n="vi"/>
        <p>Of what is called Pope's Translation of the Odyssey, only one half, as is well known, was executed by Pope. Fenton translated the first, fourth, nineteenth, and twentieth books: Broome the second, sixth, eighth, eleventh, twelfth, sixteenth, eighteenth, and twenty-third; the other twelve, which are on the whole the most spirited, are by Pope himself.</p>
        <p>As Pope was responsible for the entire translation, he made, of course, what corrections he pleased in the work of his coadjutors. Fenton's manuscripts are in the British Museum, and show very few alterations. Broome's are not known to be extant, but Pope complained that they cost him much trouble. All the notes are said to have been furnished by Broome. What revision Pope gave them is unknown.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey of Pope has deservedly taken the same rank in English literature as his Iliad. The grander passages are rendered with the same animation and energy as those of its predecessor; and the entire version is in general more faithful to the sense. Cowper and Sotheby, both of whom were better qualified to represent the calm Odyssey than the more fiery Iliad, may be preferred in parts, but the work of Pope and his auxiliaries as a whole, stands pre-eminent.</p>
        <p>The Battle of the Frogs and Mice by Parnell, and Hole's translation of the Hymn to Ceres, are performances of great spirit and elegance. Chapman's translations of the other Hymns have been much celebrated for their animation, and afford good examples of the state of the English language in the days of Elizabeth.</p>

          <head>MINERVA'S DESCENT TO ITHACA.</head>
          <p>The Poem opens within forty-eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council proposed the method of his departure from thence, and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mentes, king of the Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey, in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following.</p>

          <head>THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.</head>
          <p>Telemachus, in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca, complains of the injustice done him by the suitors, and insists upon their departure from his palace; appealing to the princes, and exciting the people to declare against them. The suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at least till he shall send the queen to the court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father's fortunes. Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses), helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the second day from the opening of the poem.</p>
          <p>The scene continues in the palace of Ulysses, in Ithaca.</p>

            <l>'Reverend old man! lo here confess'd he stands</l>
            <l>'By whom ye meet; my grief your care demands.</l>
            <l>'No story I unfold of public woes,</l>

            <l>'Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown:</l>

            <l>'The great, the good; your father and your king.</l>
            <l>'Yet more; our house from its foundation bows,<lb n="55"/></l>
            <l>'Our foes are powerful, and your sons the foes;</l>

            <l>'Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe.</l>

            <l>'Approach that hour! insufferable wrong</l>
            <l>'Cries to the gods, and vengeance sleeps too long.<lb n="70"/></l>
            <l>'Rise then, ye peers! with virtuous anger rise;</l>
            <l>'Your fame revere, but most th' avenging skies.</l>
            <l>'By all the deathless powers that reign above,</l>

            <l>'Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow</l>

          <head>THE INTERVIEW OF TELEMACHUS AND NESTOR.</head>
          <p>Telemachus, guided by Pallas in the shape of Mentor, arrives in the morning at Pylos, where Nestor and his sons are sacrificing on the sea-shore to Neptune. Telemachus declares the occasion of his coming and Nestor relates what passed in their return from Troy, how their fleets were separated, and he never since heard of Ulysses. They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon, the revenge of Orestes, and the injuries of the suitors. Nestor advises him to go to Sparta, and inquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace. The next morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus.</p>
          <p>The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos.</p>

        <head>THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.</head>
        <p>Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus, to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befel the Greeks since the destruction o Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus, that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso.</p>
        <p>In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus in his voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this: but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima.</p>

    <note n="54.2">2 It may be asked why sorrow for the dead should be more unseasonable in the evening than in the morning. Eustathius answers, lest others should look upon our evening tears as the effect of wine, and not of love to the dead. I fancy that there may be a more rational account given of this expression. The time of feasting was ever looked upon as a time of joy and thanksgiving to the gods; it bore a religious veneration among the ancients, and consequently to shed tears when they should express their gratitude to the gods with joy, was esteemed a profanation.

    <note n="57.1">1 There was a tradition that Helen had the faculty of mimicking persons' voices. Eustathius attributes the power which she showed on this occasion to the inspiration of the "demon anxious for the Trojan doom." "As for the objection concerning the impossibility of the Greeks believing their wives could be in in Troy, Madame Dacier answers, that the authors of this objection have not sufficiently considered human nature. The voice of a beloved person might of a sudden, and by surprise, draw from any person a word involuntarily, before he has time to make reflection." Pope.</note>

        <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
        <head>THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.</head>
        <p>Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus, to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befel the Greeks since the destruction o Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus, that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso.</p>
        <p>In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus in his voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this: but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima.</p>

    <note n="54.2">2 It may be asked why sorrow for the dead should be more unseasonable in the evening than in the morning. Eustathius answers, lest others should look upon our evening tears as the effect of wine, and not of love to the dead. I fancy that there may be a more rational account given of this expression. The time of feasting was ever looked upon as a time of joy and thanksgiving to the gods; it bore a religious veneration among the ancients, and consequently to shed tears when they should express their gratitude to the gods with joy, was esteemed a profanation.

    <note n="57.1">1 There was a tradition that Helen had the faculty of mimicking persons' voices. Eustathius attributes the power which she showed on this occasion to the inspiration of the "demon anxious for the Trojan doom." "As for the objection concerning the impossibility of the Greeks believing their wives could be in in Troy, Madame Dacier answers, that the authors of this objection have not sufficiently considered human nature. The voice of a beloved person might of a sudden, and by surprise, draw from any person a word involuntarily, before he has time to make reflection." Pope.</note>

    <note n="73.1">1 Minerva. Penelope commands a servant to fly with the news of the absence of Telemachus to Laërtes, which could not at all advantage Telemachus and only grieve Laërtes: Euryclea immediately diverts her from that vain intention, advises her to have recourse to Heaven, and not add misery to the already miserable Laërtes: this is wisdom in Euryclea. But it must be confessed that the other is nature in Penelope. Euryclea is calm; Penelope in a passion; grief and resentment give Penelope no time to deliberate, whereas Euryclea is less concerned, and consequently capable of thinking with more tranquillity.

        <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
        <head>THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO.</head>
        <p>Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the island of Calypso; whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, on which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Leucothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phæacia.</p>

        <l>THE saffron morn, with early blushes spread,</l>
        <l>Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;</l>
        <l>With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</l>
        <l>And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light.</l>
        <l>Then met th' eternal synod of the sky,<lb n="5"/></l>
        <l>Before the god, who thunders from on high,</l>
        <l>Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.</l>
        <l>Pallas, to these, deplores th' unequal fates</l>

        <l>Her hero's danger touch'd the pitying power,<lb n="10"/></l>
        <l>The nymph's seducements, and the magic bower.</l>

        <l>'Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent ore,</l>
        <l>'(A richer prize than if his joyful isle</l>

        <l>He spoke. The god who mounts the winged winds</l>
        <l>Fast to his feet the golden pinions binds,</l>
        <l>That high through fields of air his flight sustain</l>
        <l>O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main.</l>
        <l>He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,<lb n="60"/></l>
        <l>Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye:</l>
        <l>Then shoots from heaven to high Pieria's steep,</l>

<argument>
<p>Pallas appearing in a dream to Nausicaa (the daughter of Alcinous, king of Phæacia) commands her to descend to the river, and wash the robes of state, in preparation to her nuptials. Nausicaa goes with her hand-maids to the river; where, while the garments are spread on the bank, they divert themselves in sports. Their voices awake Ulysses, who, addressing himself to the princess, is by her relieved and clothed, and receives directions in what manner to apply to the king and queen of the island.</p>

<head>THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY.</head>
<argument>
<p>THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.</p>
<p>The princess Nausicaa returns to the city, and Ulysses soon after follows thither. He is met by Pallas in the form of a young virgin, who guides him to the palace, and directs him in what manner to address the queen Areté. She then involves him in a mist, which causes him to pass invisible. The palace and gardens of Alcinoüs described. Ulysses, falling at the feet of the queen, the mist disperses, the Phæacians admire, and receive him with respect. The queen inquiring by what means he had the garments he then wore, he relates to her and Alcinoüs his departure from Calypso, and his arrival on their dominions.</p>

<l n="343">Immortal life, exempt from age and woe;</l>
<l n="344">But all her blandishments successless prove,</l>
<l n="345">To banish from my breast my country's love.</l>
<l n="346">I stay reluctant seven continued years,</l>
<l n="347">And water her ambrosial couch with tears;</l>
<l n="348">The eighth she voluntary moves to part,</l>
<l n="349">Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart.</l>
<l n="350">A raft was form'd to cross the surging sea;</l>
<l n="351">Herself supplied the stores and rich array,</l>
<l n="352">And gave the gales to waft me on the way.</l>
<l n="353">In seventeen days appear'd your pleasing coast,</l>
<l n="354">And woody mountains half in vapours lost.</l>
<l n="355">Joy touch'd my soul: my soul was joy'd in vain,</l>

<l n="357">The wild winds whistle, and the billows roar;</l>
<l n="358">The splitting raft the furious tempest tore;</l>
<l n="359">And storms vindictive intercept the shore.</l>
<l n="360">Soon as their rage subsides, the seas I brave</l>
<l n="361">With naked force, and shoot along the wave,</l>
<l n="362">To reach this isle; but there my hopes were lost;</l>
<l n="363">The surge impell'd me on a craggy coast.</l>
<l n="364">I chose the safer sea, and chanced to find</l>
<l n="365">A river's mouth impervious to the wind,</l>
<pb n="115"/>
<l n="366">And clear of rocks. I fainted by the flood;</l>
<l n="367">Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood.</l>
<l n="368">'Twas night, and cover'd in the foliage deep,</l>
<l n="369">Jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep.</l>
<l n="370">All night I slept, oblivious of my pain:</l>
<l n="371">Aurora dawn'd, and Phœbus shin'd in vain,</l>
<l n="372">Nor, till oblique he sloped his evening ray,</l>
<l n="373">Had Somnus dried the balmy dews away.</l>
<l n="374">Then female voices from the shore I heard:</l>
<l n="375">A maid amidst them, goddess-like, appear'd;</l>
<l n="376">To her I sued, she pitied my distress;</l>
<l n="377">Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less.</l>
<l n="378">Who from such youth could hope considerate care?</l>
<l n="379">In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare!</l>
<l n="380">She gave me life, reliev'd with just supplies</l>
<l n="381">My wants, and lent these robes that strike your eyes.</l>

<head>THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY.</head>
<argument>
<p>Alcinous calls a council, in which it is resolved to transport Ulysses into his country. After which, splendid entertainments are made, where the celebrated musician and poet Demodocus plays and sings to the guests. They next proceed to the games, the race, the wrestling, discus, &amp;c., where Ulysses casts a prodigious length, to the admiration of all the spectators. They return again to the banquet, and Demodocus sings the loves of Mars and Venus. Ulysses, after a compliment to the poet, desires him to sing the introduction of the wooden horse into Troy: which subject provoking his tears, Alcinoüs inquires of his guest his name, parentage, and fortunes.</p>
</argument>
<l n="1">NOW fair Aurora lifts her golden ray,</l>
<l n="2">And all the ruddy orient flames with day.</l>
<l n="3">Alcinoüs, and the chief, with dawning light,</l>
<l n="4">Rose instant from the slumbers of the night;</l>
<l n="5">Then to the council-seat they bend their way,</l>
<l n="6">And fill the shining thrones along the bay.</l>
<l n="7">Meanwhile Minerva, in her guardian care,</l>
<l n="8">Shoots from the starry vault through fields of air;</l>
<l n="9">In form, a herald of the king she flies</l>
<l n="10">From peer to peer, and thus incessant cries:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Minerva</speaker>
<l n="11">"Nobles and chiefs who rule Phæacia's states,</l>
<l n="12">The king in council your attendance waits;</l>
<l n="13">A prince of grace divine your aid implores,</l>
<l n="14">O'er unknown seas arriv'd from unknown shores."</l>
</sp>
<l n="15">She spoke, and sudden with tumultuous sounds</l>
<l n="16">Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds:</l>
<l n="17">At once the seats they fill; and every eye</l>
<l n="18">Gaz'd as before some brother of the sky.</l>
<l n="19">Pallas with grace divine his form improves,</l>
<l n="20">More high he treads, and more enlarged he moves:</l>
<l n="21">She sheds celestial bloom, regard to draw;</l>
<l n="22">And gives a dignity of mien, to awe;</l>
<l n="23">With strength, the future prize of fame to play,</l>
<l n="24">And gather all the honours of the day.</l>
<pb n="118"/>
<l n="25">Then from his glittering throne Alcinous rose:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Alcinous</speaker>
<l n="26">"Attend" (he cried) "while we our will disclose:</l>
<l n="27">Your present aid this godlike stranger craves,</l>
<l n="28">Toss'd by rude tempests through a war of waves;</l>
<l n="29">Perhaps from realms that view the rising day,</l>
<l n="30">Or nations subject to the western ray.</l>
<l n="31">Then grant, what here all sons of woe obtain:</l>
<l n="32">(For here affliction never pleads in vain:)</l>
<l n="33">Be chosen youths prepar'd, expert to try</l>
<l n="34">The vast profound, and bid the vessel fly:</l>
<l n="35">Launch the tall bark, and order every oar:</l>
<l n="36">Then in our court indulge the genial hour.</l>
<l n="37">Instant, you sailors, to this task attend;</l>
<l n="38">Swift to the palace, all ye peers, ascend;</l>
<l n="39">Let none to strangers honours due disclaim:</l>
<l n="40">Be there Demodocus, the bard of fame,</l>
<l n="41">Taught by the gods to please, when high he sings</l>
<l n="42">The vocal lay, responsive to the strings."</l>
</sp>
<l n="43">Thus spoke the prince: th' attending peers obey:</l>
<l n="44">In state they move; Alcinoüs leads the way.</l>
<l n="45">Swift to Demodocus the herald flies:</l>
<l n="46">At once the sailors to their charge arise:</l>
<l n="47">They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails,</l>
<l n="48">And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales;</l>
<l n="49">Then to the palace move: a gathering throng,</l>
<l n="50">Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along.</l>
<l n="51">Now all accesses to the dome are fill'd;</l>
<l n="52">Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill'd:</l>
<l n="53">Two beeves, twelve fatlings, from the flock they bring</l>
<l n="54">To crown the feast; so wills the bounteous king.</l>
<l n="55">The herald now arrives, and guides along</l>
<l n="56">The sacred master of celestial song;</l>
<l n="57">Dear to the Muse! who gave his days to flow</l>
<l n="58">With mighty blessings, mix'd with mighty woe;</l>
<l n="59">With clouds of darkness quench'd his visual ray,</l>
<l n="60">But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay.<ref n="118.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="61">High on a radiant throne, sublime in state,</l>
<l n="62">Encircled by huge multitudes, he sate:</l>

<pb n="119"/>
<l n="63">With silver shone the throne: his lyre, well strung</l>
<l n="64">To rapturous sounds, at hand Pontonoüs hung:</l>
<l n="65">Before his seat a polish'd table shines,</l>
<l n="66">And a full goblet foams with generous wines:</l>
<l n="67">His food a herald bore: and now they fed;</l>
<l n="68">And now the rage of craving hunger fled.</l>
<l n="69">Then, fir'd by all the Muse, aloud he sings</l>
<l n="70">The mighty deeds of demi-gods and kings:</l>
<l n="71">From that fierce wrath the noble song arose,</l>
<l n="72">That made Ulysses and Achilles foes:</l>
<l n="73">How o'er the feast they doom the fall of Troy;</l>
<l n="74">The stern debate Atrides hears with joy:<ref n="119.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="75">For heaven foretold the contest, when he trod</l>
<l n="76">The marble threshold of the Delphic god,</l>
<l n="77">Curious to learn the counsels of the sky,</l>
<l n="78">Ere yet he loos'd the rage of war on Troy.</l>
<l n="79">Touch'd at the song, Ulysses straight resign'd</l>
<l n="80">To soft affliction all his manly mind.</l>
<l n="81">Before his eyes the purple vest he drew,</l>
<l n="82">Industrious to conceal the falling dew:</l>
<l n="83">But when the music paus'd, he ceas'd to shed</l>
<l n="84">The flowing tear, and rais'd his drooping head;</l>
<l n="85">And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown'd,</l>
<l n="86">He pour'd a pure libation to the ground.</l>
<l n="87">Transported with the song, the listening train</l>
<l n="88">Again with loud applause demand the strain:</l>
<l n="89">Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head,</l>
<l n="90">Again unmann'd, a shower of sorrows shed;</l>
<l n="91">Conceal'd he wept: the king observ'd alone</l>
<l n="92">The silent tear, and heard the secret groan:</l>
<l n="93">Then to the bard aloud: "O cease to sing,</l>
<l n="94">Dumb be thy voice, and mute th' harmonious string:</l>
<l n="95">Enough the feast has pleas'd, enough the power</l>
<l n="96">Of heavenly song has crown'd the genial hour!</l>
<note n="119.1">Before the opening of the war of Troy, Agamemnon consulted the oracle concerning the issue of it; Apollo answered, that Troy should be taken when two princes most renowned, the one for valour and the other for wisdom, should contend at a sacrifice of the gods; after the death of Hector, a contest arose between Achilles and Ulysses, whether force or stratagem should be employed to take the city; Agamemnon rejoiced to see the prediction fulfilled, knowing that the destruction of Troy was at hand, the oracle being accomplished by the contest of Ulysses and Achilles.

<l n="97">Incessant in the games your strength display,</l>

<l n="105">Thus spoke the king: th' attending peers obey;</l>
<l n="106">In state they move, Alcinous leads the way:</l>

<l n="113">The games begin: ambitious of the prize,</l>
<l n="114">Acroneus, Thoön, and Eretmeus rise;</l>
<l n="115">The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim,</l>
<l n="116">Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame.</l>
<l n="117">There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear,</l>

<l n="119">Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose,</l>
<l n="120">When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes;</l>
<l n="121">Naubolides with grace unequall'd shone,</l>
<l n="122">Or equall'd by Laodamas alone.</l>
<l n="123">With these came forth Ambasineus the strong:</l>

<l n="125">Ranged in a line the ready racers stand,</l>
<l n="126">Start from the goal, and vanish o'er the strand:</l>
<l n="127">Swift as on wings of wind, upborne they fly,</l>

<l n="131">Clytoneus sprung: he winged the rapid way,</l>
<l n="132">And bore th' unrivall'd honours of the day.</l>
<note n="120.1">Aristarchus, as Didymus informs us, thus interprets Homer, "As much as a yoke of mules set to work at the same time with a yoke of oxen, outgoes the oxen, (for mules are swifter than oxen,) so much Clytoneus outwent his competitors."</note>

<l n="272">Fear only fools, secure in men of sense;</l>

<l n="279">How, lov'd of Jove, he crown'd our sires with praise,</l>
<l n="280">How we their offspring dignify our race.</l>
<l n="281">Let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield,</l>
<l n="282">Or boast the glories of th' athletic field;</l>
<note n="124.1">A king of Œchalia, who defied even Apollo to equal him in archery.</note>
<note n="124.2">This is directly contrary to his challenge in the beginning of the speech, where he mentions the race amongst the other games. How then is this difference to be reconciled? Very naturally. Ulysses speaks with a generous warmth, and is transported with anger in the beginning of his oration. Here the heat of it is cooled, and consequently reason takes place, and he has time to reflect, that a man so disabled by calamities is not an equal match for a younger and less fatigued antagonist. This is an exact representation of human nature; when our passions remit, the vehemence of our speech remits; at first he speaks like a man in anger, here like the wise Ulysses. Pope.</note>

<l n="548">In every land thy monument of praise."</l>
</sp>
<l n="549">Full of the god he rais'd his lofty strain,</l>
<l n="550">How the Greeks rush'd tumultuous to the main;</l>
<l n="551">How blazing tents illumin'd half the skies,</l>
<l n="552">While from the shores the winged navy flies;</l>
<l n="553">How even in Ilion's walls, in deathful bands,</l>
<l n="554">Came the stern Greeks by Troy's assisting hands:</l>
<l n="555">All Troy up-heav'd the steed; of differing mind,</l>
<l n="556">Various the Trojans counsell'd: part consign'd</l>

<l n="557">The monster to the sword; part sentence gave</l>
<l n="558">To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave;</l>
<l n="559">Th' unwise award to lodge it in the towers,</l>
<l n="560">An offering sacred to th' immortal powers:</l>
<l n="561">Th' unwise prevail, they lodge it in the walls,</l>
<l n="562">And by the gods' decree proud Ilion falls:</l>
<l n="563">Destruction enters in the treacherous wood,</l>
<l n="564">And vengeful slaughter, fierce for human blood.</l>
<l n="565">He sung the Greeks stern-issuing from the steed,</l>
<l n="566">How Ilion burns, how all her fathers bleed;</l>
<l n="567">How to thy dome, Deïphobus, ascends</l>
<l n="568">The Spartan king; how Ithacus attends</l>
<l n="569">Horrid as Mars, and how with dire alarms</l>
<l n="570">He fights, subdues; for Pallas strings his arms.</l>
<l n="571">Thus while he sung, Ulysses' griefs renew,</l>
<l n="572">Tears bathe his cheeks, and tears the ground bedew:</l>
<l n="573">As some fond matron views in mortal fight</l>
<l n="574">Her husband falling in his country's right:</l>
<l n="575">Frantic through clashing swords she runs, she flies,</l>
<l n="576">As ghastly pale he groans, and faints, and dies;</l>
<l n="577">Close to his breast she grovels on the ground,</l>
<l n="578">And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound:</l>
<l n="579">She cries, she shrieks: the fierce insulting foe</l>
<l n="580">Relentless mocks her violence of woe:</l>
<l n="581">To chains condemn'd, as wildly she deplores;</l>
<l n="582">A widow, and a slave on foreign shores.</l>
<l n="583">So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes</l>
<l n="584">Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs:</l>
<l n="585">Conceal'd he griev'd: the king observ'd alone</l>
<l n="586">The silent tear and heard the secret groan:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Alcinous</speaker>
<l n="587">Then to the bard aloud: "O cease to sing,</l>
<l n="588">Dumb be thy voice, and mute the tuneful string;</l>
<l n="589">To every note his tears responsive flow,</l>
<l n="590">And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe;</l>
<l n="591">Thy lay too deeply moves: then cease the lay,</l>
<l n="592">And o'er the banquet every heart be gay:</l>
<l n="593">This social right demands: for him the sails,</l>
<l n="594">Floating in air, invite th' impelling gales:</l>

<note n="134.1">This book takes up the whole thirty-third day, and part of the evening; for the council opens in the morning, and at sun-setting the Phæacians return to the palace from the games; after which Ulysses bathes and sups, and spends some time of the evening in discoursing, and hearing the songs of Demodocus.

<head>THE NINTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY.</head>
<argument>
<p>THE ADVENTURES OF THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI, AND CYCLOPS.</p>
<p>Ulysses begins the relations of his adventures; how, after the destruction of Troy, he with his companions made an incursion on the Cicons, by whom they were repulsed; and meeting with a storm, were driven to the coast of the Lotophagi. From thence they sailed to the land of the Cyclops, whose manners and situation are particularly characterized. The giant Polyphemus and his cave described; the usage Ulysses and his companions met with there; and lastly, the method and artifice by which he escaped.</p>

<l n="1">THEN thus Ulysses: "Thou whom first in sway,</l>
<l n="2">As first in virtue, these thy realms obey;</l>
<l n="3">How sweet the products of a peaceful reign!</l>
<l n="4">The heaven-taught poet, and enchanting strain;</l>
<l n="5">The well-fill'd palace, the perpetual feast,</l>
<l n="6">A land rejoicing, and a people bless'd:</l>
<l n="7">How goodly seems it ever to employ</l>
<l n="8">Man's social days in union and in joy;</l>
<l n="9">The plenteous board high-heap'd with cates divine,</l>

<l n="12">Th' unhappy series of a wanderer's woe?</l>
<l n="13">Remembrance sad, whose image to review,</l>
<l n="14">Alas! must open all my wounds anew!</l>

<l n="15">And oh, what first, what last shall I relate,</l>
<l n="16">Of woes unnumber'd sent by Heaven and Fate?</l>
<l n="17">Know first the man (though now a wretch distress'd)</l>
<l n="18">Who hopes thee, monarch, for his future guest:</l>
<l n="19">Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name,</l>
<l n="20">Earth sounds my wisdom, and high heaven my fame.<ref n="135.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="21">My native soil is Ithaca the fair,</l>
<l n="22">Where high Neritus waves his woods in air;</l>
<l n="23">Dulichium, Samè, and Zacynthus crown'd</l>
<l n="24">With shady mountains, spread their isles around;</l>
<l n="25">(These to the north and night's dark regions run,</l>
<l n="26">Those to Aurora and the rising sun.)</l>
<l n="27">Low lies our isle, yet bless'd in fruitful stores;</l>
<l n="28">Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores;</l>
<l n="29">And none, ah none, so lovely to my sight,</l>
<l n="30">Of all the lands that heaven o'erspreads with light!</l>
<l n="31">In vain Calypso long constrain'd my stay,</l>
<l n="32">With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;</l>
<l n="33">With all her charms as vainly Circe strove,</l>
<l n="34">And added magic to secure my love.</l>
<l n="35">In pomps or joys, the palace or the grot,</l>
<l n="36">My country's image never was forgot,</l>
<l n="37">My absent parents rose before my sight,</l>
<l n="38">And distant lay contentment and delight.</l>
<l n="39">Hear, then, the woes which mighty Jove ordain'd</l>
<l n="40">To wait my passage from the Trojan land.</l>
<l n="41">The winds from Ilion to the Cicons' shore,<ref n="135.2">2</ref></l>
<l n="42">Beneath cold Ismarus, our vessels bore.</l>
<l n="43">We boldly landed on the hostile place,</l>
<l n="44">And sack'd the city, and destroy'd the race,</l>
<l n="45">Their wives made captive, their possessions shar'd,</l>
<l n="46">And every soldier found a like reward.</l>
<note n="135.1">Perhaps it may be thought that Ulysses speaks of himself too favourably; but we must consider that Ulysses had nothing but his personal qualifications to engage the Phæacians in his favour. It was therefore requisite to make those qualifications known, and this was not possible to be done but by his own relation, he being a stranger among strangers. Pope. Virgil's Æneas speaks of himself in the same way: Sum pius Æneas—famâ super æthera notus.</note>
<note n="135.2">A people of Thrace, near the river Hebrus. It appears from the second book of the Iliad, observes Eustathius, that they were the auxiliaries of Troy, and therefore Ulysses attacks them as enemies.</note>
<pb n="136"/>
<l n="47">I then advis'd to fly; not so the rest,</l>
<l n="48">Who stay'd to revel, and prolong the feast:</l>
<l n="49">The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay,</l>
<l n="50">And bowls flow round, and riot wastes the day.</l>
<l n="51">Meantime the Cicons, to their holds retir'd,</l>
<l n="52">Call on the Cicons, with new fury fir'd;</l>
<l n="53">With early morn the gather'd country swarms,</l>
<l n="54">And all the continent is bright with arms;</l>
<l n="55">Thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers</l>
<l n="56">O'erspread the land, when spring descends in showers:</l>
<l n="57">All expert soldiers, skill'd on foot to dare,</l>
<l n="58">Or from the bounding courser urge the war.</l>
<l n="59">Now fortune changes (so the Fates ordain);</l>
<l n="60">Our hour was come to taste our share of pain.</l>
<l n="61">Close at the ships the bloody fight began,</l>
<l n="62">Wounded they wound, and man expires on man.</l>
<l n="63">Long as the morning sun increasing bright</l>
<l n="64">O'er heaven's pure azure spread the growing light,</l>
<l n="65">Promiscuous death the form of war confounds,</l>
<l n="66">Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds;</l>
<l n="67">But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,</l>
<l n="68">Then conquest crown'd the fierce Ciconian train.</l>
<l n="69">Six brave companions from each ship we lost,<ref n="136.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="70">The rest escape in haste, and quit the coast.</l>
<l n="71">With sails outspread we fly th' unequal strife,</l>
<l n="72">Sad for their loss, but joyful of our life.</l>
<l n="73">Yet as we fled, our fellows' rites we paid,<ref n="136.2">2</ref></l>
<l n="74">And thrice we call'd on each unhappy shade.</l>
<l n="75">Meanwhile the god, whose hand the thunder forms,</l>
<l n="76">Drives clouds on clouds, and blackens heaven with storms,</l>
<l n="77">Wide o'er the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps,</l>
<l n="78">And night rush'd headlong on the shaded deeps.</l>
<l n="79">Now here, now there, the giddy ships are borne,</l>
<l n="80">And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn.</l>
<note n="136.1">Zoilus sneered at this passage, from the improbability that exactly six men would be lost out of each vessel. But Eustathius and others suppose it is meant that an average of six from each ship were lost, or seventy-two in all.</note>
<note n="136.2">By erecting a cenotaph on some part of the shore; a solemnity which was supposed to facilitate the entrance of the souls of the dead into the Elysian fields.</note>
<pb n="137"/>
<l n="81">We furl'd the sail, we plied the labouring oar,</l>
<l n="82">Took down our masts, and row'd our ships to shore.</l>
<l n="83">Two tedious days, and two long nights we lay,</l>
<l n="84">O'erwatch'd and batter'd in the naked bay.</l>
<l n="85">But the third morning when Aurora brings,</l>
<l n="86">We rear the masts, we spread the canvas wings;</l>
<l n="87">Refresh'd and careless on the deck reclin'd,</l>
<l n="88">We sit, and trust the pilot and the wind.</l>
<l n="89">Then to my native country had I sail'd:</l>
<l n="90">But, the cape doubled, adverse winds prevail'd.</l>
<l n="91">Strong was the tide, which, by the northern blast</l>
<l n="92">Impell'd, our vessels on Cythera cast.</l>
<l n="93">Nine days our fleet th' uncertain tempest bore</l>
<l n="94">Far in wide ocean, and from sight of shore:</l>
<l n="95">The tenth we touch'd, by various errors toss'd,</l>
<l n="96">The land of Lotus,<ref n="137.1">1</ref> and the flowery coast.</l>
<l n="97">We climb'd the beach, and springs of water found,</l>
<l n="98">Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground.</l>
<l n="99">Three men were sent, deputed from the crew</l>
<l n="100">(A herald one) the dubious coast to view,</l>
<l n="101">And learn what habitants possessed the place.</l>
<l n="102">They went, and found a hospitable race:</l>
<l n="103">Not prone to ill, nor strange to foreign guest,</l>
<l n="104">They eat, they drink, and nature gives the feast:</l>
<l n="105">The trees around them all their food produce;</l>
<l n="106">Lotus the name: divine, nectareous juice!</l>
<l n="107">(Thence called Lotophagi;) which whoso tastes,</l>
<l n="108">Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts,</l>
<l n="109">Nor other home nor other care intends,</l>
<l n="110">But quits his house, his country, and his friends.</l>
<l n="111">The three we sent, from off th' enchanting ground</l>
<l n="112">We dragged reluctant, and by force we bound:</l>
<note n="137.1">Homer's Lotophagi, or Lotus-eaters, dwelt somewhere on the coast of the Mediterranean, but it is uncertain where. The ancients distinguished two kinds of fruit or vegetables by the term lotus; one was an aquatic plant, which grew on the coast of Egypt, and of which the seeds and root were eaten; the other a sort of sweet date-plum, which was found on the northern coast of Africa, between the two Syrtes, where, as this is generally supposed to have been Homer's lotus, many of the Greeks in consequence supposed that the Lotophagi had their abode.</note>
<pb n="138"/>
<l n="113">The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore,</l>
<l n="114">Or, the charm tasted, had return'd no more.</l>
<l n="115">Now placed in order on their banks, they sweep</l>
<l n="116">The sea's smooth face, and cleave the hoary deep;</l>
<l n="117">With heavy hearts we labour through the tide,</l>
<l n="118">To coasts unknown, and oceans yet untried.</l>
<l n="119">The land of Cyclops<ref n="138.1">1</ref> first, a savage kind,</l>
<l n="120">Nor tam'd by manners, nor by laws confin'd:</l>
<l n="121">Untaught to plant, to turn the glebe and sow;</l>
<l n="122">They all their products to free nature owe.</l>
<l n="123">The soil untill'd a ready harvest yields,</l>
<l n="124">With wheat and barley wave the golden fields;</l>
<l n="125">Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour,</l>
<l n="126">And Jove descends in each prolific shower.</l>
<l n="127">By these no statutes and no rights are known,</l>
<l n="128">No council held, no monarch fills the throne,</l>
<l n="129">But high on hills, or airy cliffs, they dwell,</l>
<l n="130">Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell.</l>
<l n="131">Each rules his race, his neighbour not his care,</l>
<l n="132">Heedless of others, to his own severe.</l>
<l n="133">Oppos'd to the Cyclopean coasts, there lay</l>
<l n="134">An isle, whose hills their subject fields survey;</l>
<l n="135">Its name Lachæa,<ref n="138.2">2</ref> crown'd with many a grove,</l>
<l n="136">Where savage goats through pathless thickets rove:</l>
<l n="137">No needy mortals here, with hunger bold,</l>
<l n="138">Or wretched hunters through the wintry cold</l>
<l n="139">Pursue their flight; but leave them safe to bound</l>
<l n="140">From hill to hill, o'er all the desert ground.</l>
<l n="141">Nor knows the soil to feed the fleecy care,</l>
<l n="142">Or feels the labours of the crooked share;</l>
<l n="143">But uninhabited, untill'd, unsown</l>
<l n="144">It lies, and breeds the bleating goat alone.</l>
<l n="145">For there no vessel with vermilion prore,</l>

<l n="161">High at the head from out the cavern'd rock,</l>
<l n="162">In living rills a gushing fountain broke:</l>

<l n="165">Hither some favouring god, beyond our thought,</l>

<l n="174">Soon as again the rosy morning shone,</l>
<l n="175">Reveal'd the landscape and the scene unknown,</l>
<l n="176">With wonder seiz'd, we view the pleasing ground,</l>
<l n="177">And walk delighted, and expatiate round.</l>
<l n="178">Rous'd by the woodland nymphs at early dawn,</l>
<l n="179">The mountain goats came bounding o'er the lawn:</l>
<l n="180">In haste our fellows to the ships repair,</l>
<l n="181">For arms and weapons of the sylvan war;</l>
<l n="182">Straight in three squadrons all our crew we part,</l>
<l n="183">And bend the bow, or wing the missile dart;</l>
<l n="184">The bounteous gods afford a copious prey,</l>
<l n="185">And nine fat goats each vessel bears away:</l>
<l n="186">The royal bark had ten. Our ships complete</l>
<l n="187">We thus supplied (for twelve were all the fleet).</l>
<l n="188">Here, till the setting sun roll'd down the light,</l>
<l n="189">We sat indulging in the genial rite:</l>
<pb n="140"/>
<l n="190">Nor wines were wanting; those from ample jars</l>
<l n="191">We drain'd, the prize of our Ciconian wars.</l>
<l n="192">The land of Cyclops lay in prospect near;</l>
<l n="193">The voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear,</l>
<l n="194">And from their mountains rising smokes appear.</l>
<l n="195">Now sunk the sun, and darkness cover'd o'er</l>
<l n="196">The face of things: along the sea-beat shore</l>
<l n="197">Satiate we slept; but when the sacred dawn</l>
<l n="198">Arising glitter'd o'er the dewy lawn,</l>
<l n="199">I call'd my fellows, and these words address'd:</l>
<l n="200">"My dear associates here indulge your rest:</l>
<l n="201">While, with my single ship, adventurous I</l>
<l n="202">Go forth, the manners of yon men to try;</l>
<l n="203">Whether a race unjust, of barbarous might,</l>
<l n="204">Rude, and unconscious of a stranger's right;</l>
<l n="205">Or such who harbour pity in their breast,</l>
<l n="206">Revere the gods, and succour the distress'd."</l>
<l n="207">This said, I climb'd my vessel's lofty side;</l>
<l n="208">My train obey'd me, and the ship untied.</l>
<l n="209">In order seated on their banks, they sweep</l>
<l n="210">Neptune's smooth face, and cleave the yielding deep.</l>
<l n="211">When to the nearest verge of land we drew,</l>

<l n="213">High, and with darkening laurels covered o'er;</l>
<l n="214">Where sheep and goats lay slumbering round the shore.</l>
<l n="215">Near this, a fence of marble from the rock,</l>

<l n="217">A giant shepherd here his flock maintains</l>
<l n="218">Far from the rest, and solitary reigns,</l>

<l n="221">A form enormous! far unlike the race</l>
<l n="222">Of human birth, in stature, or in face;</l>
<l n="223">As some lone mountain's monstrous growth he stood,</l>
<l n="224">Crown'd with rough thickets, and a nodding wood.</l>
<l n="225">I left my vessel at the point of land,</l>
<l n="226">And close to guard it gave our crew command:</l>
<l n="227">With only twelve, the boldest and the best,</l>
<l n="228">I seek th' adventure, and forsake the rest.</l>
<pb n="141"/>
<l n="229">Then took a goatskin, fill'd with precious wine,</l>
<l n="230">The gift of Maron of Evantheus' line;</l>
<l n="231">(The priest of Phœbus at th' Ismarian shrine.<ref n="141.1">1</ref>)</l>
<l n="232">In sacred shade his honour'd mansion stood</l>
<l n="233">Amidst Apollo's consecrated wood;</l>
<l n="234">Him, and his house, heaven moved my mind to save,</l>
<l n="235">And costly presents in return he gave;</l>
<l n="236">Seven golden talents to perfection wrought,</l>
<l n="237">A silver bowl that held a copious draught,</l>
<l n="238">And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine,</l>
<l n="239">Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine!</l>
<l n="240">Which now, some ages from his race conceal'd,</l>
<l n="241">The hoary sire in gratitude reveal'd.</l>
<l n="242">Such was the wine: to quench whose fervent steam</l>
<l n="243">Scarce twenty measures from the living stream</l>
<l n="244">To cool one cup sufficed: the goblet crown'd</l>
<l n="245">Breathed aromatic fragrances around.</l>
<l n="246">Of this an ample vase we heav'd aboard,</l>
<l n="247">And brought another with provisions stor'd.</l>
<l n="248">My soul foreboded I should find the bower</l>
<l n="249">Of some fell monster, fierce with barbarous power;</l>
<l n="250">Some rustic wretch, who liv'd in heaven's despite,</l>
<l n="251">Contemning laws, and trampling on the right.</l>
<l n="252">The cave we found, but vacant all within;</l>
<l n="253">(His flock the giant tended on the green:)</l>
<l n="254">But round the grot we gaze; and all we view,</l>
<l n="255">In order ranged, our admiration drew:</l>
<l n="256">The bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd,</l>
<l n="257">The folded flocks each separate from the rest;</l>
<l n="258">(The larger here, and there the lesser lambs,</l>
<l n="259">The new-fall'n young here bleating for their dams;</l>
<l n="260">The kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies:)</l>
<l n="261">The cavern echoes with responsive cries.</l>
<l n="262">Capacious chargers all around were laid,</l>
<l n="263">Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade.</l>
<l n="264">With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store</l>
<l n="265">My friends advise me, and to quit the shore;</l>
<l n="266">Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away,</l>
<l n="267">Consult our safety, and put off to sea.</l>
<note n="141.1">See ver. 42.</note>
<pb n="142"/>
<l n="268">The wholesome counsel rashly I declin'd,</l>
<l n="269">Curious to view the man of monstrous kind,</l>
<l n="270">And try what social rites a savage lends:</l>
<l n="271">Dire rites, alas! and fatal to my friends!</l>
<l n="272">Then first a fire we kindle, and prepare</l>
<l n="273">For his return with sacrifice and prayer.</l>
<l n="274">The loaden shelves afford us full repast;</l>
<l n="275">We sit expecting. Lo! he comes at last.</l>
<l n="276">Near half a forest on his back he bore,</l>
<l n="277">And cast the ponderous burden at the door.</l>
<l n="278">It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then,</l>
<l n="279">And sought the deep recesses of the den.</l>
<l n="280">Now, driven before him through the arching rock,</l>
<l n="281">Came tumbling, heaps on heaps, th' unnumber'd flock:</l>
<l n="282">Big-udder'd ewes, and goats of female kind;</l>
<l n="283">(The males were penn'd in outward courts behind;)</l>
<l n="284">Then, heav'd on high, a rock's enormous weight</l>
<l n="285">To the cave's mouth he roll'd, and clos'd the gate:</l>
<l n="286">(Scarce twenty four-wheel'd cars, compact and strong,</l>
<l n="287">The massy load could bear, or roll along.)</l>
<l n="288">He next betakes him to his evening cares,</l>
<l n="289">And, sitting down, to milk his flocks prepares;</l>
<l n="290">Of half their udders eases first the dams,</l>
<l n="291">Then to the mother's teat submits the lambs.</l>
<l n="292">Half the white stream to hardening cheese he press'd,</l>
<l n="293">And high in wicker-baskets heap'd: the rest,</l>
<l n="294">Reserv'd in bowls, supplied his nightly feast.</l>
<l n="295">His labour done, he fir'd the pile, that gave</l>
<l n="296">A sudden blaze, and lighted all the cave.</l>
<l n="297">We stand discover'd by the rising fires;</l>
<l n="298">Askance the giant glares, and thus inquires:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Polyphemus</speaker>
<l n="299">"What are ye, guests? on what adventure, say,</l>
<l n="300">Thus far ye wander through the watery way?</l>
<l n="301">Pirates perhaps, who seek through seas unknown</l>
<l n="302">The lives of others, and expose your own?"</l>
</sp>
<l n="303">His voice like thunder through the cavern sounds:</l>
<l n="304">My bold companions thrilling fear confounds,</l>
<l n="305">Appall'd at sight of more than mortal man!</l>
<l n="306">At length, with heart recover'd, I began:</l>
<pb n="143"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="307">"From Troy's fam'd fields, sad wanderers o'er the main,</l>
<l n="308">Behold the relics of the Grecian train!</l>
<l n="309">Through various seas, by various perils, toss'd,</l>
<l n="310">And forced by storms, unwilling, on your coast;</l>
<l n="311">Far from our destin'd course and native land,</l>
<l n="312">Such was our fate, and such high Jove's command!</l>
<l n="313">Nor what we are befits us to disclaim,</l>
<l n="314">Atrides' friends, (in arms a mighty name,)</l>
<l n="315">Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow:</l>
<l n="316">Victors of late, but humble suppliants now!</l>
<l n="317">Low at thy knee thy succour we implore;</l>
<l n="318">Respect us, human, and relieve us, poor.</l>
<l n="319">At least, some hospitable gift bestow;</l>
<l n="320">'Tis what the happy to th' unhappy owe:</l>
<l n="321">'Tis what the gods require: those gods revere;</l>
<l n="322">The poor and stranger are their constant care;</l>
<l n="323">To Jove their cause, and their revenge belongs,</l>
<l n="324">He wanders with them, and he feels their wrongs."</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Polyphemus</speaker>
<l n="325">"Fools that ye are," (the savage thus replies,</l>
<l n="326">His inward fury blazing at his eyes,)</l>
<l n="327">"Or strangers, distant far from our abodes,</l>
<l n="328">To bid me reverence or regard the gods.</l>
<l n="329">Know then, we Cyclops are a race above</l>
<l n="330">Those air-bred people, and their goat-nurs'd Jove;</l>
<l n="331">And learn, our power proceeds with thee and thine,</l>
<l n="332">Not as he wills, but as ourselves incline.<ref n="143.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="333">But answer, the good ship that brought ye o'er,</l>
<l n="334">Where lies she anchor'd? near or off the shore?"</l>
</sp>
<l n="335">Thus he. His meditated fraud I find,</l>
<l n="336">(Vers'd in the turns of various human-kind,)</l>
<l n="337">And, cautious, thus: "Against a dreadful rock,</l>
<l n="338">Fast by your shore, the gallant vessel broke.</l>
<l n="339">Scarce with these few I 'scap'd, of all my train:</l>
<l n="340">Whom angry Neptune whelm'd beneath the main:</l>
<l n="341">The scatter'd wreck the winds blew back again."</l>
<l n="342">He answer'd with his deed: his bloody hand</l>
<l n="343">Snatch'd two, unhappy! of my martial band;</l>
<note n="143.1">It is observable that the Cyclops take no notice of the threat, conveyed by Ulysses, of a human avenger in the person of Agamemnon.</note>
<pb n="144"/>
<l n="344">And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor:</l>
<l n="345">The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore.</l>
<l n="346">Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid feast,</l>
<l n="347">And fierce devours it like a mountain beast:</l>
<l n="348">He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains,</l>
<l n="349">Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains.</l>
<l n="350">We see the death from which we cannot move,</l>
<l n="351">And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove.</l>
<l n="352">His ample maw with human carnage fill'd,</l>
<l n="353">A milky deluge next the giant swill'd;</l>
<l n="354">Then, stretch'd in length o'er half the cavern'd rock,</l>
<l n="355">Lay senseless, and supine, amidst the flock.</l>
<l n="356">To seize the time, and with a sudden wound</l>
<l n="357">To fix the slumbering monster to the ground,</l>
<l n="358">My soul impels me! and in act I stand</l>
<l n="359">To draw the sword; but wisdom held my hand.</l>
<l n="360">A deed so rash had finish'd all our fate,</l>
<l n="361">No mortal forces from the lofty gate</l>
<l n="362">Could roll the rock. In hopeless grief we lay,</l>
<l n="363">And sigh, expecting the return of day.</l>
<l n="364">Now did the rosy-finger'd morn arise,</l>
<l n="365">And shed her sacred light along the skies.</l>
<l n="366">He wakes, he lights the fires, he milks the dams,</l>
<l n="367">And to the mothers' teats submits the lambs.</l>
<l n="368">The task thus finish'd of his morning hours,</l>
<l n="369">Two more he snatches, murders and devours.</l>
<l n="370">Then pleas'd, and whistling, drives his flock before,</l>
<l n="371">Removes the rocky mountain from the door,</l>
<l n="372">And shuts again: with equal ease dispos'd</l>
<l n="373">As a light quiver's lid is op'd and clos'd.</l>
<l n="374">His giant voice the echoing region fills:</l>
<l n="375">His flocks, obedient, spread o'er all the hills.</l>
<l n="376">Thus left behind, even in the last despair</l>
<l n="377">I thought, devis'd, and Pallas heard my prayer.</l>
<l n="378">Revenge, and doubt, and caution, work'd my breast;</l>
<l n="379">But this of many counsels seem'd the best:</l>
<l n="380">The monster's club within the cave I spied,</l>
<l n="381">A tree of stateliest growth, and yet undried,</l>
<l n="382">Green from the wood: of height and bulk so vast,</l>
<l n="383">The largest ship might claim it for a mast.</l>
<pb n="145"/>
<l n="384">This shorten'd of its top, I gave my train</l>
<l n="385">A fathom's length, to shape it and to plane:</l>
<l n="386">The narrower end I sharpen'd to a spire;</l>
<l n="387">Whose point we harden'd with the force of fire,</l>
<l n="388">And hid it in the dust that strew'd the cave.</l>
<l n="389">Then to my few companions, bold and brave,</l>
<l n="390">Propos'd, who first the venturous deed should try,</l>
<l n="391">In the broad orbit of his monstrous eye</l>
<l n="392">To plunge the brand, and twirl the pointed wood,</l>
<l n="393">When slumber next should tame the man of blood.</l>
<l n="394">Just as I wish'd, the lots were cast on four:</l>
<l n="395">Myself the fifth. We stand and wait the hour.</l>
<l n="396">He comes with evening: all his fleecy flock</l>
<l n="397">Before him march, and pour into the rock:</l>
<l n="398">Not one, or male or female, stayed behind;</l>
<l n="399">(So fortune chanced, or so some god design'd;)</l>
<l n="400">Then heaving high the stone's unwieldy weight,</l>
<l n="401">He roll'd it on the cave, and clos'd the gate.</l>
<l n="402">First down he sits, to milk the woolly dams,</l>
<l n="403">And then permits their udder to the lambs.</l>
<l n="404">Next seiz'd two wretches more, and headlong cast,</l>
<l n="405">Brain'd on the rock; his second dire repast.</l>
<l n="406">I then approach'd him reeking with their gore,</l>
<l n="407">And held the brimming goblet foaming o'er:</l>
<l n="408">"Cyclop! since human flesh has been thy feast,</l>
<l n="409">Now drain this goblet, potent to digest;</l>
<l n="410">Know hence what treasures in our ship we lost,</l>
<l n="411">And what rich liquors other climates boast.</l>
<l n="412">We to thy shore the precious freight shall bear,</l>
<l n="413">If home thou send us, and vouchsafe to spare.</l>
<l n="414">But oh! thus furious, thirsting thus for gore,</l>
<l n="415">The sons of men shall ne'er approach thy shore,</l>
<l n="416">And never shalt thou taste this nectar more."</l>
<l n="417">He heard, he took, and, pouring down his throat,</l>
<l n="418">Delighted, swill'd the large luxurious draught.</l>
<l n="419">"More! give me more," (he cried) "the boon be thine,</l>
<l n="420">Whoe'er thou art that bear'st celestial wine!</l>
<l n="421">Declare thy name: not mortal is this juice,</l>
<l n="422">Such as th' unbless'd Cyclopean climes produce;</l>
<pb n="146"/>
<l n="423">(Though sure our vine the largest cluster yields,</l>
<l n="424">And Jove's scorn'd thunder serves to drench our fields;)</l>
<l n="425">But this descended from the bless'd abodes,</l>
<l n="426">A rill of nectar, streaming from the gods."</l>
<l n="427">He said, and greedy grasp'd the heady bowl,</l>
<l n="428">Thrice drain'd, and pour'd the deluge on his soul.</l>
<l n="429">His sense lay cover'd with the dozy fume;</l>
<l n="430">While thus my fraudful speech I reassume.</l>
<l n="431">"Thy promised boon, O Cyclop! now I claim,</l>
<l n="432">And plead my title; Noman<ref n="146.1">1</ref> is my name.</l>
<l n="433">By that distinguish'd from my tender years,</l>
<l n="434">'Tis what my parents call me, and my peers."</l>
<l n="435">The giant then: "Our promised grace receive,</l>
<l n="436">The hospitable boon we mean to give:</l>
<l n="437">When all thy wretched crew have felt my power,</l>
<l n="438">Noman shall be the last I will devour."</l>
<l n="439">He said: then, nodding with the fumes of wine,</l>
<l n="440">Dropp'd his huge head, and snoring lay supine.</l>
<l n="441">His neck obliquely o'er his shoulders hung,</l>
<l n="442">Press'd with the weight of sleep, that tames the strong:</l>
<l n="443">There belch'd the mingled streams of wine and blood,</l>
<l n="444">And human flesh, his indigested food.</l>
<l n="445">Sudden I stir the embers, and inspire</l>
<l n="446">With animating breath the seeds of fire;</l>
<l n="447">Each drooping spirit with bold words repair,</l>
<l n="448">And urge my train the dreadful deed to dare:</l>
<l n="449">The stake now glow'd beneath the burning bed</l>
<l n="450">(Green as it was) and sparkled fiery red.</l>
<l n="451">Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring;</l>
<l n="452">With beating hearts my fellows form a ring.</l>
<l n="453">Urged by some present god, they swift let fall</l>
<l n="454">The pointed torment on his visual ball.</l>
<l n="455">Myself above them from a rising ground</l>
<l n="456">Guide the sharp stake, and twirl it round and round.</l>
<l n="457">As when a shipwright stands his workmen o'er,</l>
<l n="458">Who ply the wimble, some huge beam to bore;</l>
<l n="459">Urged on all hands, it nimbly spins about,</l>
<l n="460">The grain deep-piercing till it scoops it out:</l>
<note n="146.1">Answering to the Greek Οὔτις “nobody.”</note>
<pb n="147"/>
<l n="461">In his broad eye so whirls the fiery wood;</l>
<l n="462">From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood;</l>
<l n="463">Singed are his brows; the scorching lids grow black;</l>
<l n="464">The jelly bubbles, and the fibres crack.</l>
<l n="465">And as when armourers temper in the ford</l>
<l n="466">The keen-edg'd pole-axe, or the shining sword,</l>
<l n="467">The red-hot metal hisses in the lake,</l>
<l n="468">Thus in his eye-ball hiss'd the plunging stake.</l>
<l n="469">He sends a dreadful groan, the rocks around</l>
<l n="470">Through all their inmost winding caves resound.</l>
<l n="471">Scar'd we receded. Forth with frantic hand,</l>
<l n="472">He tore, and dash'd on earth the gory brand:</l>
<l n="473">Then calls the Cyclops, all that round him dwell,</l>
<l n="474">With voice like thunder, and a direful yell.</l>
<l n="475">From all their dens the one-ey'd race repair,</l>
<l n="476">From rifted rocks, and mountains bleak in air.</l>
<l n="477">All haste, assembled at his well-known roar,</l>

<l n="496">With hands extended in the midst he sate:</l>
<l n="497">And search'd each passing sheep, and felt it o'er,</l>
<l n="498">Secure to seize us ere we reach'd the door;</l>
<l n="499">(Such as his shallow wit he deem'd was mine;)</l>

<l n="505">Strong were the rams, with native purple fair,</l>
<l n="506">Well fed, and largest of the fleecy care.</l>
<l n="507">These, three and three, with osier bands we tied;</l>
<l n="508">(The twining bands the Cyclop's bed supplied;)</l>
<l n="509">The midmost bore a man, the outward two</l>
<l n="510">Secured each side: so bound we all the crew.</l>
<l n="511">One ram remain'd, the leader of the flock;</l>
<l n="512">In his deep fleece my grasping hands I lock,</l>
<l n="513">And fast beneath, in woolly curls inwove,</l>
<l n="514">There cling implicit, and confide in Jove.</l>
<l n="515">When rosy morning glimmer'd o'er the dales,</l>
<l n="516">He drove to pasture all the lusty males:</l>
<l n="517">The ewes still folded, with distended thighs</l>
<l n="518">Unmilk'd, lay bleating in distressful cries.</l>
<l n="519">But heedless of those cares, with anguish stung,</l>

<l n="523">The master ram at last approach'd the gate,</l>

<l n="559">'Twas on no coward, no ignoble slave,</l>
<l n="560">Thou meditat'dst thy meal in yonder cave;</l>
<l n="561">But one the vengeance fated from above</l>
<l n="562">Doom'd to inflict; the instrument of Jove.</l>
<l n="563">Thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands</l>
<l n="564">The god, the god revenges by my hands."</l>
<l n="565">These words the Cyclop's burning rage provoke;</l>
<l n="566">From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock;</l>
<l n="567">High o'er the billows flew the massy load,</l>
<l n="568">And near the ship came thundering on the flood.</l>
<l n="569">It almost brush'd the helm, and fell before:<ref n="149.2">2</ref></l>
<l n="570">The whole sea shook, and refluent beat the shore.</l>
<l n="571">The strong concussion on the heaving tide</l>
<l n="572">Roll'd back the vessel to the island's side:</l>
<l n="573">Again I shov'd her off; our fate to fly,</l>
<l n="574">Each nerve we stretch, and every oar we ply.</l>
<note n="149.1">It is not clear in what sense this word is here used; whether as signifying rich, fat, plump, or as denoting that which constituted wealth, as cattle did in ancient times.</note>
<note n="149.2">This verse excited some dispute among the ancient critics. Some thought it spurious; others, who thought it genuine, explained it by supposing that Ulysses had turned his ship round while speaking to Polyphemus, so that the rock falling before, that is beyond, the vessel, might come close upon the helm.</note>
<pb n="150"/>
<l n="575">Just 'scaped impending death, when now again</l>
<l n="576">We twice as far had furrow'd back the main,</l>
<l n="577">Once more I raise my voice; my friends, afraid,</l>
<l n="578">With mild entreaties my design dissuade:</l>
<l n="579">"What boots the godless giant to provoke,</l>
<l n="580">Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke?</l>
<l n="581">Already, when the dreadful rock he threw,</l>
<l n="582">Old Ocean shook, and back his surges flew.</l>
<l n="583">The sounding voice directs his aim again;</l>
<l n="584">The rock o'erwhelms us, and we 'scaped in vain."</l>
<l n="585">But I, of mind elate, and scorning fear,</l>
<l n="586">Thus with new taunts insult the monster's ear:</l>
<l n="587">"Cyclop! if any, pitying thy disgrace,</l>
<l n="588">Ask who disfigur'd thus that eyeless face?</l>
<l n="589">Say 'twas Ulysses; 'twas his deed, declare,</l>
<l n="590">Laërtes' son, of Ithaca the fair;</l>
<l n="591">Ulysses, far in fighting fields renown'd,</l>
<l n="592">Before whose arm Troy tumbled to the ground."</l>
<l n="593">Th' astonish'd savage with a roar replies:</l>
<l n="594">"Oh heavens! oh faith of ancient prophecies!</l>
<l n="595">This Telemus Eurymedes foretold:</l>
<l n="596">(The mighty seer who on these hills grew old;</l>
<l n="597">Skill'd the dark fates of mortals to declare,</l>
<l n="598">And learn'd in all wing'd omens of the air;)</l>
<l n="599">Long since he menaced, such was Fate's command;</l>
<l n="600">And nam'd Ulysses as the destin'd hand.</l>
<l n="601">I deem'd some godlike giant to behold,</l>
<l n="602">Or lofty hero, haughty, brave, and bold;</l>
<l n="603">Not this weak pigmy-wretch, of mean design,</l>
<l n="604">Who not by strength subdued me, but by wine.</l>
<l n="605">But come, accept our gifts, and join to pray</l>
<l n="606">Great Neptune's blessing on the watery way;</l>
<l n="607">For his I am, and I the lineage own;</l>
<l n="608">Th' immortal father no less boasts the son.</l>
<l n="609">His power can heal me, and re-light my eye;</l>
<l n="610">And only his, of all the gods on high."</l>
<l n="611">"Oh! could this arm" (I thus aloud rejoin'd)</l>
<l n="612">"From that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind,</l>
<l n="613">And send thee howling to the realms of night,</l>
<l n="614">As sure as Neptune cannot give thee sight!"</l>
<pb n="151"/>
<l n="615">Thus I; while raging he repeats his cries,</l>
<l n="616">With hands uplifted to the starry skies:</l>
<l n="617">"Hear me, O Neptune; thou whose arms are hurl'd</l>
<l n="618">From shore to shore, and gird the solid world.</l>
<l n="619">If thine I am, nor thou my birth disown,</l>
<l n="620">And if th' unhappy Cyclop be thy son,</l>
<l n="621">Let not Ulysses breathe his native air,</l>
<l n="622">Laërtes' son, of Ithaca the fair!</l>
<l n="623">If to review his country be his fate,</l>
<l n="624">Be it through toils and sufferings, long and late;</l>
<l n="625">His lost companions let him first deplore;</l>
<l n="626">Some vessel, not his own, transport him o'er;</l>
<l n="627">And when at home from foreign sufferings freed,</l>
<l n="628">More near and deep, domestic woes succeed!"</l>
<l n="629">With imprecations thus he fill'd the air,</l>
<l n="630">And angry Neptune heard th' unrighteous prayer.</l>
<l n="631">A larger rock then heaving from the plain,</l>
<l n="632">He whirl'd it round; it sung across the main;</l>
<l n="633">It fell, and brush'd the stern: the billows roar,</l>
<l n="634">Shake at the weight, and refluent beat the shore.</l>
<l n="635">With all our force we kept aloof to sea,</l>
<l n="636">And gain'd the island where our vessels lay.</l>
<l n="637">Our sight the whole collected navy cheer'd,</l>
<l n="638">Who, waiting long, by turns had hop'd and fear'd.</l>
<l n="639">There, disembarking on the green sea side,</l>

<l n="645">But the great god, whose thunder rends the skies,</l>

<l n="647">And sees me wandering still from coast to coast:</l>

<head>THE TENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY.</head>
<argument>
<p>ADVENTURES WITH ÆOLUS, THE LÆSTRYGONS, AND CIRCE.</p>
<p>Ulysses arrives at the island of Æolus, who gives him prosperous winds, and incloses the adverse ones in a bag, which his companions untying, they are driven back again, and rejected. Then they sail to the Læstrygons, where they lose eleven ships, and, with one only remaining, proceed to the island of Circe. Eurylochus is sent first with some companions, all which, except Eurylochus, are transformed into swine. Ulysses then undertakes the adventure, and by the help of Mercury, who gives him the herb Moly, overcomes the enchantress, and procures the restoration of his men. After a year's stay with her, he prepares, at her instigation, for his voyage to the infernal shades.</p>

<l n="1">"AT length we reach'd Æolia's sea-girt shore,</l>
<l n="2">Where great Hippotades<ref n="152.1">1</ref> the sceptre bore,</l>
<l n="3">A floating isle !<ref n="152.2">2</ref> High rais'd by toil divine,</l>
<l n="4">Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine.</l>
<l n="5">Six blooming youths, in private grandeur bred,</l>

<l n="7">These sons their sisters wed, and all remain</l>
<l n="8">Their parents' pride, and pleasure of their reign.</l>
<l n="9">All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round,</l>
<l n="10">And joy and music through the isle resound:</l>
<l n="11">At night each pair on splendid carpets lay,</l>
<l n="12">And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day.</l>
<note n="152.1">A name of Æolus.</note>

<pb n="153"/>
<l n="13">This happy port affords our wandering fleet</l>
<l n="14">A month's reception, and a safe retreat.</l>
<l n="15">Full oft the monarch urged me to relate</l>
<l n="16">The fall of Ilion, and the Grecian fate;</l>
<l n="17">Full oft I told; at length for parting mov'd;</l>
<l n="18">The king with mighty gifts my suit approv'd.</l>
<l n="19">The adverse winds in leathern bags he braced,</l>
<l n="20">Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast:</l>
<l n="21">For him the mighty sire of gods assign'd</l>
<l n="22">The tempest's lord, the tyrant of the wind:</l>
<l n="23">His word alone the listening storms obey,</l>
<l n="24">To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.</l>
<l n="25">These in my hollow ship the monarch hung,</l>
<l n="26">Securely fetter'd by a silver thong:</l>
<l n="27">But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales</l>
<l n="28">He charged to fill and guide the swelling sails:</l>
<l n="29">Rare gift! but O, what gift to fools avails?</l>
<l n="30">Nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar;</l>
<l n="31">The tenth presents our welcome native shore:</l>
<l n="32">The hills display the beacon's friendly light,</l>
<l n="33">And rising mountains gain upon our sight.</l>
<l n="34">Then first my eyes, by watchful toils oppress'd,</l>
<l n="35">Complied to take the balmy gifts of rest:</l>
<l n="36">Then first my hands did from the rudder part,</l>
<l n="37">(So much the love of home possess'd my heart:)</l>
<l n="38">When lo! on board a fond debate arose,</l>
<l n="39">What rare device those vessels might inclose?</l>
<l n="40">What sum, what prize from Æolus I brought?</l>
<l n="41">Whilst to his neighbour each express'd his thought:</l>
<l n="42">'Say, whence, ye gods, contending nations strive</l>
<l n="43">Who most shall please, who most our hero give?</l>
<l n="44">Long have his coffers groan'd with Trojan spoils;</l>
<l n="45">Whilst we, the wretched partners of his toils,</l>
<l n="46">Reproach'd by want, our fruitless labours mourn,</l>
<l n="47">And only rich in barren fame return.</l>
<l n="48">Now Æolus, ye see, augments his store:</l>
<l n="49">But come, my friends, these mystic gifts explore.'</l>
<l n="50">They said: and (oh curs'd fate!) the thongs unbound!</l>
<l n="51">The gushing tempest sweeps the ocean round;</l>
<pb n="154"/>
<l n="52">Snatch'd in the whirl, the hurried navy flew,</l>
<l n="53">The ocean widen'd, and the shores withdrew.</l>
<l n="54">Rous'd from my fatal sleep, I long debate</l>
<l n="55">If still to live, or desperate plunge to fate;</l>
<l n="56">Thus doubting, prostrate on the deck I lay,</l>
<l n="57">Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way.</l>
<l n="58">Meanwhile our vessels plough the liquid plain,</l>
<l n="59">And soon the known Æolian coast regain;</l>
<l n="60">Our groans the rocks remurmur'd to the main.</l>
<l n="61">We leap'd on shore, and with a scanty feast</l>
<l n="62">Our thirst and hunger hastily repress'd;</l>
<l n="63">That done, two chosen heralds straight attend</l>
<l n="64">Our second progress to my royal friend:</l>
<l n="65">And him amidst his jovial sons we found;</l>
<l n="66">The banquet steaming, and the goblets crown'd:</l>
<l n="67">There humbly stopp'd with conscious shame and awe,</l>
<l n="68">Nor nearer than the gate presum'd to draw.</l>
<l n="69">But soon his sons their well-known guest descried,</l>
<l n="70">And, starting from their couches, loudly cried,</l>
<l n="71">'Ulysses here! what dæmon couldst thou meet</l>
<l n="72">To thwart thy passage, and repel thy fleet?</l>
<l n="73">Wast thou not furnish'd by our choicest care</l>
<l n="74">For Greece, for home, and all thy soul held dear?'</l>
<l n="75">Thus they; in silence long my fate I mourn'd,</l>
<l n="76">At length these words with accent low return'd:</l>
<l n="77">'Me, lock'd in sleep, my faithless crew bereft</l>
<l n="78">Of all the blessings of your godlike gift!</l>
<l n="79">But grant, oh grant our loss we may retrieve;</l>
<l n="80">A favour you, and you alone can give.'</l>
<l n="81">Thus I with art to move their pity tried,</l>
<l n="82">And touch'd the youths; but their stern sire replied:</l>
<l n="83">"Vile wretch, begone! this instant I command</l>
<l n="84">Thy fleet accurs'd to leave our hallow'd land.</l>
<l n="85">His baneful suit pollutes these bless'd abodes,</l>
<l n="86">Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the gods."</l>
<l n="87">Thus fierce he said: we sighing went our way,</l>
<l n="88">And with desponding hearts put off to sea.</l>
<l n="89">The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn,</l>
<l n="90">But mourn in vain; no prospect of return.</l>
<pb n="155"/>
<l n="91">Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer;</l>
<l n="92">The next proud Lamos'<ref n="155.1">1</ref> stately towers appear,</l>
<l n="93">And Læstrygonia's gates arise distinct in air.</l>
<l n="94">The shepherd, quitting here at night the plain,</l>
<l n="95">Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain;<ref n="155.2">2</ref></l>
<l n="96">But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear,</l>
<l n="97">And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care,</l>
<l n="98">So near the pastures, and so short the way,</l>
<l n="99">His double toils may claim a double pay,</l>
<l n="100">And join the labours of the night and day.</l>
<l n="101">Within a long recess a bay there lies,</l>
<l n="102">Edged round with cliffs high pointing to the skies;</l>
<l n="103">The jutting shores that swell on either side</l>
<l n="104">Contract its mouth, and break the rushing tide.</l>
<l n="105">Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat,</l>
<l n="106">And bound within the port their crowded fleet;</l>
<l n="107">For here retir'd the sinking billows sleep,</l>
<l n="108">And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep.</l>
<l n="109">I only in the bay refus'd to moor,</l>
<l n="110">And fix'd, without, my halsers to the shore.</l>
<l n="111">From thence we climb'd a point, whose airy brow</l>
<l n="112">Commands the prospect of the plains below:</l>
<l n="113">No tracks of beasts, or signs of men, we found,</l>
<l n="114">But smoky volumes<ref n="155.3">3</ref> rolling from the ground.</l>
<l n="115">Two with our herald thither we command,</l>
<l n="116">With speed to learn what men possess'd the land.</l>
<l n="117">They went, and kept the wheel's smooth beaten road</l>
<l n="118">Which to the city drew the mountain wood;</l>
<l n="119">When lo! they met, beside a crystal spring,</l>
<l n="120">The daughter of Antiphates the king;</l>
<l n="121">She to Artacia's silver streams came down,</l>
<l n="122">(Artacia's streams alone supply the town ;)</l>
<l n="123">The damsel they approach, and ask'd what race</l>
<l n="124">The people were? who monarch of the place?</l>
<l n="125">With joy the maid th' unwary strangers heard,</l>
<l n="126">And show'd them where the royal dome appear'd.</l>
<note n="155.1">The name of an old king of Læstrygonia, a country on the east coast of Sicily, near Leontium.</note>
<note n="155.2">He that could live without sleep, might gain double hire, tending sheep by day, and oxen by night.</note>
<note n="155.3">This means nothing more than the smoke ascending from the houses.</note>
<pb n="156"/>
<l n="127">They went; but, as they entering saw the queen</l>
<l n="128">Of size enormous, and terrific mien,</l>
<l n="129">(Not yielding to some bulky mountain's height,)</l>
<l n="130">A sudden horror struck their aching sight.</l>
<l n="131">Swift at her call her husband scour'd away</l>
<l n="132">To wreak his hunger on the destin'd prey;</l>
<l n="133">One for his food the raging glutton slew,</l>
<l n="134">But two rush'd out, and to the navy flew.</l>
<l n="135">Balk'd of his prey, the yelling monster flies,</l>
<l n="136">And fills the city with his hideous cries:</l>
<l n="137">A ghastly band of giants hear the roar,</l>
<l n="138">And, pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore.</l>
<l n="139">Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow,</l>
<l n="140">And dash the ruins on the ships below:</l>
<l n="141">The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise,</l>
<l n="142">And mingled horrors echo to the skies:</l>
<l n="143">The men, like fish, they stuck upon the flood,</l>
<l n="144">And cramm'd their filthy throats with human food.</l>
<l n="145">Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay,</l>
<l n="146">My sword our cables cut, I call'd to weigh;</l>
<l n="147">And charged my men, as they from fate would fly,</l>
<l n="148">Each nerve to strain, each bending oar to ply.</l>
<l n="149">The sailors catch the word, their oars they seize,</l>
<l n="150">And sweep with equal strokes the smoky seas:</l>
<l n="151">Clear of the rocks the impatient vessel flies;</l>
<l n="152">Whilst in the port each wretch encumber'd dies.</l>
<l n="153">With earnest haste my frighted sailors press,</l>
<l n="154">While kindling transports glow'd at our success;</l>
<l n="155">But the sad fate that did our friends destroy,</l>
<l n="156">Cool'd every breast, and damp'd the rising joy.</l>
<l n="157">Now dropp'd our anchors in the Ææan bay,<ref n="156.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="158">Where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the Day!</l>

<l n="165">Some god directing, to this peaceful bay</l>

<l n="167">Spent and o'erwatch'd. Two days and nights roll'd on,</l>
<l n="168">And now the third succeeding morning shone.</l>
<l n="169">I climb'd a cliff, with spear and sword in hand,</l>
<l n="170">Whose ridge o'erlook'd a shady length of land;</l>
<l n="171">To learn if aught of mortal works appear,</l>
<l n="172">Or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear?</l>
<l n="173">From the high point I mark'd, in distant view,</l>
<l n="174">A stream of curling smoke ascending blue,</l>

<l n="177">Thither to haste, the region to explore,</l>

<l n="179">I deem'd it best to visit first my crew,</l>
<l n="180">And send out spies the dubious coast to view.</l>
<l n="181">As down the hill I solitary go,</l>
<l n="182">Some power divine, who pities human woe,</l>
<l n="183">Sent a tall stag, descending from the wood,</l>
<l n="184">To cool his fervour in the crystal flood;</l>
<l n="185">Luxuriant on the wave-worn bank he lay,</l>
<l n="186">Stretch'd forth and panting in the sunny ray.</l>
<l n="187">I launch'd my spear, and with a sudden wound</l>
<l n="188">Transpierced his back, and fix'd him to the ground.</l>
<l n="189">He falls, and mourns his fate with human cries:</l>
<l n="190">Through the wide wound the vital spirit flies.</l>
<l n="191">I drew, and casting on the river's side</l>
<l n="192">The bloody spear, his gather'd feet I tied</l>
<l n="193">With twining osiers which the bank supplied.</l>
<l n="194">An ell in length the pliant wisp I weav'd,</l>
<l n="195">And the huge body on my shoulders heav'd:</l>
<l n="196">Then, leaning on my spear with both my hands,</l>
<l n="197">Upbore my load, and press'd the sinking sands</l>
<l n="198">With weighty steps, till at the ship I threw</l>
<l n="199">The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew:</l>
<l n="200">"Cheer up, my friends! it is not yet our fate</l>

<l n="204">The joyful crew survey his mighty size,</l>
<l n="205">And on the future banquet feast their eyes,</l>
<l n="206">As huge in length extended lay the beast;</l>
<l n="207">Then wash their hands, and hasten to the feast.</l>
<l n="208">There, till the setting sun roll'd down the light,</l>
<l n="209">They sate indulging in the genial rite.</l>
<l n="210">When evening rose, and darkness cover'd o'er</l>
<l n="211">The face of things, we slept along the shore.</l>
<l n="212">But when the rosy morning warm'd the east,</l>
<l n="213">My men I summon'd, and these words address'd:</l>

<l n="225">Some smoke I saw amidst the forest rise,</l>
<l n="226">And all around it only seas and skies!"</l>
<l n="227">With broken hearts my sad companions stood,</l>
<l n="228">Mindful of Cyclops and his human food,</l>
<l n="229">And horrid Læstrygons, the men of blood.</l>
<l n="230">Presaging tears apace began to rain:</l>
<l n="231">But tears in mortal miseries are vain.</l>
<l n="232">In equal parts I straight divide my band,</l>
<l n="233">And name a chief each party to command;</l>
<l n="234">I led the one, and of the other side</l>
<l n="235">Appointed brave Eurylochus the guide.</l>
<l n="236">Then in the brazen helm the lots we throw,</l>
<l n="237">And fortune casts Eurylochus to go:</l>
<l n="238">He march'd with twice eleven in his train;<ref n="158.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="239">Pensive they march, and pensive we remain.</l>
<note n="158.1">Ulysses divides his men into two bodies; each contains two-and-twenty men. This is agreeable, observes Eustathius, to the former account of Homer; each vessel carried fifty men, six out of every one were destroyed by the Ciconians, and therefore forty-four is the exact number inclusive of himself and the surviving company.

<l n="240">The palace in a woody vale they found,</l>
<l n="241">High raised of stone; a shaded space around;</l>
<l n="242">Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam,</l>
<l n="243">(By magic tamed,) familiar to the dome.</l>
<l n="244">With gentle blandishment our men they meet,</l>
<l n="245">And wag their tails, and fawning lick their feet.</l>
<l n="246">As from some feast a man returning late,</l>
<l n="247">His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate,</l>
<l n="248">Rejoicing round, some morsel to receive,</l>
<l n="249">(Such as the good man ever used to give,)</l>
<l n="250">Domestic thus the grisly beasts drew near;</l>
<l n="251">They gaze with wonder not unmix'd with fear.</l>
<l n="252">Now on the threshold of the dome they stood,</l>
<l n="253">And heard a voice resounding through the wood:</l>
<l n="254">Placed at her loom within, the goddess sung;</l>
<l n="255">The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung.</l>
<l n="256">O'er the fair web the rising figures shine,</l>
<l n="257">Immortal labour! worthy hands divine.</l>
<l n="258">Polites to the rest the question mov'd,</l>
<l n="259">(A gallant leader, and a man I lov'd:)</l>
<l n="260">"What voice celestial, chanting to the loom,</l>
<l n="261">(Or nymph, or goddess,) echoes from the room?</l>
<l n="262">Say, shall we seek access?' With that they call;</l>
<l n="263">And wide unfold the portals of the hall.</l>
<l n="264">The goddess, rising, asks her guests to stay,</l>
<l n="265">Who blindly follow where she leads the way.</l>
<l n="266">Eurylochus alone of all the band,</l>
<l n="267">Suspecting fraud, more prudently remain'd.</l>
<l n="268">On thrones around with downy coverings graced,</l>
<l n="269">With semblance fair, th' unhappy men she placed.</l>
<l n="270">Milk newly press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,</l>
<l n="271">And honey fresh, and Pramnian wines<ref n="159.1">1</ref> the treat:</l>
<l n="272">But venom'd was the bread, and mix'd the bowl,</l>
<l n="273">With drugs of force to darken all the soul:</l>
<note n="159.1">The product of an excellent species of vine, which probably was so called from having been first found in Pramnus, a place in the island of Icarus or Icaria, one of the Sperades in the Ægean sea.</note>
<pb n="160"/>
<l n="274">Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost,</l>
<l n="275">And drank oblivion of their native coast.</l>
<l n="276">Instant her circling wand the goddess waves,</l>
<l n="277">To hogs transforms them, and the sty receives.</l>
<l n="278">No more was seen the human form divine;</l>
<l n="279">Head, face, and members, bristle into swine:</l>
<l n="280">Still curs'd with sense, their minds remain alone,</l>
<l n="281">And their own voice affrights them when they groan.</l>
<l n="282">Meanwhile the goddess in disdain bestows</l>
<l n="283">The mast and acorn, brutal food! and strows</l>
<l n="284">The fruits and cornel, as their feast, around;</l>
<l n="285">Now prone and grovelling on unsavoury ground.</l>
<l n="286">Eurylochus, with pensive steps and slow,</l>
<l n="287">Aghast returns; the messenger of woe,</l>
<l n="288">And bitter fate. To speak he made essay;</l>
<l n="289">In vain essay'd, nor would his tongue obey.</l>
<l n="290">His swelling heart denied the words their way:</l>
<l n="291">But speaking tears the want of words supply,</l>
<l n="292">And the full soul burst copious from his eye.</l>
<l n="293">Affrighted, anxious for our fellows' fates,</l>
<l n="294">We press to hear what sadly he relates:</l>
<l n="295">"We went, Ulysses! (such was thy command,)</l>
<l n="296">Through the lone thicket and the desert land.</l>
<l n="297">A palace in a woody vale we found,</l>
<l n="298">Brown with dark forests, and with shades around.</l>
<l n="299">A voice celestial echoed through the dome,</l>
<l n="300">Or nymph or goddess, chanting to the loom.</l>
<l n="301">Access we sought, nor was access denied:</l>
<l n="302">Radiant she came; the portals open'd wide:</l>
<l n="303">The goddess mild invites the guests to stay:</l>
<l n="304">They blindly follow where she leads the way.</l>
<l n="305">I only wait behind of all the train:</l>
<l n="306">I waited long, and ey'd the doors in vain:</l>
<l n="307">The rest are vanish'd, none repass'd the gate;</l>
<l n="308">And not a man appears to tell their fate."</l>
<l n="309">I heard, and instant o'er my shoulder flung</l>
<l n="310">The belt in which my weighty faulchion hung,</l>
<l n="311">(A beamy blade:) then seiz'd the bended bow,</l>
<l n="312">And bade him guide the way, resolv'd to go.</l>
<pb n="161"/>
<l n="313">He, prostrate falling, with both hands embrac'd</l>
<l n="314">My knees, and weeping thus his suit address'd:</l>
<l n="315">"O king, belov'd of Jove, thy servant spare,</l>
<l n="316">And ah, thyself the rash attempt forbear!</l>
<l n="317">Never, alas! thou never shalt return,</l>
<l n="318">Or see the wretched, for whose loss we mourn.</l>
<l n="319">With what remains from certain ruin fly,</l>
<l n="320">And save the few not fated yet to die."</l>
<l n="321">I answer'd stern: "Inglorious then remain,</l>
<l n="322">Here feast and loiter, and desert thy train.</l>
<l n="323">Alone, unfriended, will I tempt my way;</l>
<l n="324">The laws of fate compel, and I obey."</l>
<l n="325">This said, and scornful turning from the shore</l>
<l n="326">My haughty step, I stalk'd the valley o'er.</l>
<l n="327">Till now, approaching nigh the magic bower,</l>
<l n="328">Where dwelt th' enchantress skill'd in herbs of power,</l>
<l n="329">A form divine forth issued from the wood,</l>
<l n="330">(Immortal Hermes with the golden rod,)</l>
<l n="331">In human semblance. On his bloomy face</l>
<l n="332">Youth smiled celestial, with each opening grace.</l>
<l n="333">He seiz'd my hand, and gracious thus began:</l>
<l n="334">"Ah whither roam'st thou, much-enduring man?</l>
<l n="335">O blind to fate! what led thy steps to rove</l>
<l n="336">The horrid mazes of this magic grove?</l>
<l n="337">Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies,</l>
<l n="338">All lost their form, and habitants of sties.</l>
<l n="339">Think'st thou by wit to model their escape?</l>
<l n="340">Sooner shalt thou, a stranger to thy shape,</l>
<l n="341">Fall prone their equal: first thy danger know,</l>
<l n="342">Then take the antidote the gods bestow.</l>
<l n="343">The plant I give through all the direful bower</l>
<l n="344">Shall guard thee, and avert the evil hour.</l>
<l n="345">Now hear her wicked arts. Before thy eyes</l>
<l n="346">The bowl shall sparkle, and the banquet rise;</l>
<l n="347">Take this, nor from the faithless feast abstain,</l>
<l n="348">For temper'd drugs and poison shall be vain.</l>
<l n="349">Soon as she strikes her wand, and gives the word,</l>
<l n="350">Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword,</l>
<l n="351">And menace death: those menaces shall move</l>
<l n="352">Her alter'd mind to blandishment and love.</l>
<pb n="162"/>
<l n="353">Nor shun the blessing proffer'd to thy arms.</l>
<l n="354">Ascend her bed, and taste celestial charms:</l>
<l n="355">So shall thy tedious toils a respite find,</l>
<l n="356">And thy lost friends return to human-kind.</l>
<l n="357">But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie</l>
<l n="358">The powers below, the blessed in the sky;</l>
<l n="359">Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant,</l>
<l n="360">Or magic bind thee cold and impotent."</l>
<l n="361">Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew,</l>
<l n="362">Where on th' all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew,</l>
<l n="363">And show'd its nature and its wondrous power:</l>
<l n="364">Black was the root, but milky white the flower;</l>
<l n="365">Moly! the name, to mortals hard to find,<ref n="162.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="366">But all is easy to th' ethereal kind.</l>
<l n="367">This Hermes gave, then, gliding off the glade,</l>
<l n="368">Shot to Olympus from the woodland shade.</l>
<l n="369">While, full of thought, revolving fates to come,</l>
<l n="370">I speed my passage to th' enchanted dome.</l>
<l n="371">Arriv'd, before the lofty gates I stay'd;</l>
<l n="372">The lofty gates the goddess wide display'd:</l>
<l n="373">She leads before, and to the feast invites;</l>
<l n="374">I follow sadly to the magic rites.</l>
<l n="375">Radiant with starry studs, a silver seat</l>
<l n="376">Receiv'd my limbs: a footstool eas'd my feet.</l>
<l n="377">She mix'd the potion, fraudulent of soul;</l>
<l n="378">The poison mantled in the golden bowl.</l>
<l n="379">I took, and quaff'd it, confident in heaven:</l>
<l n="380">Then wav'd the wand, and then the word was given.</l>
<l n="381">"Hence to thy fellows!" (dreadful she began,)</l>
<l n="382">"Go, be a beast!"—I heard, and yet was man.</l>
<l n="383">Then sudden whirling, like a waving flame,</l>
<l n="384">My beamy faulchion, I assault the dame.</l>
<l n="385">Struck with unusual fear, she trembling cries,</l>
<l n="386">She faints, she falls; she lifts her weeping eyes.</l>
<l n="387">"What art thou? say! from whence, from whom you came?</l>
<l n="388">O more than human! tell thy race, thy name.</l>
<l n="389">Amazing strength, these poisons to sustain!</l>
<l n="390">Not mortal thou, nor mortal is thy brain.<ref n="162.1">1</ref></l>

<l n="399">"And how, dread Circe!" (furious I rejoin)</l>
<l n="400">"Can love, and love-born confidence, be mine,</l>
<l n="401">Beneath thy charms when my companions groan,</l>
<l n="402">Transform'd to beasts, with accents not their own?</l>
<l n="403">O thou of fraudful heart, shall I be led</l>

<l n="411">The goddess swore: then seiz'd my hand and led</l>

<l n="413">Ministrant to the queen, with busy care</l>
<l n="414">Four faithful handmaids the soft rites prepare;</l>

<l n="429">A vest and tunic o'er me next she threw,</l>
<l n="430">Fresh from the bath, and dropping balmy dew;</l>
<l n="431">Then led and placed me on the sovereign seat,</l>
<l n="432">With carpets spread; a footstool at my feet.</l>

<l n="445">"Why sits Ulysses silent and apart,</l>
<l n="446">Some hoard of grief close harbour'd at his heart?</l>
<l n="447">Untouch'd before thee stand the cates divine,</l>

<l n="449">Can yet a doubt or any dread remain,</l>
<l n="450">When sworn that oath which never can be vain?"</l>
<l n="451">I answered: "Goddess! human is my breast,</l>

<l n="453">Ill fits it me, whose friends are sunk to beasts,</l>
<l n="454">To quaff thy bowls, or riot in thy feasts.</l>
<l n="455">Me would'st thou please? for them thy cares employ,</l>
<l n="456">And them to me restore, and me to joy."</l>
<l n="457">With that she parted: in her potent hand</l>
<l n="458">She bore the virtue of the magic wand.</l>
<l n="459">Then, hastening to the sties, set wide the door,</l>
<l n="460">Urged forth, and drove the bristly herd before;</l>
<l n="461">Unwieldy, out they rush'd with general cry,</l>
<l n="462">Enormous beasts dishonest to the eye.</l>
<l n="463">Now, touch'd by counter-charms, they change again,</l>
<l n="464">And stand majestic, and recall'd to men.</l>
<l n="465">Those hairs of late that bristled every part,</l>

<note n="164.1">Homer excellently carries on his allegory: he intends by this expression of the enlargement of the beauty of Ulysses's companions, to teach that men who turn from an evil course, into the paths of virtue, excel even themselves; having learned the value of virtue from the miseries they suffered in pursuit of vice, they become new men, and, as it were, enjoy a second life.

Circe declares to Ulysses the necessity of consulting Tiresias, that he may learn from the mouth of that prophet, that his death was to be from the ocean; she acts thus in order to dispose him to stay with her, after his return from the regions of the dead. By the descent of Ulysses into hell may be signified, that a wise man ought to be ignorant of nothing; that he ought to ascend in thought into heaven, and understand the heavenly appearances, and be acquainted with what is contained in the bowels of the earth, and bring to light the secrets of nature. Pope. As to his death being from the ocean, see note on B. xi. 167.</note>

<head>THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY.</head>
<argument>
<p>THE DESCENT INTO HELL.</p>
<p>Ulysses continues his narration. How he arrived at the land of the Cimmerians, and what ceremonies he performed to invoke the dead. The manner of his descent, and the apparition of the shades: his conversation with Elpenor, and with Tiresias, who informs him in a prophetic manner of his fortunes to come. He meets his mother Anticlea, from whom he learns the state of his family. He sees the shades of the ancient heroines, afterwards of the heroes, and converses in particular with Agamemnon and Achilles. Ajax keeps at a sullen distance, and disdains to answer him. He then beholds Tityus, Tantalus, Sisyphus, Hercules; till he is deterred from further curiosity by the apparition of horrid spectres, and the cries of the wicked in torments.</p>

<l n="25">The victims, vow'd to each Tartarean power,</l>
<l n="26">Eurylochus and Perimedes bore.</l>

<l n="30">A cavern form'd, a cubit long and wide.</l>
<l n="31">New wine, with honey-temper'd milk, we bring,</l>
<l n="32">Then living waters from the crystal spring:</l>
<l n="33">O'er these was strew'd the consecrated flour,</l>
<l n="34">And on the surface shone the holy store.</l>
<l n="35">Now the wan shades we hail, th' infernal gods,</l>
<l n="36">To speed our course, and waft us o'er the floods:</l>
<l n="37">So shall a barren heifer from the stall</l>
<l n="38">Beneath the knife upon your altars fall;</l>
<l n="39">So in our palace, at our safe return,</l>

<note n="176.1">The common account of the death of Ulysses, is, that he died of a wound received in a conflict with Telegonus, his son by Circe, who, sailing to Ithaca in search of his father, and landing on the coast, seized some sheep for the use of his crew, when, as the shepherds defended their flocks, Ulysses and Telemachus came to the support of the shepherds, and Telegonus, not knowing that Ulysses was his father, pierced him with a spear pointed with the bone of a sea-turtle: so that the sea, or Neptune, may be said to have pointed the fatal weapon. "Eustathius tells us the reason of this command given to Ulysses to search out a people ignorant of the sea: it was in honour of Neptune, to make his name regarded by a nation which was entirely a stranger to that deity; and this injunction was laid by way of atonement for the violence offered to his son Polyphemus."

<p>He relates how, after his return from the shades, he was sent by Circe on
his voyage, by the coast of the Sirens, and by the strait of Scylla and
Charybdis: the manner in which he escaped those dangers: how, being
cast on the island Trinacria, his companions destroyed the oxen of the
Sun; the vengeance that followed; how all perished by shipwreck ex-
cept himself, who, swimming on the mast of the ship, arrived on the

<p>THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.</p>
<p>Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinoüs and Arete, and embarks in the evening.
Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca; where the sailors, as Ulysses
is yet sleeping, lay him on the shore with all his treasures. On their re-
turn, Neptune changes their ship into a rock. In the mean time, Ulysses
awaking, knows not his native Ithaca, by reason of a mist which Pallas
had cast round him. He breaks into loud lamentations; till the god-
dess appearing to him in the form of a shepherd, discovers the country
to him, and points out the particular places. He then tells a feigned
story of his adventures, upon which she manifests herself, and they
consult together on the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors.
To conceal his return, and disguise his person the more effectually, she
changes him into the figure of an old beggar.</p>
</argument>
<l n="1">HE ceas'd; but left so pleasing on their ear</l>
<l n="2">His voice, that listening still they seem'd to hear.</l>
<l n="3">A pause of silence hush'd the shady rooms:</l>
<l n="4">The grateful conference then the king resumes:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Alcinoüs</speaker>
<l n="5">'Whatever toils the great Ulysses pass'd,</l>
<l n="6">'Beneath this happy roof they end at last;</l>
<l n="7">'No longer now from shore to shore to roam,</l>
<l n="8">'Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home.</l>
<l n="9">'But hear me, princes! whom these walls enclose,</l>
<l n="10">'For whom my chanter sings, and goblet flows</l>
<l n="11">'With wine unmix'd (an honour due to age,</l>
<l n="12">'To cheer the grave, and warm the poet's rage,)</l>
<l n="13">'Though labour'd gold, and many a dazzling vest</l>
<l n="14">'Lie heap'd already for our godlike guest:</l>
<l n="15">'Without new treasures let him not remove,</l>
<l n="16">'Large, and expressive of the public love:</l>
<l n="17">'Each peer a tripod, each a vase bestow,</l>
<l n="18">'A general tribute, which the state shall owe.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="19">This sentence pleas'd: then all their steps address'd</l>
<l n="20">To separate mansions, and retired to rest.</l>
<l n="21">Now did the rosy-finger'd morn arise,</l>
<l n="22">And shed her sacred light along the skies.</l>
<l n="23">Down to the haven and the ships in haste</l>
<l n="24">They bore the treasures, and in safety plac'd.</l>
<l n="25">The king himself the vases ranged with care;</l>
<l n="26">Then bade his followers to the feast repair.</l>
<l n="27">A victim ox beneath the sacred hand</l>
<l n="28">Of great Alcinoüs falls, and stains the sand.</l>
<l n="29">To Jove th' Eternal, (power above all powers!</l>
<l n="30">Who wings the winds, and darkens heaven with showers,)</l>
<l n="31">The flames ascend: till evening they prolong</l>
<l n="32">The rites, more sacred made by heavenly song:</l>
<l n="33">For in the midst, with public honours graced,</l>
<l n="34">Thy lyre, divine Demodocus! was placed.</l>
<l n="35">All, but Ulysses, heard with fix'd delight:</l>
<l n="36">He sate, and ey'd the sun, and wish'd the night:</l>
<l n="37">Slow seem'd the sun to move, the hours to roll,</l>
<l n="38">His native home deep-imaged in his soul.</l>
<l n="39">As the tir'd ploughman spent with stubborn toil,</l>
<l n="40">Whose oxen long have torn the furrow'd soil,</l>
<l n="41">Sees with delight the sun's declining ray,</l>
<l n="42">When home with feeble knees he bends his way</l>
<pb n="209"/>
<l n="43">To late repast, (the day's hard labour done,)</l>
<l n="44">So to Ulysses welcome set the sun;</l>
<l n="45">Then instant to Alcinoüs and the rest</l>
<l n="46">(The Scherian<ref n="209.1">1</ref> states) he turn'd, and thus address'd:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="47">'O thou, the first in merit and command!</l>
<l n="48">'And you the peers and princes of the land!</l>
<l n="49">'May every joy be yours! nor this the least,</l>
<l n="50">'When due libation shall have crown'd the feast,</l>
<l n="51">'Safe to my home to send your happy guest.</l>
<l n="52">'Complete are now the bounties you have given,</l>
<l n="53">'Be all those bounties but confirm'd by Heaven!</l>
<l n="54">'So may I find, when all my wanderings cease,</l>
<l n="55">'My consort blameless, and my friends in peace.</l>
<l n="56">'On you be every bliss; and every day,</l>
<l n="57">'In home-felt joys, delighted roll away:</l>
<l n="58">'Yourselves, your wives, your long-descending race,</l>
<l n="59">'May every god enrich with every grace!</l>
<l n="60">'Sure fix'd on virtue may your nation stand,</l>
<l n="61">'And public evil never touch the land!'</l>
</sp>
<l n="62">His words well weigh'd, the general voice approv'd</l>
<l n="63">Benign, and instant his dismission mov'd.</l>
<l n="64">The monarch to Pontonoüs gave the sign,</l>
<l n="65">To fill the goblet high with rosy wine:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Alcinoüs</speaker>
<l n="66">'Great Jove the Father first' (he cried) 'implore;</l>
<l n="67">'Then send the stranger to his native shore.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="68">The luscious wine th' obedient herald brought;</l>
<l n="69">Around the mansion flow'd the purple draught;</l>
<l n="70">Each from his seat to each immortal pours,</l>
<l n="71">Whom glory circles in the Olympian bowers.</l>
<l n="72">Ulysses sole with air majestic stands,</l>
<l n="73">The bowl presenting to Aretè's hands;</l>
<l n="74">Then thus: 'O queen, farewell! be still possess'd</l>
<l n="75">'Of dear remembrance, blessing still and bless'd!</l>
<l n="76">'Till age and death shall gently call thee hence,</l>

<l n="82">Sent by Alcinoüs; of Aretè's train</l>
<l n="83">Three chosen maids attend him to the main:</l>
<l n="84">This does a tunic and white vest convey,</l>
<l n="85">A various casket that, of rich inlay,</l>
<l n="86">And bread and wine the third. The cheerful mates</l>
<l n="87">Safe in the hollow poop dispose the cates:</l>
<l n="88">Upon the deck soft painted robes they spread,</l>
<l n="89">With linen cover'd, for the hero's bed.</l>

<l n="92">Now placed in order, the Phæacian train</l>
<l n="93">Their cables loose, and launch into the main:</l>
<l n="94">At once they bend, and strike their equal oars,</l>

<l n="96">While on the deck the chief in silence lies,</l>

<note n="211.1">The place seems to have been fitted up as a temple, and Pope very
properly supposes that, on solemn occasions, the statues of the gods were
carried in procession through the southern gate, which was consecrated to
that purpose.</note>
<note n="211.2">It was necessary for Ulysses to land alone, in
order to his concealment; if he had been discovered, the suitors would im-
mediately have destroyed him, if not as the real Ulysses, yet under the
pretext of his being an impostor. Now if he had been waked, the Phœa-
cians would have been obliged to have attended him, which he could not
have denied with decency, nor accepted with safety. Homer, therefore,
had no other way left to unravel his fable happily. Dacier. Plutarch, in
his treatise of "Reading the Poets," tells us, that there was a tradition
that Ulysses was naturally drowsy. His greatest calamities arise from
his sleeping: when he was ready to land upon his own country by the
favour of Æolus, he falls asleep, and his companions let loose a wind
that bears him from it; he is asleep while they kill the oxen of Apollo;
and here he sleeps while upon his own country. Plutarch is of opinion,
that Ulysses feigned this sleep to rid himself of the Phæacians without
embarrassment, being ashamed to dismiss them without entertainment and
gifts of hospitality. But Homer himself seems to give a natural reason in
the subsequent verses. Pope.</note>
<note n="211.3">That the Phæacians should fly away
in secret is no wonder: Ulysses had, by the mouth of the prophet Tiresias,
told the Phæacians that the suitors plotted his destruction; and therefore,
the mariners might very reasonably be apprehensive that the suitors would
use any persons as enemies, who should contribute to restore Ulysses to his
country. This is the reason why they made this voyage by night; namely,
to avoid discovery. Eustathius remarks, that the Phæacians, being an
unwarlike nation, were afraid to teach any person the way to their own
country, by discovering the course of navigation to it. Pope.</note>

<argument>
<p>THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMÆUS.</p>
<p>Ulysses arrives in disguise at the house of Eumæus, where he is received,
entertained, and lodged with the utmost hospitality. The several dis-
courses of that faithful old servant, with the feigned story told by Ulys-
ses to conceal himself, and other conversations on various subjects, take
up this entire book.</p>
</argument>
<l n="1">BUT he, deep-musing, o'er the mountains stray'd</l>
<l n="2">Through mazy thickets of the woodland shade,</l>
<l n="3">And cavern'd ways, the shaggy coast along,</l>
<l n="4">With cliffs and nodding forests overhung.</l>
<l n="5">Eumæus at his sylvan lodge he sought,</l>
<l n="6">A faithful servant, and without a fault.</l>
<l n="7">Ulysses found him busied, as he sate</l>
<l n="8">Before the threshold of his rustic gate;</l>
<l n="9">Around, the mansion in a circle shone,</l>
<l n="10">A rural portico of rugged stone;</l>
<l n="11">(In absence of his lord, with honest toil</l>
<l n="12">His own industrious hands had rais'd the pile,)</l>
<l n="13">The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne,</l>
<l n="14">Encircled with a fence of native thorn,</l>
<l n="15">And strong with pales, by many a weary stroke</l>
<l n="16">Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak;</l>
<l n="17">Frequent and thick. Within the space were rear'd</l>
<l n="18">Twelve ample cells, the lodgments of his herd.</l>
<l n="19">Full fifty pregnant females each contain'd:</l>
<l n="20">The males without (a smaller race) remain'd;</l>
<l n="21">Doom'd to supply the suitors' wasteful feast,</l>
<l n="22">A stock by daily luxury decreas'd;</l>
<pb n="223"/>
<l n="23">Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend,</l>
<l n="24">Four savage dogs, a watchful guard, attend.</l>
<l n="25">Here sat Eumæus, and his cares applied</l>
<l n="26">To form strong buskins of well-season'd hide.</l>
<l n="27">Of four assistants who his labour share,</l>
<l n="28">Three now were absent on the rural care:</l>
<l n="29">The fourth drove victims to the suitor train:</l>
<l n="30">But he, of ancient faith, a simple swain,</l>
<l n="31">Sigh'd, while he furnish'd the luxurious board,</l>
<l n="32">And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord.</l>
<l n="33">Soon as Ulysses near th' inclosure drew,</l>
<l n="34">With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew:</l>
<l n="35">Down sate the sage, and, cautious to withstand,</l>
<l n="36">Let fall th' offensive truncheon from his hand.<ref n="223.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="37">Sudden, the master runs: aloud he calls;</l>
<l n="38">And from his hasty hand the leather<ref n="223.2">2</ref> falls;</l>
<l n="39">With showers of stones he drives them far away;</l>
<l n="40">The scattering dogs around at distance bay.</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Eumæus</speaker>
<l n="41">'Unhappy stranger!' (thus the faithful swain</l>
<l n="42">Began with accent gracious and humane,)</l>
<l n="43">'What sorrow had been mine, if at my gate</l>
<l n="44">'Thy reverend age had met a shameful fate!</l>
<l n="45">'Enough of woes already have I known:</l>
<l n="46">'Enough my master's sorrows and my own.</l>
<l n="47">'While here (ungrateful task!) his herds I feed,</l>
<l n="48">'Ordain'd for lawless rioters to bleed!</l>
<l n="49">'Perhaps, supported at another's board,</l>
<l n="50">'Far from his country roams my hapless lord!</l>
<l n="51">'Or sigh'd in exile forth his latest breath,</l>
<l n="52">'Now cover'd with th' eternal shade of death!</l>
<note n="223.1">Homer has been censured for representing his hero unworthily. Is it
probable that he who had met whole armies in battle should now throw
away his staff out of fear of a dog? that he should abandon his defence
by casting himself on the ground, and leave himself to his mercy? But
Eustathius fully vindicates Ulysses. It is a natural defence to avert the
fury of a dog, to cast away our weapons, to show that we intend him no
violence. Pliny has the like observation in the eighth book of his Natural
History: "The violent attack of a dog is checked by the person who is
the object of it, sitting down on the ground." Pope.</note>

<l n="53">'But enter this my homely roof, and see</l>
<l n="54">'Our woods not void of hospitality.</l>
<l n="55">'Then tell me whence thou art, and what the share</l>
<l n="56">'Of woes and wanderings thou wert born to bear.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="57">He said, and, seconding the kind request,</l>
<l n="58">With friendly step precedes his unknown guest.</l>
<l n="59">A shaggy goat's soft hide beneath him spread,</l>
<l n="60">And with fresh rushes heap'd an ample bed:</l>
<l n="61">Joy touch'd the hero's tender soul, to find</l>
<l n="62">So just reception from a heart so kind;</l>
<l n="63">And 'Oh, ye gods! with all your blessings grace'</l>
<l n="64">(He thus broke forth) 'this friend of human race!'</l>

<l n="65">The swain replied: 'It never was our guise</l>

<l n="77">'But Fate comdemn'd him to a foreign shore;</l>
<l n="78">'Much have I sorrow'd, but my master more.</l>
<l n="79">'Now cold he lies, to death's embrace resign'd:</l>
<l n="80">'Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind!</l>
<l n="81">'For whose curs'd cause, in Agamemnon's name,</l>
<l n="82">'He trod so fatally the paths of Fame.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="83">His vest succinct then girding round his waist,</l>
<l n="84">Forth rush'd the swain with hospitable haste;</l>
<l n="85">Straight to the lodgments of his herd he run,</l>
<l n="86">Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun;</l>
<l n="87">Of two, his cutlass launch'd the spouting blood;</l>
<l n="88">These, quarter'd, singed, and fix'd on forks of wood.</l>
<l n="89">All hasty on the hissing coals he threw;</l>
<l n="90">And, smoking, back the tasteful viands drew,</l>

<l n="93">With flour imbrown'd; next mingled wine yet new,</l>

<l n="95">Then sate, companion of the friendly feast,</l>

<l n="97">'Take with free welcome what our hands prepare,</l>

<l n="101">'Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest,</l>

<l n="103">'Pirates and conquerors of harden'd mind,</l>
<l n="104">'The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind,</l>
<l n="105">'To whom offending men are made a prey</l>
<l n="106">'When Jove in vengeance gives a land away;</l>
<l n="107">'Ev'n these, when of their ill-got spoils possess'd,</l>
<l n="108">'Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast:</l>
<l n="109">'Some voice of God close whispering from within,</l>
<l n="110">"'Wretch! this is villany, and this is sin.'</l>
<l n="111">'But these, no doubt, some oracle explore,</l>
<l n="112">'That tells, the great Ulysses is no more.</l>
<l n="113">'Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs</l>
<l n="114">'Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise:</l>
<l n="115">'Constant as Jove the night and day bestows,</l>

<note n="228.2">This whole narration is a notable instance of that artful dissimulation so remarkable in the character of Ulysses, and an evidence that Homer excellently sustains it through the whole poem. There is a pause in the action of the poem, while Minerva passes from Ithaca to Telemachus in Lacedæmon': this interval is to be filled up with some incident relating to Ulysses, until Telemachus is prepared to return; for his assistance is necessary to re-establish the affairs of Ulysses. This then is a time of leisure, and the poet fills it up with the narrations of Ulysses till the return of Telemachus, and consequently there is room for a long relation. Pope.</note>

<argument>
<p>THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.</p>
<p>The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca.
Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaüs, and arrive at Pylos, where
they part; Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theocly-
menus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumæus,
who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the mean-
time Telemachus arrives on the coast, and, sending the vessel to the town,
proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumæus.</p>
</argument>
<l n="1">Now had Minerva<ref n="239.1">1</ref> reach'd those ample plains,</l>
<l n="2">Fam'd for the dance, where Menelaüs reigns;</l>
<l n="3">Anxious she flies to great Ulysses' heir,</l>
<l n="4">His instant voyage challenged all her care.</l>
<l n="5">Beneath the royal portico display'd,</l>
<l n="6">With Nestor's son Telemachus was laid;</l>
<l n="7">In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies;</l>
<l n="8">Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal'd his eyes:<ref n="239.2">2</ref></l>
<l n="9">Restless he griev'd, with various fears oppress'd,</l>
<l n="10">And all thy fortunes roll'd within his breast.</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Minerva</speaker>
<l n="11">When, 'O Telemachus!' (the goddess said)</l>
<l n="12">'Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray'd,</l>
<l n="13">'Thus leaving careless thy paternal right</l>
<l n="14">'The robbers' prize, the prey to lawless might.</l>
<l n="15">'On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam,</l>
<l n="16">'Even now the hand of rapine sacks the dome.</l>
<note n="239.1">B. xiii. ver. 511.</note>
<note n="239.2">Minerva here finds Telemachus in bed. It is necessary to remember that
Ulysses landed in Ithaca in the morning of the thirty-fifth day; and when
Minerva left him, she went to the Spartan court to Telemachus; this vision
therefore appears to that hero in the night following the thirty-fifth day.
On the thirty-sixth he departs from Menelaus, and lodges that night with
Diocles; on the thirty-seventh he embarks towards the evening, sails all
night, and lands on the thirty-eighth in the morning in his own country.
From this observation it is likewise evident, that Ulysses passes two days
in discourse with Eumæus. Pope.</note>

<l n="17">'Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore</l>
<l n="18">'To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore:</l>
<l n="19">'Fly, whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands</l>
<l n="20">'Her kindred's wishes, and her sire's commands;</l>
<l n="21">'Through both, Eurymachus pursues the dame,</l>
<l n="22">'And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim.</l>
<l n="23">'Hence therefore, while thy stores thy own remain;</l>
<l n="24">'Thou know'st the practice of the female train;</l>
<l n="25">'Lost in the children of the present spouse,</l>
<l n="26">'They slight the pledges of their former vows;</l>
<l n="27">'Their love is always with the lover past;</l>
<l n="28">'Still the succeeding flame expels the last.</l>
<l n="29">'Let o'er thy house some chosen maid preside,</l>
<l n="30">'Till heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride.</l>
<l n="31">'But now thy more attentive ears incline,</l>

<l n="33">'For thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay</l>
<l n="34">'In Samos' sands, or straits of Ithaca;</l>
<l n="35">'To seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band,</l>

<l n="37">'No-sooner far their riot and their lust</l>
<l n="38">'All-covering earth shall bury deep in dust!</l>
<l n="39">'Then distant from the scatter'd islands steer,</l>
<l n="40">'Nor let the night retard thy full career;</l>
<l n="41">'Thy heavenly guardian shall instruct the gales</l>
<l n="42">'To smooth thy passage and supply thy sails:</l>
<l n="43">'And when at Ithaca thy labour ends,</l>
<l n="44">'Send to the town the vessel with thy friends;</l>
<l n="45">'But seek thou first the master of the swine,</l>
<l n="46">'(For still to thee his loyal thoughts incline;)</l>
<l n="47">'There pass the night; while he his course pursues</l>
<l n="48">'To bring Penelope the wish'd-for news,</l>
<l n="49">'That thou, safe sailing from the Pylian strand,</l>
<l n="50">'Art come to bless her in thy native land.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="51">Thus spoke the goddess, and resum'd her flight</l>
<l n="52">To the pure regions of eternal light.</l>
<l n="53">Meanwhile Pisistratus he gently shakes,</l>
<l n="54">And with these words the slumbering youth awakes:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="55">'Rise, son of Nestor; for the road prepare,</l>
<l n="56">'And join the harness'd coursers to the car.'</l>
</sp>
<pb n="241"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisistratus</speaker>
<l n="57">'What cause,' he cried, 'can justify our flight</l>
<l n="58">'To tempt the dangers of forbidding night?</l>
<l n="59">'Here wait we rather, till approaching day</l>
<l n="60">'Shall prompt our speed, and point the ready way.</l>
<l n="61">'Nor think of flight before the Spartan king</l>
<l n="62">'Shall bid farewell, and bounteous presents bring;</l>
<l n="63">'Gifts, which to distant ages safely stor'd,</l>
<l n="64">'The sacred act of friendship shall record.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="65">Thus he. But when the dawn bestreak'd the east,</l>
<l n="66">The king from Helen rose, and sought his guest.</l>
<l n="67">As soon as his approach the hero knew,</l>
<l n="68">The splendid mantle round him first he threw,</l>
<l n="69">Then o'er his ample shoulders whirl'd the cloak,</l>
<l n="70">Respectful met the monarch, and bespoke:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="71">'Hail, great Atrides, favour'd of high Jove!</l>
<l n="72">'Let not thy friends in vain for licence move.</l>
<l n="73">'Swift let us measure back the watery way,</l>
<l n="74">'Nor check our speed, impatient of delay.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaüs</speaker>
<l n="75">'If with desire so strong thy bosom glows,</l>
<l n="76">'Ill,' said the king, 'should I thy wish oppose:</l>
<l n="77">'For oft in others freely I reprove</l>
<l n="78">'The ill-tim'd efforts of officious love;</l>
<l n="79">'Who love too much, hate in the like extreme,</l>
<l n="80">'And both the golden mean alike condemn.</l>
<l n="81">'Alike he thwarts the hospitable end,</l>
<l n="82">'Who drives the free, or stays the hasty friend:</l>

<l n="84">'Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.</l>
<l n="85">'Yet stay, my friends, and in your chariot take</l>
<l n="86">'The noblest presents that our love can make;</l>
<l n="87">'Meantime commit we to our women's care</l>
<l n="88">'Some choice domestic viands to prepare;</l>
<l n="89">'The traveller, rising from the banquet gay,</l>
<l n="90">'Eludes the labours of the tedious way.</l>
<l n="91">'Then if a wider course shall rather please</l>
<l n="92">'Through spacious Argos and the realms of Greece,</l>
<l n="93">'Atrides in his chariot shall attend;</l>
<l n="94">'Himself thy convoy to each royal friend.</l>
<l n="95">'No prince will let Ulysses' heir remove</l>
<l n="96">'Without some pledge, some monument of love:</l>
<pb n="242"/>
<l n="97">'These will the cauldron, these the tripod give;</l>
<l n="98">'From those the well-pair'd mules we shall receive,</l>
<l n="99">'Or bowl emboss'd whose golden figures live.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="100">To whom the youth, for prudence fam'd, replied:</l>
<l n="101">'O monarch, care of heaven! thy people's pride!</l>
<l n="102">'No friend in Ithaca my place supplies,</l>
<l n="103">'No powerful hands are there, no watchful eyes:</l>
<l n="104">'My stores expos'd and fenceless house demand</l>
<l n="105">'The speediest succour from my guardian hand;</l>
<l n="106">'Lest, in a search too anxious and too vain</l>
<l n="107">'Of one lost joy, I lose what yet remain.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="108">His purpose when the generous warrior heard,</l>
<l n="109">He charged the household cates to be prepar'd.</l>
<l n="110">Now with the dawn, from his adjoining home,</l>
<l n="111">Was Boethœdes Eteoneus<ref n="242.1">1</ref> come;</l>
<l n="112">Swift at the word he forms the rising blaze,</l>
<l n="113">And o'er the coals the smoking fragments lays.</l>
<l n="114">Meantime the king, his son, and Helen went</l>
<l n="115">Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent.</l>
<l n="116">The king selected from the glittering rows</l>
<l n="117">A bowl; the prince a silver beaker chose.</l>
<l n="118">The beauteous queen revolv'd with careful eyes</l>
<l n="119">Her various textures of unnumber'd dyes,</l>
<l n="120">And chose the largest; with no vulgar art</l>
<l n="121">Her own fair hands embroider'd every part:</l>
<l n="122">Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright,</l>
<l n="123">Like radiant Hesper o'er the gems of night.</l>
<l n="124">Then with each gift they hastened to their guest,</l>
<l n="125">And thus the king Ulysses' heir address'd:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaüs</speaker>
<l n="126">'Since fix'd are thy resolves, may thundering Jove</l>
<l n="127">'With happiest omens thy desires approve!</l>
<l n="128">'This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine</l>
<l n="129">'Enchas'd with gold, this valued gift be thine;</l>
<l n="130">'To me this present, of Vulcanian frame,</l>
<l n="131">'From Sidon's hospitable monarch came;</l>
<l n="132">'To thee we now consign the precious load,</l>
<l n="133">'The pride of kings, and labour of a god.'</l>

<note n="242.1">That is, Eteoneus, the son of Boethoüs; the same that is mentioned B. iv. 31.</note>
<pb n="243"/>
<l n="134">Then gave the cup, while Megapenthe brought</l>
<l n="135">The silver vase with living sculpture wrought.</l>
<l n="136">The beauteous queen, advancing next, display'd</l>
<l n="137">The shining veil, and thus endearing said:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l n="138">'Accept, dear youth, this monument of love,</l>
<l n="139">'Long since, in better days, by Helen wove:</l>
<l n="140">'Safe in thy mother's care the vesture lay,</l>
<l n="141">'To deck thy bride, and grace thy nuptial day.</l>
<l n="142">'Meantime may'st thou with happiest speed regain</l>
<l n="143">'Thy stately palace, and thy wide domain.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="144">She said, and gave the veil; with grateful look</l>
<l n="145">The prince the variegated present took.</l>
<l n="146">And now, when through the royal dome they pass'd,</l>
<l n="147">High on a throne the king each stranger placed.</l>
<l n="148">A golden ewer th' attendant damsel brings,</l>
<l n="149">Replete with water from the crystal springs;</l>
<l n="150">With copious streams the shining vase supplies</l>
<l n="151">A silver laver of capacious size.</l>
<l n="152">They wash. The tables in fair order spread,</l>
<l n="153">The glittering canisters are crown'd with bread;</l>
<l n="154">Viands of various kinds allure the taste,</l>
<l n="155">Of choicest sort and savour; rich repast!</l>
<l n="156">Whilst Eteoneus portions out the shares,</l>
<l n="157">Atrides' son the purple draught prepares.</l>
<l n="158">And now, (each sated with the genial feast,</l>
<l n="159">And the short rage of thirst and hunger ceas'd,)</l>
<l n="160">Ulysses' son, with his illustrious friend,</l>
<l n="161">The horses join, the polish'd car ascend.</l>
<l n="162">Along the court the fiery steeds rebound,</l>
<l n="163">And the wide portal echoes to the sound.</l>
<l n="164">The king precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine</l>
<l n="165">(Libation destin'd to the powers divine)</l>
<l n="166">His right hand held: before the steeds he stands,</l>
<l n="167">Then, mix'd with prayers, he utters these commands:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaüs</speaker>
<l n="168">'Farewell, and prosper, youths! let Nestor know</l>
<l n="169">'What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow,</l>
<l n="170">'For all the proofs of his paternal care,</l>
<l n="171">'Through the long dangers of the ten years' war.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="172">'Ah! doubt not our report' (the prince rejoin'd)</l>

<pb n="244"/>
<l n="174">'And oh! return'd might we Ulysses meet!</l>
<l n="175">'To him thy presents show, thy words repeat:</l>
<l n="176">'How will each speech his grateful wonder raise!</l>
<l n="177">'How will each gift indulge us in thy praise!'</l>
</sp>
<l n="178">Scarce ended thus the prince, when on the right</l>
<l n="179">Advanced the bird of Jove: auspicious sight!</l>
<l n="180">A milk-white fowl his clinching talons bore,</l>
<l n="181">With care domestic pamper'd at the floor.</l>
<l n="182">Peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue,</l>
<l n="183">In solemn speed the bird majestic flew</l>
<l n="184">Full dexter to the car: the prosperous sight</l>
<l n="185">Fill'd every breast with wonder and delight.</l>
<l n="186">But Nestor's son the cheerful silence broke,</l>
<l n="187">And in these words the Spartan chief bespoke:</l>

<speaker>Pisistratus</speaker>
<l n="188">"Say if to us the gods these omens send,</l>
<l n="189">'Or fates peculiar to thyself portend?'</l>
</sp>
<l n="190">Whilst yet the monarch paus'd, with doubts oppress'd,</l>
<l n="191">The beauteous queen reliev'd his labouring breast:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l n="192">'Hear me,' (she cried,) 'to whom the gods have given</l>
<l n="193">'To read this sign, and mystic sense of heaven.</l>
<l n="194">'As thus the plumy sovereign of the air</l>
<l n="195">'Left on the mountain's brow his callow care,</l>
<l n="196">'And wander'd through the wide ethereal way</l>
<l n="197">'To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey;</l>
<l n="198">'So shall thy godlike father, toss'd in vain</l>
<l n="199">'Through all the dangers of the boundless main,</l>

<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="202">'Oh! if this promis'd bliss by thundering Jove'</l>

<l n="204">'To thee, as to some god, I'll temples raise,</l>
<l n="205">'And crown thy altars with the costly blaze.'</l>

<l n="206">He said; and, bending o'er his chariot, flung</l>

<l n="208">The bounding shafts upon the harness play,</l>

<note n="246.1">There is some obscurity in this genealogical history. Melampus was a prophet; he lived in Pylos, and was a person of great wealth; his uncle Neleus seized his riches, and detained them a whole year, to oblige him to recover his herds, detained by Iphiclus, in Phylace; he failed in the attempt, and was kept in prison by Iphiclus, the son of Phylacus. Bias, the brother of Melampus, was in love with Pero, the daughter of Neleus; Neleus, to engage Melampus more strongly in the enterprise, promises to give Pero in marriage to his brother Bias, upon the recovery of his herds from Iphiclus. At length Iphiclus releases Melampus from prison, upon his discovering to him how he might have an heir to succeed to his dominions, and rewards him with restoring the herds of Neleus; then Neleus retracts his promise, and refuses to give his daughter Pero to Bias, the brother of Melampus; upon this, Neleus and Melampus quarrel, and, engaging in single combat, Neleus is vanquished, and Melampus retires to Argos. See B. xi. ver. 351, seq. Pope.</note>
<note n="246.2">Eriphyle, the wife of Amphiaraus, was induced by a bribe to prevail on her husband to join in the war of the seven chiefs against Thebes, though she knew that he would perish in it. See note on B. xi. 406.</note>

True to the tropic changes of the year."</note>

<l n="575">'No race but thine shall Ithaca obey;</l>
<l n="576">'To thine, for ages, heaven decrees the sway.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="577">'Succeed the omens, gods!' (the youth rejoin'd:)</l>
<l n="578">'Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind,</l>
<l n="579">'And soon each envied happiness attend</l>

<l n="597">The hero trod the margin of the main,</l>
<l n="598">And reach'd the mansion of his faithful swain.</l>
<note n="255.1">We find that Telemachus intended to deliver Theoclymenus to the care
of Eurymachus: what then is the reason why he thus suddenly alters that
resolution, and intrusts him to Peiræus? This is occasioned by the dis-
covery of the skill of Theoclymenus in augury; he fears lest the suitors
should extort some prediction from him that might be detrimental to his
affairs, or, should he refuse it, to the person of Theoclymenus. Pope.</note>

<argument>
<p>THE DISCOVERY OF ULYSSES TO TELEMACHUS.</p>
<p>Telemachus, arriving at the lodge of Eumæus, sends him to carry Penelope
the news of his return. Minerva, appearing to Ulysses, commands him
to discover himself to his son. The princes, who had lain in ambush to
intercept Telemachus in his way, their project being defeated, return to
Ithaca.</p>
</argument>
<l n="1">SOON as the morning blush'd along the plains,</l>
<l n="2">Ulysses, and the monarch of the swains,</l>
<l n="3">Awake the sleeping fires, their meals prepare,</l>
<l n="4">And forth to pasture send the bristly care.</l>
<l n="5">The prince's near approach the dogs descry,</l>
<l n="6">And, fawning round his feet, confess their joy.</l>
<l n="7">Their gentle blandishment the king survey'd,</l>
<l n="8">Heard his resounding step, and instant said:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="9">'Some well-known friend, Eumæus, bends this way;</l>
<l n="10">'His steps I hear; the dogs familiar play.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="11">While yet he spoke, the prince advancing drew</l>
<l n="12">Nigh to the lodge, and now appear'd in view.</l>
<l n="13">Transported from his seat Eumæus sprung,</l>
<l n="14">Dropp'd the full bowl, and round his bosom hung;</l>
<l n="15">Kissing his cheek, his hand, while from his eye</l>
<l n="16">The tears rain'd copious in a shower of joy.</l>
<l n="17">As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves,</l>
<l n="18">From foreign climes an only son receives,</l>
<l n="19">(Child of his age,) with strong paternal joy,</l>
<l n="20">Forward he springs, and clasps the favourite boy:</l>
<l n="21">So round the youth his arms Eumæus spread,</l>
<l n="22">As if the grave had given him from the dead:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Eumæus</speaker>
<l n="23">'And is it thou? my ever-dear delight!</l>
<l n="24">'Oh, art thou come to bless my longing sight?</l>
<l n="25">'Never, I never hoped to view this day,</l>
<l n="26">'When o'er the waves you plough'd the desperate way.</l>
<pb n="257"/>
<l n="27">'Enter, my child! Beyond my hopes restor'd,</l>
<l n="28">'Oh give these eyes to feast upon their lord.</l>
<l n="29">'Enter, O seldom seen! for lawless powers</l>
<l n="30">'Too much detain thee from these sylvan bowers.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="31">The prince replied: 'Eumæus, I obey;</l>
<l n="32">'To seek thee, friend, I hither took my way.</l>
<l n="33">'But say, if in the court the queen reside</l>
<l n="34">'Severely chaste, or if commenc'd a bride?'</l>
</sp>
<l n="35">Thus he; and thus the monarch of the swains:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Eumæus</speaker>
<l n="36">'Severely chaste Penelope remains;</l>
<l n="37">'But, lost to every joy, she wastes the day</l>
<l n="38">'In tedious cares, and weeps the night away.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="39">He ended, and (receiving as they pass</l>
<l n="40">The javelin, pointed with a star of brass,)</l>
<l n="41">They reach'd the dome: the dome with marble shin'd.</l>
<l n="42">His seat Ulysses to the prince resign'd.</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="43">'Not so,' (exclaims the prince with decent grace,)</l>
<l n="44">'For me, this house shall find a humbler place:</l>
<l n="45">'T' usurp the honours due to silver hairs</l>
<l n="46">'And reverend strangers modest youth forbears.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="47">Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies,</l>
<l n="48">And bids the rural throne with osiers rise.</l>
<l n="49">There sate the prince: the feast Eumæus spread,</l>
<l n="50">And heap'd the shining canisters with bread.</l>
<l n="51">Thick o'er the board the plenteous viands lay,</l>
<l n="52">The frugal remnants of the former day.</l>
<l n="53">Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines,</l>
<l n="54">Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines.</l>
<l n="55">And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled,</l>
<l n="56">Thus young Ulysses to Eumæus said:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="57">'Whence, father, from what shore this stranger, say?</l>
<l n="58">'What vessel bore him o'er the watery way?</l>
<l n="59">'To human step our land impervious lies,</l>
<l n="60">'And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eumæus</speaker>
<l n="61">The swain returns: 'A tale of sorrows hear:</l>
<l n="62">'In spacious Crete he drew his natal air;</l>
<l n="63">'Long doom'd to wander o'er the land and main,</l>
<l n="64">'For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain.</l>
<l n="65">'Half breathless 'scaping to the land he flew</l>
<l n="66">'From Thesprot' mariners, a murderous crew.</l>
<pb n="258"/>
<l n="67">'To thee, my son, the suppliant I resign;</l>
<l n="68">'I gave him my protection, grant him thine.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="69">'Hard task' (he cries) 'thy virtue gives thy friend,</l>
<l n="70">'Willing to aid, unable to defend.</l>
<l n="71">'Can strangers safely in the court reside,</l>
<l n="72">''Midst the swill'd insolence of lust and pride?</l>
<l n="73">'Even I unsafe: the queen in doubt to wed,</l>
<l n="74">'Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed.</l>
<l n="75">'Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame,</l>
<l n="76">'Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name.</l>
<l n="77">'However, stranger! from our grace receive</l>
<l n="78">'Such honours as befit a prince to give;</l>
<l n="79">'Sandals, a sword and robes, respect to prove,</l>
<l n="80">'And safe to sail with ornaments of love.</l>
<l n="81">'Till then, thy guest amid the rural train,</l>
<l n="82">'Far from the court, from danger far, detain.</l>
<l n="83">''Tis mine with food the hungry to supply,</l>
<l n="84">'And clothe the naked from th' inclement sky.</l>
<l n="85">'Here dwell in safety from the suitors' wrongs,</l>
<l n="86">'And the rude insults of ungovern'd tongues.</l>
<l n="87">'For, should'st thou suffer, powerless to relieve,</l>
<l n="88">'I must behold it, and can only grieve.</l>
<l n="89">'The brave encompass'd by an hostile train,</l>
<l n="90">'O'erpower'd by numbers, is but brave in vain.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="91">To whom, while anger in his bosom glows,</l>
<l n="92">With warmth replies the man of mighty woes:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="93">'Since audience mild is deign'd, permit my tongue</l>
<l n="94">'At once to pity and resent thy wrong.</l>
<l n="95">'My heart weeps blood to see a soul so brave</l>
<l n="96">'Live to base insolence of power a slave.</l>
<l n="97">'But tell me, dost thou, prince, dost thou behold,</l>
<l n="98">'And hear their midnight revels uncontroll'd?</l>
<l n="99">'Say, do thy subjects in bold faction rise,</l>
<l n="100">'Or priests in fabled oracles advise?</l>
<l n="101">'Or are thy brothers, who should aid thy power,</l>
<l n="102">'Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour?</l>
<l n="103">'Oh that I were from great Ulysses sprung,</l>
<l n="104">'Or that these wither'd nerves like thine were strung!</l>
<l n="105">'Or, heavens! might he return! (and soon appear</l>
<l n="106">'He shall, I trust; a hero scorns despair;)</l>
<pb n="259"/>
<l n="107">'Might he return, I yield my life a prey</l>
<l n="108">'To my worst foe, if that avenging day</l>
<l n="109">'Be not their last: but should I lose my life,</l>
<l n="110">'Oppress'd by numbers in the glorious strife,</l>
<l n="111">'I choose the nobler part, and yield my breath,</l>
<l n="112">'Rather than bear dishonour, worse than death;</l>
<l n="113">'Than see the hand of violence invade</l>
<l n="114">'The reverend stranger, and the spotless maid;</l>
<l n="115">'Than see the wealth of kings consum'd in waste,</l>
<l n="116">'The drunkards' revel, and the gluttons' feast.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="117">Thus he, with anger flashing from his eye;</l>
<l n="118">Sincere the youthful hero made reply:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="119">'Nor leagued in factious arms my subjects rise,</l>
<l n="120">'Nor priests in fabled oracles advise;</l>
<l n="121">'Nor are my brothers, who should aid my power,</l>
<l n="122">'Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour.</l>
<l n="123">'Ah me! I boast no brother; heaven's dread king</l>
<l n="124">'Gives from our stock an only branch to spring:</l>
<l n="125">'Alone Laërtes reign'd Arcesius' heir,</l>
<l n="126">'Alone Ulysses drew the vital air,</l>
<l n="127">'And I alone the bed connubial graced,</l>
<l n="128">'An unbless'd offspring of a sire unbless'd!</l>
<l n="129">'Each neighbouring realm, conducive to our woe,</l>
<l n="130">'Sends forth her peers, and every peer a foe:</l>
<l n="131">'The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills,</l>
<l n="132">'And lofty Zacynth crown'd with shady hills.</l>
<l n="133">'Even Ithaca and all her lords invade</l>
<l n="134">'Th' imperial sceptre, and the regal bed:</l>
<l n="135">'The queen, averse to love, yet aw'd by power,</l>
<l n="136">'Seems half to yield, yet flies the bridal hour:</l>
<l n="137">'Meantime their licence uncontroll'd I bear;</l>
<l n="138">'Even now they envy me the vital air:</l>
<l n="139">'But Heaven will sure revenge, and gods there are.</l>
<l n="140">'But go, Eumæus! to the queen impart</l>
<l n="141">'Our safe return, and ease a mother's heart.</l>
<l n="142">'Yet secret go; for numerous are my foes,</l>
<l n="143">'And here at least I may in peace repose.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eumæus</speaker>
<l n="144">To whom the swain: 'I hear and I obey:</l>
<l n="145">'But old Laërtes weeps his life away,</l>

<l n="147">'To bless his age; a messenger of joy?</l>
<l n="148">'The mournful hour that tore his son away</l>
<l n="149">'Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray;</l>
<l n="150">'Yet, busied with his slaves, to ease his woe,</l>

<l n="152">'Nor food nor wine refused; but, since the day</l>
<l n="153">'That you to Pylos plough'd the watery way,</l>
<l n="154">'Nor wine nor food he tastes; but, sunk in woes,</l>
<l n="155">'Wild springs the vine, no more the garden blows.</l>

<l n="162">'But to the queen with speed despatchful bear</l>
<l n="163">'Our safe return, and back with speed repair;</l>
<l n="164">'And let some handmaid of her train resort</l>

</sp>
<l n="166">While yet he spoke, impatient of delay,</l>
<l n="167">He braced his sandals on, and strode away:</l>
<l n="168">Then from the heavens the martial goddess flies</l>
<l n="169">Through the wide fields of air, and cleaves the skies:</l>
<l n="170">In form, a virgin in soft beauty's bloom,</l>
<l n="171">Skill'd in th' illustrious labours of the loom.</l>
<l n="172">Alone to Ithacus she stood display'd,</l>
<l n="173">But, unapparent as a viewless shade,</l>
<l n="174">Escap'd Telemachus: (the powers above,</l>
<l n="175">Seen or unseen, o'er earth at pleasure move:)</l>
<l n="176">The dogs intelligent confess'd the tread</l>

<l n="178">The goddess, beckoning, waves her deathless hands:</l>
<l n="179">Dauntless the king before the goddess stands.</l>
<note n="260.1">This may seem ridiculous, to ascribe a greater sagacity to the brute
creation than to man; but it may be answered, that it was the design of
the goddess to be invisible only to Telemachus, and consequently she was
visible to the dogs. But I am willing to believe that there is a deeper
meaning; and perhaps Homer speaks thus, to give us to understand that
the brute creation itself confesses the divinity. Dacier.</note>

<note n="268.1">This whole discourse of Eurymachus is to be understood by the way
of contrariety: there is an obvious and a latent interpretation; for instance,
when he says,
<quote>His blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear,</quote>
it obviously means the blood of the person who offers violence to Telemachus; but it may likewise mean the blood of Telemachus, and the construction admits both interpretations; thus also when he says, that no person shall lay hands upon Telemachus, while he is alive, he means that he will do it himself: and lastly, when he adds,
<quote>Then fear no mortal arm; if Heaven destroy, &amp;c.</quote>
the apparent signification is, that Telemachus has occasion only to fear a
natural death; but he means if the oracle of Jupiter commands them to
destroy Telemachus, that then the suitors will take away his life; alluding
to the foregoing speech of Amphinomus. EUSTATHIUS. Pope.</note>

Ulysses is conducted by Eumæus to the palace, where his old dog Argus

<l n="250">'The good old proverb how this pair fulfil!</l>

<note n="275.1">The male representative of the rebellious vassalage of Ulysses is the
goatherd Melanthius. The female ringleader of the same faction is Melantho, waiting-maid of Penelope. The correspondence of name and disposition naturally leads to suspect some blood-relationship between the two. Nowhere, however, is there any notice to that effect on the part of Homer. It is only by collation of incidental passages at widely distant intervals, that we are led to infer they are brother and sister. Melantho is described, in xviii. 321, as the daughter of Dolius, head gardener, and favourite servant of Laërtes, and as having been educated by Penelope, with great tenderness, for her own service, but now lost to all sense of shame or duty, and the mistress of Eurymachus. Melanthius is also styled son of Dolius; and, although it is nowhere said that this Dolius was the same person as the father of Melantho, the fact may be inferred from the circumstance of her paramour Eurymachus being also described as the patron of Melanthius, who, accordingly, occupies a place by his side when admitted to the table of the suitors. The intimacy with the sister sufficiently explains the favour to the brother. Mure's Hist. of the Language and Literature of Greece, vol. i. p. 378.</note>

<l n="403">Then gave a sign, and beckon'd him to come.</l>
<l n="404">There stood an empty seat, where late was placed,</l>
<l n="405">In order due, the steward of the feast,</l>
<l n="406">(Who now was busied carving round the board,)</l>
<l n="407">Eumæus took, and placed it near his lord.</l>
<l n="408">Before him instant was the banquet spread,</l>
<l n="409">And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread.</l>
<l n="410">Next came Ulysses lowly at the door,</l>
<l n="411">A figure despicable, old, and poor,</l>
<l n="412">In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent,</l>
<l n="413">Propp'd on a staff, and trembling as he went.</l>
<l n="414">Then resting on the threshold of the gate,</l>

<l n="423">'How ill, alas! do want and shame agree!'</l>
</sp>
<l n="424">His lord's command the faithful servant bears:</l>
<l n="425">The seeming beggar answers with his prayers:</l>

<l n="470">'It is not so with want! how few that feed</l>

uttered these words, Telemachus sneezes; Penelope accepts the omen, and
expects the words to be verified. The sneeze coming from the head, the
seat of thought and reason, the ancients looked upon it as a sign or omen,
and believed it to be sent by Jupiter. See Xenophon's Anabasis, B. iii. c. 2.</note>

<argument>
<p>THE FIGHT OF ULYSSES AND IRUS.</p>
<p>The beggar Irus insults Ulysses; the suitors encourage the fray, and promise
the victor a reward. Ulysses seconds the challenge, sends the beggar with
a single blow to the ground, receives the prize, and invites the suitors to
a similar trial. On which bright pleasantry of Ulysses, the suitors fall into
a loud laugh. Penelope descends, and receives the presents of the suitors.

<l n="26">'This is the threshold, this the common room;</l>
<l n="27">'Let both enjoy the hospitable dome.</l>
<l n="28">'Forbear to tempt my rage; I boast a soul</l>
<l n="29">'Not yet by years extinguish'd to control</l>
<l n="30">'The proudest foe, that dares in arms appear,</l>
<l n="31">'And fix the brand of infamy and fear.</l>
<l n="32">'Hence, from my sight! or, if it be thy fate</l>
<l n="33">'To fall, receive it, ere it be too late:</l>
<l n="34">'Or if we must our might in combat try,</l>
<l n="35">'By the firm issue of a single die<ref n="290.1">1</ref></l>
<l n="36">'Let all be govern'd.' He concludes his speech</l>
<l n="37">With dark design, and soul-ennobling stretch</l>
<l n="38">Of all his limbs. The suitor train look on,</l>
<l n="39">And laugh, indulgent, to behold their own.</l>
<l n="40">The king then call'd his friends: the fight to grace</l>
<l n="41">He bids the rivals to the middle space;</l>
<l n="42">Then tenders these conditions of the prize:</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antinoüs</speaker>
<l n="43">'A goat's soft entrails, black with clotted gore,</l>
<l n="44">'Lie broiling on the hearth, a savoury store;</l>
<l n="45">'Who first in combat foils his rival bold,</l>
<l n="46">'His be this prize, and be his right enroll'd</l>
<l n="47">'To feast with us, and from our bowl to drain</l>
<l n="48">'The sprightly nectar of the purple plain.'</l>
</sp>
<note n="290.1">By this expression, which does not appear in the original, the translator
seems to refer to the combat between Hector and Ajax, in the Iliad, where
it is said that the lot of Ajax leaped out of the helmet, and thus determined
him for the combat, a mark of the interposition of the deity in his favour.
See Iliad, B. vii. 219.</note>
<pb n="291"/>
<l n="49">He spoke. The king of all the suitor train,</l>
<l n="50">Antinoüs, with a careless smile began:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Antinoüs</speaker>
<l n="51">'What god, O peers! has sent this welcome guest,</l>
<l n="52">'To grace our banquet, and inflame the feast?</l>
<l n="53">'Contentious he, for strife prepared he stands,</l>
<l n="54">'And feeds the clamour of the noisy bands.</l>
<l n="55">'This pair of rivals, bent on martial toil,</l>
<l n="56">'Shall now decide the honours of the soil,</l>
<l n="57">'Who best can fight, to him the prize we'll give,</l>
<l n="58">'The first, the fairest portion of the live.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="59">The king assents, and now they all agree;</l>
<l n="60">Ulysses speaks, with thoughts mature and free:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="61">'My friends, I boast no more my youthful might,</l>
<l n="62">'Nor can I stand unequal in the fight.</l>
<l n="63">'But want, that urges, and that makes men bold,</l>
<l n="64">'Drives me to deeds unseemly for the old.</l>
<l n="65">'Yet, by the rights that guard a stranger's cause,</l>
<l n="66">'By all that's sacred in your country's laws,</l>
<l n="67">'Swear, that no hand shall secretly employ</l>
<l n="68">'A treacherous aid to crush the weak and boy.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="69">The peers assent, and in their minds approve</l>
<l n="70">His prudent speech: Telemachus above</l>
<l n="71">All others glows, and thus his words addressed:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="72">'Stranger, be bold; and what you speak, is just:</l>
<l n="73">'Fear not our peers, but in your prowess trust.</l>
<l n="74">'By our command, should any dare to lay</l>
<l n="75">'A secret hand on thee, that hand shall pay</l>
<l n="76">'The forfeit of his crime; and learn to fear</l>
<l n="77">'The man who claims a father's honour here.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="78">His words the suitor train with joy embrace,</l>
<l n="79">And rise tumultous from the festive place.</l>
<l n="80">Ulysses now his tatter'd vest untied,</l>
<l n="81">And to the sight his manly limbs supplied:</l>
<l n="82">Huge was his frame, his shoulders broad and bare,</l>
<l n="83">And, nerv'd with iron, all his members were.</l>
<l n="84">At once he stands magnificently high,</l>
<l n="85">And bears a terror in his awful eye.</l>
<l n="86">At once the suitors, struck with dread, admire</l>
<l n="87">The hero's make, and all his soul of fire.</l>
<l n="88">But pale and trembling stood his fainting foe,</l>
<l n="89">And fear'd in every joint the coming blow.</l>
<pb n="292"/>
<l n="90">Antinoüs saw it, and with scornful threat,</l>
<l n="91">'What idle boaster' (he began,) 'art thou!</l>
<l n="92">'Thus to thy better to misuse thy might?</l>
<l n="93">'Thou, whom Epirus' continent in flight</l>
<l n="94">'Shall soon receive; a load for kingly pride,</l>
<l n="95">'Echetus there, the terror of mankind.</l>
<l n="96">'He, with a ruthless hand, and iron shears,</l>
<l n="97">'Shall crop thy nose, and tear away thy ears.'</l>
<l n="98">He spoke; and both for combat now prepare;</l>
<l n="99">Ulysses thoughtful, with a cautious care,</l>
<l n="100">Now this, now that, revolved his active mind,</l>
<l n="101">How best to deal the blow, or where designed.</l>
<l n="102">To kill him at one stroke, he justly fear'd</l>
<l n="103">Would make his own discovery too soon heard:</l>
<l n="104">Or should he spare him, and not strike too hard,</l>
<l n="105">Some secret fraud might lurk within the guard.</l>
<l n="106">He held it best to strike a middle blow,</l>
<l n="107">That just might stun, but not o'erthrow the foe.</l>
<l n="108">Irus, with aim direct, his right hand sped,</l>
<l n="109">And grazed the shoulder of the hero's head.</l>
<l n="110">He, in return, with might collected, drew</l>
<l n="111">His arm, and just beneath the jaw-bone threw</l>
<l n="112">The stunning blow; the crashing bones resound,</l>
<l n="113">And the red torrent gushes on the ground.</l>
<l n="114">Supine he falls; the suitors laugh aloud;</l>
<l n="115">And the walls echo to the clamorous crowd.</l>
<l n="116">Ulysses then by the heel the vanquish'd drew</l>
<l n="117">Forth of the court, and to the dunghill threw,</l>
<l n="118">The wall and gate, and there in open view.</l>
<l n="119">With his own staff sustain'd, he bids him stand</l>
<l n="120">And guard the spot, and thus his words command:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="121">'Henceforth, O wretch, to dogs and swine a prey,</l>
<l n="122">'No more the poor and stranger drive away.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="123">He said, and o'er his shoulder flung the scrip,</l>
<l n="124">All patch'd and tatter'd, with its twisted whip.</l>
<l n="125">Then to the threshold he again repairs,</l>
<l n="126">And takes his seat, and tastes the festive cares.</l>
<l n="127">The peers with smiles the victor hero greet,</l>
<l n="128">And in these words their heart-felt joy complete:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>The Suitors</speaker>
<l n="129">'May Jove, and all the gods, O stranger, give</l>
<l n="130">'To see thee ever in this plenty live,</l>
<pb n="293"/>
<l n="131">'Who from our court hast made this plague to fly,</l>
<l n="132">'And sent so soon to drain the Stygian dry!'</l>
</sp>
<l n="133">Ulysses with a grateful smile complied,</l>
<l n="134">And with the promised prize his scrip supplied.</l>
<l n="135">Then Amphinomus, with a courteous grace,</l>
<l n="136">Two loaves of bread before the hero placed,</l>
<l n="137">And, filling high a bowl of rosy wine,</l>
<l n="138">Salutes the man divine, and thus began:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Amphinomus</speaker>
<l n="139">'Stranger, be bold! and may thy future state</l>
<l n="140">'Equal thy merits, and thy soul's debate.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="141">To whom with sighs: 'I once had wealth and fame,</l>
<l n="142">'A chief, a warrior, and a noble name.</l>
<l n="143">'But what I was, avails me not to tell,</l>
<l n="144">'In the dark scroll of what I am, I dwell.</l>
<l n="145">'Yet know, that all of human race are vain,</l>
<l n="146">'And fleeting as the breeze that skims the plain.</l>
<l n="147">'For while the gods their gifts on man bestow,</l>
<l n="148">'He thinks no ill, and fears no future woe.</l>
<l n="149">'But when the hand of Jove is stretch'd to wound,</l>
<l n="150">'The man, who late in pomp and pleasure drown'd,</l>
<l n="151">'Sinks in the storms of life, and bites the ground.</l>
<l n="152">'Such are the turns of fate; and I, who dare</l>
<l n="153">'To tell thee this, was once as thou art now,</l>
<l n="154">'A man of pleasure, and of worldly show;</l>
<l n="155">'And, trusting in my friends, and in my might,</l>
<l n="156">'I deem'd myself secure from fortune's spite.</l>
<l n="157">'Hence let no man be proud, no man be vain,</l>
<l n="158">'But with a secret awe his soul restrain.</l>
<l n="159">'For mark how vice, with virtue in her train,</l>
<l n="160">'Has in this house a double empire gain'd.</l>
<l n="161">'Ulysses, absent from his native shore,</l>
<l n="162">'No more shall see these walls, no more deplore</l>
<l n="163">'The ruin of his house; but fly with speed,</l>
<l n="164">'Ere yet he come, and all his foes shall bleed.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="165">He said, and pouring from the goblet's brim</l>
<l n="166">The purple wine, he gave the rest to him.</l>
<l n="167">The youth, with sad presage, and anxious heart,</l>
<l n="168">Turn'd from the prophet, and prepares to part.</l>
<l n="169">Yet not from death, by this advice, he flies;</l>
<l n="170">Minerva dooms him, and by Pallas' eyes</l>
<l n="171">He falls, a victim to her dread commands,</l>
<l n="172">And to the prowess of Telemachus' hands.</l>
<pb n="294"/>
<l n="173">Now to his seat the pensive youth repairs,</l>
<l n="144">And ponders in his mind the future cares.</l>
<l n="175">While thus the suitors, in their mirthful mood,</l>
<l n="176">With wine and music crown the festive board,</l>
<l n="177">Minerva dictates to the queen's high thought</l>
<l n="178">To show her charms, and make her beauty sought,</l>
<l n="179">That love's soft passion in their souls might rise,</l>
<l n="180">And her own son might grow more precious in her eyes.</l>
<l n="181">Subdued by sleep, she gently sinks to rest,</l>
<l n="182">And a soft slumber steals upon her breast.</l>
<l n="183">The goddess then with graces all her own</l>
<l n="184">Adorns her form, and makes her beauty known.</l>
<l n="185">Her cheeks she tinged with that celestial dye</l>
<l n="186">Which Venus wears, when she would charm the sky.</l>
<l n="187">Her brows she smooth'd, and every feature grace'd,</l>
<l n="188">And o'er her form a fuller lustre placed.</l>
<l n="189">Then from the skies descends, and stands unseen</l>
<l n="190">Within the threshold, and awakes the queen.</l>
<l n="191">She starts, she wakes, and with a sudden grace</l>
<l n="192">Her hand she waves, and veils her beauteous face:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Penelope</speaker>
<l n="193">'What dream,' (she cried,) 'was this, that stole my sense,</l>
<l n="194">'And wrapp'd my soul in softest indolence?</l>
<l n="195">'Oh, that the chaste Diana's vengeful dart</l>
<l n="196">'Might now transfix me, and relieve my heart!'</l>
</sp>
<l n="197">She said, and from her chamber's lofty height</l>
<l n="198">Descends, a beam of beauty, to the sight.</l>
<l n="199">Two virgin-maids, with decent steps, attend,</l>
<l n="200">And to the suitors' hall their progress bend.</l>
<l n="201">Full in the portal stands the matchless fair,</l>
<l n="202">And with a modest grace conceals her air.</l>
<l n="203">Her veil, in graceful folds, her cheeks o'erspread,</l>
<l n="204">And cast a soften'd shadow on her head.</l>
<l n="205">The suitors, struck with wonder and delight,</l>
<l n="206">Gaze on her charms, and sicken at the sight.</l>
<l n="207">Then to her son she speaks, and thus complains:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Penelope</speaker>
<l n="208">'What strange neglect, my son, thy youth detains?</l>
<l n="209">'Canst thou with patience see a stranger bleed,</l>
<l n="210">'And not resent the base unmanly deed?</l>
<l n="211">'A deed that bids the indignant world proclaim</l>
<l n="212">'Thy want of virtue, and thy mother's shame.'</l>
</sp>
<pb n="295"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="213">'O queen!' (he cried,) 'to whom all praise is due,</l>
<l n="214">'Thy just reproof I hear, and own it true.</l>
<l n="215">'But, strange to tell, my soul, that once was free,</l>
<l n="216">'Now sinks in grief, and is no more with me.</l>
<l n="217">'Yet, not unpunish'd shall the villain die,</l>
<l n="218">'Who dares with wrongs a stranger's worth to try.</l>
<l n="219">'But the just gods have otherwise decreed;</l>
<l n="220">'He falls, and by a mightier arm must bleed.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="221">Thus they: while, sunk in soft repose, the rest</l>
<l n="222">Indulge the pleasures of the genial feast.</l>
<l n="223">Eurymachus alone, with guileful grace,</l>
<l n="224">Arose, and thus bespoke the queen's fair face:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Eurymachus</speaker>
<l n="225">'O thou, whose charms the world with wonder view,</l>
<l n="226">'And own thy beauty to thy virtue due!</l>
<l n="227">'Did all the youths of Greece thy beauty know,</l>
<l n="228">'To thy all-conquering charms the world would bow,</l>
<l n="229">'And crowds of princes at thy feet would fall,</l>
<l n="230">'And this high dome would be too strait for all.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Penelope</speaker>
<l n="231">'Ah me!' (replies the queen,) 'my charms are fled,</l>
<l n="232">'With my dear lord, to dust and darkness dead.</l>
<l n="233">'But should he come, and bless my longing eyes,</l>
<l n="234">'What joys would rise, what glories would arise!</l>
<l n="235">'But he is gone; and all my hopes are vain;</l>
<l n="236">'And now I languish with a secret pain.</l>
<l n="237">'The nobles of the land my bed desire,</l>
<l n="238">'And with their presence all my soul they tire.</l>
<l n="239">'Far from my mind the thoughts of nuptial love,</l>
<l n="240">'I only wish my absent lord to prove.</l>
<l n="241">'But they, with gifts and vows, my soul invade,</l>
<l n="242">'And with their arts my resolutions shade.</l>
<l n="243">'For this they crowd my court, and waste my store,</l>
<l n="244">'And riot on the spoils of one no more.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="245">She spoke. Ulysses with a secret joy</l>
<l n="246">Heard the wise queen her subtle arts employ,</l>
<l n="247">To get new presents, and her grace to sell</l>
<l n="248">To those who thought they bought her love so well.</l>
<l n="249">Antinoüs now, with a dissembled smile,</l>
<l n="250">Thus artful speaks, her sorrows to beguile:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Antinoüs</speaker>
<l n="251">'O queen! if gifts can win thy soul to love,</l>
<l n="252">'A golden robe, with gems enchased, we'll prove</l>
<l n="253">'A sacred pledge of our united flame,</l>
<l n="254">'And justify the honour of thy name.'</l>
</sp>
<pb n="296"/>
<l n="255">He said, and from his train a herald brought</l>
<l n="256">A costly robe, with richest tissue wrought.</l>
<l n="257">Twelve golden clasps the circling zones infold,</l>
<l n="258">And, where they join, a clasp of beaming gold.</l>
<l n="259">Eurymachus, with equal haste, display'd</l>
<l n="260">A chain of gold, with amber richly laid.</l>
<l n="261">Eurydamas, with pendants for her ears,</l>
<l n="262">Two sparkling jewels, of the purest spheres.</l>
<l n="263">Pisander, from the spoil of realms afar,</l>
<l n="264">A costly necklace, radiant as a star.</l>
<l n="265">Each peer with gifts his gratitude express'd,</l>
<l n="266">And sooth'd with flattery the royal breast.</l>
<l n="267">She, with a graceful air, and look serene,</l>
<l n="268">Receives the whole, and thanks the generous train.</l>
<l n="269">Then to her chamber, with a sober pace,</l>
<l n="270">She moves, and with her maids resumes her place.</l>
<l n="271">Now in the court the festive torches burn,</l>
<l n="272">And to the dance the suitor train return.</l>
<l n="273">Ulysses now, with a fictitious air,</l>
<l n="274">Of watchful diligence, and faithful care,</l>
<l n="275">Assumes the task to guide the flaming light,</l>
<l n="276">And lead the revels of the festive night.</l>
<l n="277">But the bold suitors, with a scornful smile,</l>
<l n="278">Thus him revile, and thus the hours beguile:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>The Suitors</speaker>
<l n="279">'What art thou, wretch, who thus presum'st to stand</l>
<l n="280">'The torch of honour in thy coward hand?</l>
<l n="281">'Hence to the forge, and ply the sounding steel,</l>
<l n="282">'Or at the mill eternal labours feel.</l>
<l n="283">'Or if thy hands the rustic toil disdain,</l>
<l n="284">'Go, prune the vine, and cultivate the plain.</l>
<l n="285">'So shalt thou 'scape the town's contagious air,</l>
<l n="286">'And the lewd converse of the wanton fair.'</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ulysses</speaker>
<l n="287">To whom the king: 'O souls devoid of shame!</l>
<l n="288">'Who soil with foul reproach a stranger's name,</l>
<l n="289">'Who make the oppressed a butt for brutal rage,</l>
<l n="290">'And mock the weakness of declining age,</l>
<l n="291">'I swear by Jove, and all the powers above,</l>
<l n="292">'Should but my lord return with vows of love,</l>
<l n="293">'This instant would I fly to arms, and seize</l>
<l n="294">'The foremost in the ranks of my enemies.</l>
<l n="295">'Or if my arm, with age and toil unstrung,</l>
<l n="296">'Could not avenge the wrongs upon me flung,</l>
<pb n="297"/>
<l n="297">'My son should do it, and this hand should be</l>
<l n="298">'The first to set his injured father free.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="299">He spoke. The suitors, with a furious look,</l>
<l n="300">A peal of laughter from their bosoms broke.</l>
<l n="301">Then thus Eurymachus, with words of scorn,</l>
<l n="302">To the wise king his contumelious turn:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Eurymachus</speaker>
<l n="303">'What art thou, wretch, who thus, with brutal rage,</l>
<l n="304">'Insult'st the weakness of declining age?</l>
<l n="305">'Think'st thou we fear thy threats? or that thy son</l>
<l n="306">'Can do what thou thyself hast never done?</l>
<l n="307">'But, lo! the gods have sent a nobler guest,</l>
<l n="308">'To grace our banquet, and inflame the feast.</l>
<l n="309">'His bald pate shines with an unusual grace,</l>
<l n="310">'And looks like wisdom in a fool's own face.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="311">He said, and with a footstool aim'd the blow</l>
<l n="312">At the king's head, but miss'd the intended foe;</l>
<l n="313">It pass'd him, and, with an ill-omen'd sound,</l>
<l n="314">A hapless sewer smote, and stretch'd him on the ground.</l>
<l n="315">A loud acclaim the suitor train express'd,</l>
<l n="316">And thus the tumult of their souls confess'd:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>The Suitors</speaker>
<l n="317">'Would that this stranger, with his cursed face,</l>
<l n="318">'Had died, ere yet he reach'd this happy place!</l>
<l n="319">'Then had not this unseemly brawl been known,</l>
<l n="320">'Nor had our feast been with his presence thrown.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="321">Then thus Telemachus, with looks serene,</l>
<l n="322">And voice of mildness, moderates the scene:</l>
<sp>
<speaker>Telemachus</speaker>
<l n="323">'O friends! forbear; nor let your frantic rage</l>
<l n="324">'With brutal acts a stranger's woes engage.</l>
<l n="325">'The feast is done; let each in peace depart,</l>
<l n="326">'And secret own the dictates of his heart.'</l>
</sp>
<l n="327">He spoke. The suitors, with a sullen look,</l>
<l n="328">The sage advice of young Telemachus took.</l>
<l n="329">Then to their several homes they all repair,</l>
<l n="330">And leave the queen to solitude and care.</l>

        <argument>
          <p>Ulysses and his son remove the weapons out of the armoury; Ulysses, in conversation with Penelope, gives a fictitious account of his adventures; then assures her he had formerly entertained her husband in Crete; and describes exactly his person and dress; affirms to have heard of him in Phæacia and Thesprotia, and that his return is certain, and within a month. He then goes to bathe, and is attended by Euryclea, who discovers him to be Ulysses by the scar upon his leg, which he formerly received in hunting the wild boar on Parnassus. The poet inserts a digression relating that accident, with all its particulars.</p>

        <argument>
          <p>While Ulysses lies in the vestibule of the palace, he is witness to the disorders of the women. Minerva comforts him, and casts him asleep. At his waking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter, which is granted. The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the people, and the suitors banquet in the palace. Telemachus exerts his authority amongst them; notwithstanding which, Ulysses is insulted by Ctesippus, and the rest continue in their excesses. Strange prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus, the augur, who explains them to the destruction of the wooers.</p>

          <p>THE BENDING OF ULYSSES' BOW.</p>
          <p>Penelope, to put an end to the solicitations of the suitors, proposes to marry the person who shall first bend the bow of Ulysses, and shoot through the ringlets. After their attempts have proved ineffectual, Ulysses, taking Eumæus and Philætius apart, discovers himself to them; then returning, desires leave to try his strength at the bow, which, though refused with indignation by the suitors, Penelope and Telemachus cause to be delivered to his hands. He bends it immediately, and shoots through all the rings. Jupiter at the same instant thunders from heaven; Ulysses accepts the omen, and gives a sign to Telemachus, who stands ready armed at his side.</p>
        </argument>
        <l n="1">AND Pallas now, to raise the rivals' fires,</l>
        <l n="2">With her own art Penelope inspires:</l>
        <l n="3">Who now can bend Ulysses' bow,<ref n="333.1">1</ref> and wing</l>
        <l n="4">The well-aim'd arrow through the distant ring,</l>
        <l n="5">Shall end the strife, and win th' imperial dame:</l>
        <l n="6">But discord and black death await the game!</l>
        <l n="7">The prudent queen the lofty stair ascends;</l>
        <l n="8">At distance due a virgin-train attends:</l>
        <pb n="334"/>
        <l n="9">A brazen key she held, the handle turn'd,</l>
        <l n="10">With steel and polish'd elephant adorn'd:</l>
        <l n="11">Swift to the inmost room she bent her way,</l>
        <l n="12">Where, safe repos'd, the royal treasures lay;</l>
        <l n="13">There shone high heap'd the labour'd brass and ore,</l>
        <l n="14">And there the bow which great Ulysses bore;</l>
        <l n="15">And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept</l>
        <l n="16">Those winged deaths that many a matron wept.</l>
        <l n="17">This gift, long since when Sparta's shores he trod,</l>
        <l n="18">On young Ulysses Iphitus<ref n="334.1">1</ref> bestow'd:</l>
        <l n="19">Beneath Orsilochus's<ref n="334.2">2</ref> roof they met;</l>
        <l n="20">One loss was private, one a public debt;<ref n="334.3">3</ref></l>
        <l n="21">Messena's state from Ithaca detains</l>
        <l n="22">Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains;</l>
        <l n="23">And to the youthful prince to urge the laws,</l>
        <l n="24">The king and elders trust their common cause.</l>
        <l n="25">But Iphitus, employ'd on other cares,</l>
        <l n="26">Search'd the wide country for his wandering mares,</l>
        <l n="27">And mules, the strongest of the labouring kind;</l>
        <l n="28">Hapless to search! more hapless still to find!</l>
        <l n="29">For journeying on to Hercules, at length</l>
        <l n="30">That lawless wretch, that man of brutal strength,</l>
        <l n="31">Deaf to Heaven's voice, the social rite transgress'd;<ref n="334.4">4</ref></l>
        <l n="32">And for the beauteous mares destroy'd his guest.</l>
        <l n="33">He<ref n="334.5">5</ref> gave the bow; and on Ulysses' part</l>
        <l n="34">Receiv'd a pointed sword, and missile dart:</l>
        <l n="35">Of luckless friendship on a foreign shore</l>
        <l n="36">Their first, last pledges! for they met no more.</l>
        <l n="37">The bow, bequeath'd by this unhappy hand,</l>
        <l n="38">Ulysses bore not from his native land;</l>
        <l n="39">Nor in the front of battle taught to bend,</l>
        <l n="40">But kept in dear memorial of his friend.</l>
        <l n="41">Now, gently winding up the fair ascent,</l>
        <l n="42">By many an easy step, the matron went;</l>
        <pb n="335"/>
        <l n="43">Then o'er the pavement glides with grace divine,</l>
        <l n="44">(With polish'd oak the level pavements shine;)</l>
        <l n="45">The folding gates a dazzling light display'd,</l>
        <l n="46">With pomp of various architrave o'erlaid.</l>
        <l n="47">The bolt, obedient to the silken string,</l>
        <l n="48">Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring;</l>
        <l n="49">The wards respondent to the key turn round;</l>
        <l n="50">The bars fall back; the flying valves resound;</l>
        <l n="51">Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring,</l>

        <l n="55">There from the column, where aloft it hung,</l>
        <l n="56">Reach'd, in its splendid case, the bow unstrung;</l>
        <l n="57">Across her knees she laid the well-known bow,</l>
        <l n="58">And pensive sate, and tears began to flow.</l>

        <l n="61">To the proud suitors bears in pensive state</l>
        <l n="62">Th' unbended bow, and arrows wing'd with fate.</l>
        <l n="63">Behind, her train the polish'd coffer brings,</l>
        <l n="64">Which held th' alternate brass and silver rings.</l>
        <l n="65">Full in the portal the chaste queen appears,</l>
        <l n="66">And with her veil conceals the coming tears:</l>
        <l n="67">On either side awaits a virgin fair;</l>
        <l n="68">While thus the matron, with majestic air:</l>
        <l n="69">"Say you, whom these forbidden walls inclose,</l>
        <l n="70">For whom my victims bleed, my vintage flows,</l>
        <l n="71">If these neglected, faded charms can move?</l>
        <l n="72">Or is it but a vain pretence, you love?</l>
        <l n="73">If I the prize, if me you seek to wife,</l>

        <l n="81">Graceful she said, and bade Eumæus show</l>

        <pb n="336"/>
        <l n="83">From his full eyes the tears unbidden spring,</l>
        <l n="84">Touch'd at the dear memorials of his king.</l>
        <l n="85">Philætius too relents, but secret shed</l>
        <l n="86">The tender drops. Antinoüs saw, and said:</l>
        <l n="87">"Hence to your fields, ye rustics! hence away,</l>
        <l n="88">Nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day:</l>
        <l n="89">Nor to the royal heart recal in vain</l>
        <l n="90">The sad remembrance of a perish'd man.</l>
        <l n="91">Enough her precious tears already flow:</l>
        <l n="92">Or share the feast with due respect, or go</l>
        <l n="93">To weep abroad, and leave to us the bow:</l>
        <l n="94">No vulgar task! Ill suits this courtly crew</l>
        <l n="95">That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew.</l>
        <l n="96">I well remember, (for I gazed him o'er</l>
        <l n="97">While yet a child,) what majesty he bore!</l>
        <l n="98">And still (all infant as I was) retain</l>
        <l n="99">The port, the strength, the grandeur of the man."</l>
        <l n="100">He said, but in his soul fond joys arise,</l>
        <l n="101">And his proud hopes already win the prize.</l>
        <l n="102">To speed the flying shaft through every ring,</l>
        <l n="103">Wretch! is not thine: the arrows of the king</l>
        <l n="104">Shall end those hopes, and fate is on the wing!</l>
        <l n="105">Then thus Telemachus: "Some god I find</l>

        <l n="120">I shall not sorrow for a mother lost;</l>
        <l n="121">But, bless'd in her, possess these arms alone,</l>
        <l n="122">Heir of my father's strength, as well as throne."</l>
        <pb n="337"/>
        <l n="123">He spoke; then, rising, his broad sword unbound,</l>
        <l n="124">And cast his purple garment on the ground.</l>
        <l n="125">A trench he open'd; in a line he placed</l>
        <l n="126">The level axes, and the points made fast.</l>
        <l n="127">(His perfect skill the wondering gazers ey'd,</l>
        <l n="128">The game as yet unseen, as yet untried.)</l>
        <l n="129">Then, with a manly pace, he took his stand,</l>
        <l n="130">And grasp'd the bow, and twang'd it in his hand.</l>
        <l n="131">Three times, with beating heart, he made essay;</l>
        <l n="132">Three times, unequal to the task, gave way;</l>
        <l n="133">A modest boldness on his cheek appear'd;</l>
        <l n="134">And thrice he hoped, and thrice again he fear'd.</l>
        <l n="135">The fourth had drawn it. The great sire with joy</l>
        <l n="136">Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy.</l>
        <l n="137">His ardour straight th' obedient prince suppress'd,</l>
        <l n="138">And, artful, thus the suitor-train address'd:</l>
        <l n="139">"O lay the cause on youth yet immature!</l>
        <l n="140">(For Heaven forbid such weakness should endure!)</l>
        <l n="141">How shall this arm, unequal to the bow,</l>
        <l n="142">Retort an insult, or repel a foe?</l>
        <l n="143">But you! whom Heaven with better nerves has bless'd,</l>
        <l n="144">Accept the trial, and the prize contest."</l>
        <l n="145">He cast the bow before him, and apart</l>
        <l n="146">Against the polish'd quiver propp'd the dart.</l>
        <l n="147">Resuming then his seat, Eupithes' son,</l>
        <l n="148">The bold Antinoüs, to the rest begun:</l>
        <l n="149">"From where the goblet first begins to flow,</l>
        <l n="150">From right to left in order take the bow;</l>
        <l n="151">And prove your several strengths."—The princes heard,</l>
        <l n="152">And first Leiodes, blameless priest, appear'd:</l>
        <l n="153">The eldest born of Œnops' noble race,</l>
        <l n="154">Who next the goblet held his holy place;</l>
        <l n="155">He, only he, of all the suitor throng,</l>
        <l n="156">Their deeds detested, and abjur'd the wrong.</l>
        <l n="157">With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains,</l>
        <l n="158">The stubborn horn resisted all his pains!</l>
        <l n="159">Already in despair he gives it o'er:</l>
        <l n="160">"Take it who will," (he cries,) "I strive no more.</l>
        <l n="161">What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow!</l>
        <l n="162">What souls and spirits shall it send below!</l>
        <pb n="338"/>
        <l n="163">Better, indeed, to die, and fairly give</l>
        <l n="164">Nature her debt, than disappointed live,</l>
        <l n="165">With each new sun to some new hope a prey,</l>
        <l n="166">Yet still to-morrow falser than to-day.</l>
        <l n="167">How long in vain Penelope we sought!</l>
        <l n="168">This bow shall ease us of that idle thought,</l>
        <l n="169">And send us with some humbler wife to live,</l>
        <l n="170">Whom gold shall gain, or destiny shall give."</l>
        <l n="171">Thus speaking, on the floor the bow he placed:</l>
        <l n="172">(With rich inlay the various floor was graced;)</l>
        <l n="173">At distance far the feather'd shaft he throws,</l>
        <l n="174">And to the seat returns from whence he rose.</l>
        <l n="175">To him Antinoüs thus with fury said:</l>
        <l n="176">"What words ill-omen'd from thy lips have fled?</l>
        <l n="177">Thy coward-function ever is in fear;</l>
        <l n="178">Those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear.</l>
        <l n="179">Why should this bow be fatal to the brave,</l>
        <l n="180">Because the priest is born a peaceful slave?</l>
        <l n="181">Mark then what others can." He ended there,</l>
        <l n="182">And bade Melanthius a vast pile prepare;</l>
        <l n="183">He gives it instant flame, then fast beside</l>
        <l n="184">Spreads o'er an ample board a bullock's hide.</l>
        <l n="185">With melted lard they soak the weapon o'er,</l>
        <l n="186">Chafe every knot, and supple every pore.</l>
        <l n="187">Vain all their art, and all their strength as vain:</l>
        <l n="188">The bow inflexible resists their pain.</l>
        <l n="189">The force of great Eurymachus alone,</l>
        <l n="190">And bold Antinoüs, yet untried, unknown,</l>
        <l n="191">Those only now remain'd; but those confess'd</l>
        <l n="192">Of all the train the mightiest and the best.</l>
        <l n="193">Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew,</l>
        <l n="194">The masters of the herd and flock withdrew.</l>
        <l n="195">The king observes them; he the hall forsakes,</l>
        <l n="196">And past the limits of the court o'ertakes.</l>
        <l n="197">Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke:</l>
        <l n="198">"Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock!</l>
        <l n="199">Shall I the secret of my breast conceal,</l>
        <l n="200">Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell?</l>
        <l n="201">Say, should some favouring god restore again</l>
        <pb n="339"/>
        <l n="202">The lost Ulysses to his native reign,</l>
        <l n="203">How beat your hearts? what aid would you afford</l>
        <l n="204">To the proud suitors, or your ancient lord?"</l>
        <l n="205">Philætius thus: "O were thy word not vain!</l>
        <l n="206">Would mighty Jove restore that man again!</l>
        <l n="207">These aged sinews, with new vigour strung,</l>
        <l n="208">In his blest cause should emulate the young."</l>
        <l n="209">With equal vows Eumæus too implor'd</l>
        <l n="210">Each power above, with wishes for his lord.</l>
        <l n="211">He saw their secret souls, and thus began:</l>
        <l n="212">"Those vows the gods accord; behold the man!</l>
        <l n="213">Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain'd</l>
        <l n="214">By woes and wanderings from this hapless land:</l>
        <l n="215">At length he comes; but comes despis'd, unknown,</l>
        <l n="216">And finding faithful you, and you alone.</l>
        <l n="217">All else have cast him from their very thought,</l>
        <l n="218">Even in their wishes and their prayers forgot!</l>
        <l n="219">Hear then, my friends: If Jove this arm succeed,</l>
        <l n="220">And give yon impious revellers to bleed,</l>
        <l n="221">My care shall be to bless your future lives</l>
        <l n="222">With large possessions and with faithful wives:</l>
        <l n="223">Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend,</l>
        <l n="224">And each on young Telemachus attend,</l>
        <l n="225">And each be call'd his brother and my friend.</l>
        <l n="226">To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye;</l>
        <l n="227">Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh,</l>
        <l n="228">When with Autolycus's sons, of yore,</l>
        <l n="229">On Parnass' top I chas'd the tusky boar."</l>
        <l n="230">His ragged vest then drawn aside, disclos'd</l>
        <l n="231">The sign conspicuous, and the scar expos'd;</l>
        <l n="232">Eager they view'd; with joy they stood amaz'd;</l>
        <l n="233">With tearful eyes o'er all their master gaz'd:</l>
        <l n="234">Around his neck their longing arms they cast,</l>
        <l n="235">His head, his shoulders, and his knees embraced;</l>
        <l n="236">Tears followed tears; no word was in their power;</l>
        <l n="237">In solemn silence fell the kindly shower.</l>
        <l n="238">The king too weeps, the king too grasps their hands,</l>
        <l n="239">And moveless, as a marble fountain, stands.</l>
        <l n="240">Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun,</l>
        <l n="241">But first the wise man ceas'd, and thus begun:</l>
        <pb n="340"/>
        <l n="242">"Enough—on other cares your thought employ,</l>
        <l n="243">For danger waits on all untimely joy.</l>
        <l n="244">Full many foes, and fierce, observe us near;</l>
        <l n="245">Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear.</l>
        <l n="246">Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay</l>
        <l n="247">Some moments you, and let me lead the way.</l>
        <l n="248">To me, neglected as I am, I know</l>
        <l n="249">The haughty suitors will deny the bow;</l>
        <l n="250">But thou, Eumæus, as 'tis borne away,</l>
        <l n="251">Thy master's weapon to his hand convey.</l>
        <l n="252">At every portal let some matron wait,</l>
        <l n="253">And each lock fast the well-compacted gate:</l>
        <l n="254">Close let them keep, whate'er invades their ear;</l>
        <l n="255">Though arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear.</l>
        <l n="256">To thy strict charge, Philætius, we consign</l>
        <l n="257">The court's main gate; to guard that pass be thine."</l>
        <l n="258">This said, he first return'd; the faithful swains</l>
        <l n="259">At distance follow, as their king ordains.</l>
        <l n="260">Before the flame Eurymachus now stands,</l>
        <l n="261">And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands;</l>
        <l n="262">Still the tough bow unmov'd. The lofty man</l>
        <l n="263">Sigh'd from his mighty soul, and thus began;</l>
        <l n="264">"I mourn the common cause: for, oh my friends!</l>
        <l n="265">On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends!</l>
        <l n="266">Not the lost nuptials can affect me more,</l>
        <l n="267">(For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore,)</l>
        <l n="268">But baffled thus! confess'd so far below</l>
        <l n="269">Ulysses' strength, as not to bend his bow!</l>
        <l n="270">How shall all ages our attempt deride!</l>
        <l n="271">Our weakness scorn!" Antinoüs thus replied:</l>
        <l n="272">"Not so, Eurymachus: that no man draws</l>
        <l n="273">The wondrous bow, attend another cause.</l>
        <l n="274">Sacred to Phœbus is the solemn day,</l>
        <l n="275">Which thoughtless we in games would waste away;</l>
        <l n="276">Till the next dawn this ill-tim'd strife forego,</l>
        <l n="277">And here leave fix'd the ringlets in a row.</l>
        <l n="278">Now bid the sewer approach, then let us join</l>
        <l n="279">In due libations, and in rites divine;</l>
        <l n="280">So end our night; before the day shall spring,</l>
        <l n="281">The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring;</l>
        <pb n="341"/>
        <l n="282">Let then to Phœbus' name the fatted thighs</l>
        <l n="283">Feed the rich smokes, high curling to the skies.</l>
        <l n="284">So shall the patron of these arts bestow</l>
        <l n="285">(For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow."</l>
        <l n="286">They heard well pleas'd; the ready heralds bring</l>
        <l n="287">The cleansing waters from the limpid spring;</l>
        <l n="288">The goblet high with rosy wine they crown'd,</l>
        <l n="289">In order circling to the peers around.</l>
        <l n="290">That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man,</l>
        <l n="291">And thus his meditated scheme began;</l>
        <l n="292">"If what I ask your noble minds approve,</l>
        <l n="293">Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!</l>
        <l n="294">Chief, if it hurt not great Antinoüs' ear,</l>
        <l n="295">(Whose sage decision I with wonder hear,)</l>
        <l n="296">And if Eurymachus the motion please,</l>
        <l n="297">Give Heaven this day, and rest the bow in peace.</l>
        <l n="298">To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize,</l>
        <l n="299">And take it he, the favour'd of the skies!</l>
        <l n="300">But, since till then this trial you delay,</l>

        <l n="304">If yet this arm its ancient force retain;</l>
        <l n="305">Or if my woes (a long-continued train)</l>
        <l n="306">And wants and insults, make me less than man."</l>
        <l n="307">Rage flash'd in lightning from the suitors' eyes,</l>
        <l n="308">Yet mix'd with terror at the bold emprise.</l>

        <l n="387">Till gentle Pallas, piteous of her cries,</l>
        <l n="388">In slumber clos'd her silver-streaming eyes.</l>
        <pb n="344"/>
        <l n="389">Now through the press the bow Eumæus bore,</l>
        <l n="390">And all was riot, noise, and wild uproar.</l>
        <l n="391">"Hold! lawless rustic! whither wilt thou go?</l>
        <l n="392">To whom, insensate, dost thou bear the bow?</l>
        <l n="393">Exil'd for this to some sequester'd den,</l>
        <l n="394">Far from the sweet society of men,</l>
        <l n="395">To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made;</l>
        <l n="396">If Heaven and Phœbus lend the suitors aid."</l>
        <l n="397">Thus they. Aghast he laid the weapon down,</l>
        <l n="398">But bold Telemachus thus urged him on:</l>
        <l n="399">"Proceed, false slave, and slight their empty words;</l>
        <l n="400">What! hopes the fool to please so many lords?</l>
        <l n="401">Young as I am, thy prince's vengeful hand</l>
        <l n="402">Stretch'd forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land.</l>
        <l n="403">Oh! could the vigour of this arm as well</l>
        <l n="404">Th' oppressive suitors from my walls expel!</l>
        <l n="405">Then what a shoal of lawless men should go</l>
        <l n="406">To fill with tumult the dark courts below!"</l>
        <l n="407">The suitors with a scornful smile survey</l>
        <l n="408">The youth, indulging in the genial day.</l>
        <l n="409">Eumæus, thus encouraged, hastes to bring</l>
        <l n="410">The strifeful bow, and gives it to the king.</l>
        <l n="411">Old Euryclea calling then aside,</l>
        <l n="412">"Hear what Telemachus enjoins" (he cried):</l>
        <l n="413">"At every portal let some matron wait,</l>
        <l n="414">And each lock fast the well-compacted gate;</l>
        <l n="415">And if unusual sounds invade their ear,</l>
        <l n="416">If arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear,</l>
        <l n="417">Let none to call or issue forth presume,</l>
        <l n="418">But close attend the labours of the loom."</l>
        <l n="419">Her prompt obedience on his order waits;</l>
        <l n="420">Clos'd in an instant were the palace gates.</l>
        <l n="421">In the same moment forth Philætius flies,</l>
        <l n="422">Secures the court, and with a cable ties</l>
        <l n="423">The utmost gate; (the cable strongly wrought</l>
        <l n="424">Of Byblos' reed, a ship from Egypt brought;)</l>
        <l n="425">Then unperceiv'd and silent at the board</l>
        <l n="426">His seat he takes, his eyes upon his lord.</l>
        <l n="427">And now his well-known bow the master bore,</l>
        <l n="428">Turn'd on all sides, and view'd it o'er and o'er;</l>
        <pb n="345"/>
        <l n="429">Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong,</l>
        <l n="430">Its owner absent, and untried so long.</l>
        <l n="431">While some deriding—"How he turns the bow!</l>
        <l n="432">Some other like it sure the man must know,</l>
        <l n="433">Or else would copy; or in bows he deals;</l>
        <l n="434">Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals."—</l>
        <l n="435">"Heaven to this wretch" (another cried) "be kind!</l>
        <l n="436">And bless, in all to which he stands inclin'd,</l>
        <l n="437">With such good fortune as he now shall find."</l>
        <l n="438">Heedless he heard them: but disdain'd reply,</l>
        <l n="439">The bow perusing with exactest eye.</l>
        <l n="440">Then, as some heavenly minstrel, taught to sing</l>
        <l n="441">High notes responsive to the trembling string,</l>
        <l n="442">To some new strain when he adapts the lyre,</l>
        <l n="443">Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire,</l>
        <l n="444">Relaxes, strains, and draws them to and fro;</l>
        <l n="445">So the great master drew the mighty bow:</l>
        <l n="446">And drew with ease. One hand aloft display'd</l>
        <l n="447">The bending horns, and one the string essay'd.</l>
        <l n="448">From his essaying hand the string let fly</l>
        <l n="449">Twang'd short and sharp like the shrill swallow's cry.</l>
        <l n="450">A general horror ran through all the race,</l>
        <l n="451">Sunk was each heart, and pale was every face.</l>
        <l n="452">Signs from above ensued: th' unfolding sky</l>
        <l n="453">In lightning burst; Jove thunder'd from on high.</l>
        <l n="454">Fir'd at the call of heaven's almighty Lord,</l>
        <l n="455">He snatch'd the shaft that glitter'd on the board:</l>
        <l n="456">(Fast by, the rest lay sleeping in the sheath,</l>
        <l n="457">But soon to fly, the messengers of death.)</l>
        <l n="458">Now, sitting as he was, the cord he drew,</l>
        <l n="459">Through every ringlet levelling his view;</l>
        <l n="460">Then notch'd the shaft, releas'd, and gave it wing;</l>
        <l n="461">The whizzing arrow vanish'd from the string,</l>
        <l n="462">Sung on direct, and threaded every ring.</l>
        <l n="463">The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds;</l>
        <l n="464">Pierced through and through, the solid gate resounds.</l>
        <l n="465">Then to the prince: "Nor have I wrought thee shame;</l>
        <l n="466">Nor err'd this hand unfaithful to its aim;</l>
        <l n="467">Nor prov'd the toil too hard; nor have I lost</l>

        <l n="469">Ill I deserv'd these haughty peers' disdain;</l>
        <l n="470">Now let them comfort their dejected train,</l>

        <l n="473">Then to the lute's soft voice prolong the night;</l>
        <l n="474">Music, the banquet's most refined delight."</l>
        <l n="475">He said, then gave a nod; and at the word</l>
        <l n="476">Telemachus girds on his shining sword.</l>
        <l n="477">Fast by his father's side he takes his stand:</l>

        <argument>
          <p>THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.</p>
          <p>Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinoüs. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists, and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumæus, and Philætius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy.</p>
        </argument>
        <l n="1">THEN fierce the hero o'er the threshold strode;</l>
        <l n="2">Stripp'd of his rags, he blaz'd out like a god.<ref n="346.2">2</ref></l>
        <pb n="347"/>
        <l n="3">Full in their face the lifted bow he bore,</l>
        <l n="4">And quiver'd deaths, a formidable store;</l>
        <l n="5">Before his feet the rattling shower he threw,</l>
        <l n="6">And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew:</l>
        <l n="7">"One venturous game this hand hath won to-day,</l>
        <l n="8">Another, princes! yet remains to play;</l>
        <l n="9">Another mark our arrow must attain.</l>
        <l n="10">Phœbus, assist! nor be the labour vain."</l>
        <l n="11">Swift as the word the parting arrow sings,</l>
        <l n="12">And bears thy fate, Antinoüs, on its wings:</l>
        <l n="13">Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!</l>
        <l n="14">High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl!</l>
        <l n="15">Even then to drain it lengthen'd out his breath;</l>
        <l n="16">Changed to the deep, the bitter draught of death:</l>
        <l n="17">For fate who fear'd amidst a feastful band?</l>
        <l n="18">And fate to numbers, by a single hand?</l>
        <l n="19">Full through his throat Ulysses' weapon pass'd,</l>
        <l n="20">And pierced his neck. He falls, and breathes his last.</l>
        <l n="21">The tumbling goblet the wide floor o'erflows,</l>
        <l n="22">A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose;</l>
        <l n="23">Grim in convulsive agonies he sprawls:</l>
        <l n="24">Before him spurn'd the loaded table falls,</l>
        <l n="25">And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood</l>
        <l n="26">Of floating meats, and wine, and human blood.</l>
        <l n="27">Amaz'd, confounded, as they saw him fall,</l>
        <l n="28">Up rose the throngs tumultuous round the hall:</l>
        <l n="29">O'er all the dome they cast a haggard eye,</l>
        <l n="30">Each look'd for arms: in vain; no arms were nigh:</l>
        <l n="31">"Aim'st thou at princes?" (all amaz'd they said ;)</l>
        <l n="32">"Thy last of games unhappy hast thou play'd;</l>
        <l n="33">Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed,</l>
        <l n="34">And death, unlucky guest, attends thy deed.</l>
        <l n="35">Vultures shall tear thee." Thus incens'd they spoke,</l>
        <l n="36">While each to chance ascrib'd the wondrous stroke,</l>
        <l n="37">Blind as they were; for death even now invades</l>
        <l n="38">His destin'd prey, and wraps them all in shades.</l>
        <l n="39">Then, grimly frowning, with a dreadful look,</l>
        <l n="40">That wither'd all their hearts, Ulysses spoke:</l>
        <l n="41">"Dogs, ye have had your day! ye fear'd no more</l>
        <l n="42">Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore;</l>
        <pb n="348"/>
        <l n="43">While, to your lust and spoil a guardless prey,</l>
        <l n="44">Our house, our wealth, our helpless handmaids lay:</l>
        <l n="45">Not so content, with bolder frenzy fir'd,</l>
        <l n="46">Even to our bed presumptuous you aspir'd:</l>
        <l n="47">Laws or divine or human fail'd to move,</l>
        <l n="48">Or shame of men, or dread of gods above;</l>
        <l n="49">Heedless alike of infamy or praise,</l>
        <l n="50">Or Fame's eternal voice in future days,</l>
        <l n="51">The hour of vengeance, wretches, now is come;</l>
        <l n="52">Impending fate is yours, and instant doom."</l>
        <l n="53">Thus dreadful he. Confus'd the suitors stood;</l>
        <l n="54">From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood:</l>
        <l n="55">Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide;</l>
        <l n="56">Alone the bold Eurymachus replied:</l>
        <l n="57">"If, as thy words import," (he thus began,)</l>
        <l n="58">"Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man,</l>
        <l n="59">Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain'd</l>
        <l n="60">In thy spoil'd palace, and exhausted land;</l>
        <l n="61">The cause and author of those guilty deeds,</l>
        <l n="62">Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinoüs bleeds.</l>
        <l n="63">Not love, but wild ambition was his guide;</l>
        <l n="64">To slay thy son, thy kingdoms to divide,</l>
        <l n="65">These were his aims; but juster Jove denied.</l>
        <l n="66">Since cold in death th' offender lies, oh spare</l>
        <l n="67">Thy suppliant people, and receive their prayer!</l>
        <l n="68">Brass, gold, and treasures, shall the spoil defray,</l>
        <l n="69">Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay,</l>
        <l n="70">The waste of years refunded in a day.</l>
        <l n="71">Till then thy wrath is just." Ulysses burn'd</l>
        <l n="72">With high disdain, and sternly thus return'd:</l>
        <l n="73">"All, all the treasures that enrich'd our throne</l>
        <l n="74">Before your rapines, join'd with all your own,</l>
        <l n="75">If offer'd, vainly should for mercy call;</l>
        <l n="76">'Tis you that offer, and I scorn them all:</l>
        <l n="77">Your blood is my demand, your lives the prize,</l>
        <l n="78">Till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies.</l>
        <l n="79">Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly;</l>
        <l n="80">This choice is left you to resist or die;</l>
        <l n="81">And die I trust ye shall." He sternly spoke:</l>
        <l n="82">With guilty fears the pale assembly shook.</l>
        <pb n="349"/>
        <l n="83">Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train:</l>
        <l n="84">"Yon archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain;</l>
        <l n="85">But from the threshold shall his darts be sped,</l>
        <l n="86">(Whoe'er he be,) till every prince lie dead?</l>
        <l n="87">Be mindful of yourselves, draw forth your swords,</l>
        <l n="88">And to his shafts obtend these ample boards;</l>
        <l n="89">(So need compels.) Then, all united strive</l>
        <l n="90">The bold invader from his post to drive;</l>
        <l n="91">The city rous'd shall to our rescue haste,</l>
        <l n="92">And this mad archer soon have shot his last."</l>
        <l n="93">Swift as he spoke, he drew his traitor sword,</l>
        <l n="94">And like a lion rush'd against his lord:</l>
        <l n="95">The wary chief the rushing foe repress'd,</l>
        <l n="96">Who met the point and forced it in his breast:</l>
        <l n="97">His falling hand deserts the lifted sword,</l>
        <l n="98">And prone he falls extended o'er the board!</l>
        <l n="99">Before him wide, in mix'd effusion, roll</l>
        <l n="100">Th' untasted viands, and the jovial bowl.</l>
        <l n="101">Full through his liver pass'd the mortal wound,</l>
        <l n="102">With dying rage his forehead beats the ground;</l>
        <l n="103">He spurn'd the seat with fury as he fell,</l>
        <l n="104">And the fierce soul to darkness div'd, and hell.</l>
        <l n="105">Next bold Amphinomus his arms extends</l>
        <l n="106">To force the pass; the godlike man defends.</l>
        <l n="107">Thy spear, Telemachus, prevents th' attack;</l>
        <l n="108">The brazen weapon, driving through his back,</l>
        <l n="109">Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore;</l>
        <l n="110">Flat falls he thundering on the marble floor,</l>
        <l n="111">And his crush'd forehead marks the stone with gore.</l>
        <l n="112">He left his javelin in the dead, for fear</l>
        <l n="113">The long encumbrance of the weighty spear</l>
        <l n="114">To the fierce foe advantage might afford,</l>
        <l n="115">To rush between, and use the shorten'd sword.</l>
        <l n="116">With speedy ardour to his sire he flies,</l>
        <l n="117">And, "Arm, great father! arm:" (in haste he cries:)</l>
        <l n="118">"Lo hence I run for other arms to wield,</l>
        <l n="119">For missive javelins, and for helm and shield;</l>
        <l n="120">Fast by our side, let either faithful swain</l>
        <l n="121">In arms attend us, and their part sustain."</l>
        <pb n="350"/>
        <l n="122">"Haste, and return," (Ulysses made reply,)</l>
        <l n="123">"While yet th' auxiliar shafts this hand supply;</l>
        <l n="124">Lest thou alone, encounter'd by an host,</l>
        <l n="125">Driven from the gate, th' important pass be lost."</l>
        <l n="126">With speed Telemachus obeys, and flies</l>
        <l n="127">Where piled in heaps the royal armour lies;</l>
        <l n="128">Four brazen helmets, eight refulgent spears,</l>
        <l n="129">And four broad bucklers to his sire he bears:</l>
        <l n="130">At once in brazen panoply they shone,</l>
        <l n="131">At once each servant braced his armour on;</l>
        <l n="132">Around their king a faithful guard they stand,</l>
        <l n="133">While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand:</l>
        <l n="134">Chief after chief expir'd at every wound,</l>
        <l n="135">And swell'd the bleeding mountain on the ground.</l>
        <l n="136">Soon as his store of flying fates was spent,</l>
        <l n="137">Against the wall he set the bow unbent;</l>
        <l n="138">And now his shoulders bear the massy shield,</l>
        <l n="139">And now his hands two beamy javelins wield:</l>
        <l n="140">He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play'd</l>
        <l n="141">O'er the high crest, and cast a dreadful shade.</l>
        <l n="142">There stood a window near, whence, looking down</l>
        <l n="143">From o'er the porch, appear'd the subject town.</l>
        <l n="144">A double strength of valves secured the place,</l>

        <l n="149">To mount yon window, and alarm from thence</l>
        <l n="150">The neighbour-town? the town shall force the door,</l>
        <l n="151">And this bold archer soon shall shoot no more."</l>
        <l n="152">Melanthius then: "That outlet to the gate</l>
        <l n="153">So near adjoins that one may guard the strait.</l>
        <l n="154">But other methods of defence remain;</l>
        <l n="155">Myself with arms can furnish all the train;</l>
        <l n="156">Stores from the royal magazine I bring,</l>
        <l n="157">And their own darts shall pierce the prince and king."</l>
        <l n="158">He said: and mounting up the lofty stairs,</l>
        <l n="159">Twelve shields, twelve lances, and twelve helmets bears:</l>
        <l n="160">All arm, and sudden round the hall appears</l>
        <l n="161">A blaze of bucklers, and a wood of spears.</l>
        <pb n="351"/>
        <l n="162">The hero stands oppress'd with mighty woe,</l>
        <l n="163">On every side he sees the labour grow:</l>
        <l n="164">"Oh curs'd event! and oh unlook'd-for aid!</l>
        <l n="165">Melanthius or the women have betray'd—</l>
        <l n="166">Oh my dear son!"—The father with a sigh</l>
        <l n="167">Then ceas'd; the filial virtue made reply:</l>
        <l n="168">"Falsehood is folly, and 'tis just to own</l>

        <l n="170">My haste neglected yonder door to bar,</l>

        <l n="172">Run, good Eumæus, then, and (what before</l>

        <l n="174">Learn, if by female fraud this deed were done,</l>

        <l n="176">While yet they spoke, in quest of arms again</l>
        <l n="177">To the high chamber stole the faithless swain,</l>
        <l n="178">Not unobserv'd. Eumæus watchful ey'd,</l>
        <l n="179">And thus address'd Ulysses near his side:</l>
        <l n="180">"The miscreant we suspected takes that way,</l>

        <l n="188">Go you, and seize the felon; backward bind</l>

        <l n="193">The ready swains obey'd with joyful haste;</l>

        <l n="203">Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew</l>
        <l n="204">And down reluctant on the pavement threw.</l>
        <l n="205">Active and pleas'd the zealous swains fulfil</l>
        <l n="206">At every point their master's rigid will:</l>
        <l n="207">First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound,</l>
        <l n="208">Then straiten'd cords involv'd his body round;</l>
        <l n="209">So drawn aloft, athwart the column tied,</l>
        <l n="210">The howling felon swung from side to side.</l>
        <l n="211">Eumæus scoffing then with keen disdain:</l>
        <l n="212">"There pass thy pleasing night, O gentle swain!</l>
        <l n="213">On that soft pillow, from that envied height,</l>
        <l n="214">First may'st thou see the springing dawn of light;</l>
        <l n="215">So timely rise when morning streaks the east,</l>
        <l n="216">To drive thy victims to the suitors' feast."</l>
        <l n="217">This said, they left him, tortur'd as he lay,</l>
        <l n="218">Secured the door, and hasty strode away:</l>
        <l n="219">Each, breathing death, resum'd his dangerous post</l>
        <l n="220">Near great Ulysses; four against an host.</l>
        <l n="221">When lo! descending to her hero's aid,</l>

        <l n="223">In Mentor's friendly form she join'd his side:</l>
        <l n="224">Ulysses saw, and thus with transport cried:</l>

        <l n="233">The adverse host the phantom-warrior ey'd,</l>

        <l n="243">Thus, and thus only, shalt thou join thy friend."</l>
        <l n="244">His barbarous insult even the goddess fires,</l>
        <l n="245">Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires:</l>
        <l n="246">"Art thou Ulysses? where then shall we find</l>
        <l n="247">The patient body and the constant mind?</l>
        <l n="248">That courage, once the Trojans' daily dread,</l>
        <l n="249">Known nine long years, and felt by heroes dead?</l>
        <l n="250">And where that conduct, which revenged the lust</l>
        <l n="251">Of Priam's race, and laid proud Troy in dust?</l>
        <l n="252">If this, when Helen was the cause, were done;</l>
        <l n="253">What for thy country now, thy queen, thy son?</l>
        <l n="254">Rise then in combat, at my side attend;</l>
        <l n="255">Observe what vigour gratitude can lend,</l>
        <l n="256">And foes how weak, oppos'd against a friend!"</l>
        <l n="257">She spoke; but willing longer to survey</l>
        <l n="258">The sire and son's great acts, withheld the day;</l>
        <l n="259">By farther toils decreed the brave to try,</l>
        <l n="260">And level pois'd the wings of victory;</l>
        <l n="261">Then with a change of form eludes their sight,</l>

        <l n="264">Damastor's son, bold Agelaüs, leads</l>
        <l n="265">The guilty war, Eurynomus succeeds;</l>
        <l n="266">With these Pisander, great Polyctor's son,</l>
        <l n="267">Sage Polybus, and stern Amphimedon,</l>
        <l n="268">With Demoptolemus: these six survive;</l>
        <l n="269">The best of all the shafts had left alive.</l>
        <l n="270">Amidst the carnage, desperate as they stand,</l>
        <l n="271">Thus Agelaüs rous'd the lagging band:</l>
        <l n="272">"The hour is come, when yon fierce man no more</l>

        <l n="274">Lo! Mentor leaves him with an empty boast;</l>
        <l n="275">The four remain, but four against an host.</l>
        <l n="276">Let each at once discharge the deadly dart,</l>
        <l n="277">One sure of six shall reach Ulysses' heart;</l>
        <l n="278">Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain:</l>
        <l n="279">The rest must perish, their great leader slain."</l>
        <pb n="354"/>
        <l n="280">Then all at once their mingled lances threw,</l>
        <l n="281">And thirsty all of one man's blood they flew;</l>
        <l n="282">In vain! Minerva turn'd them with her breath,</l>
        <l n="283">And scatter'd short, or wide, the points of death!</l>
        <l n="284">With deaden'd sound one on the threshold falls,</l>
        <l n="285">One strikes the gate, one rings against the walls:</l>
        <l n="286">The storm pass'd innocent. The godlike man</l>
        <l n="287">Now loftier trod, and dreadful thus began:</l>

        <l n="290">That impious race to all their past misdeeds</l>
        <l n="291">Would add our blood. Injustice still proceeds."</l>
        <l n="292">He spoke: at once their fiery lances flew:</l>
        <l n="293">Great Demoptolemus Ulysses slew;</l>
        <l n="294">Euryades receiv'd the prince's dart;</l>

        <l n="296">Fierce Elatus, by thine, Eumæus, falls;</l>
        <l n="297">Their fall in thunder echoes round the walls.</l>
        <l n="298">The rest retreat: the victors now advance,</l>

        <l n="300">Again the foe discharge the steely shower;</l>
        <l n="301">Again made frustrate by the virgin-power.</l>
        <l n="302">Some, turn'd by Pallas, on the threshold fall,</l>

        <l n="306">Then bold Amphimedon his javelin cast;</l>

        <l n="413">Live, an example for the world to read,</l>
        <l n="414">How much more safe the good than evil deed:</l>
        <l n="415">Thou, with the heaven-taught bard, in peace resort</l>
        <l n="416">From blood and carnage to yon open court:</l>
        <l n="417">Me other work requires."—With timorous awe</l>
        <l n="418">From the dire scene th' exempted two withdraw,</l>
        <l n="419">Scarce sure of life, look round, and trembling move</l>
        <l n="420">To the bright altars of Protector Jove.</l>
        <pb n="358"/>
        <l n="421">Meanwhile Ulysses search'd the dome, to find</l>
        <l n="422">If yet there live of all th' offending kind.</l>
        <l n="423">Not one! complete the bloody tale he found,</l>
        <l n="424">All steep'd in blood, all gasping on the ground.</l>
        <l n="425">So, when by hollow shores the fisher-train</l>
        <l n="426">Sweep with their arching nets the hoary main,</l>
        <l n="427">And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain,</l>
        <l n="428">All naked of their element, and bare,</l>
        <l n="429">The fishes pant, and gasp in thinner air;</l>
        <l n="430">Wide o'er the sands are spread the stiffening prey,</l>
        <l n="431">Till the warm sun exhales their soul away.</l>
        <l n="432">And now the king commands his son to call</l>
        <l n="433">Old Euryclea to the deathful hall:</l>
        <l n="434">The son observant not a moment stays;</l>
        <l n="435">The aged governess with speed obeys;</l>
        <l n="436">The sounding portals instant they display;</l>
        <l n="437">The matron moves, the prince directs the way.</l>
        <l n="438">On heaps of death the stern Ulysses stood,</l>
        <l n="439">All black with dust, and cover'd thick with blood.</l>
        <l n="440">So the grim lion from the slaughter comes,</l>
        <l n="441">Dreadful he glares, and terribly he foams,</l>
        <l n="442">His breast with marks of carnage painted o'er,</l>
        <l n="443">His jaws all dropping with the bull's black gore.</l>
        <l n="444">Soon as her eyes the welcome object met,</l>
        <l n="445">The guilty fall'n, the mighty deed complete;</l>
        <l n="446">A scream of joy her feeble voice essay'd:</l>
        <l n="447">The hero check'd her, and compos'dly said:</l>
        <l n="448">"Woman, experienc'd as thou art, control</l>
        <l n="449">Indecent joy, and feast thy secret soul.</l>
        <l n="450">T' insult the dead is cruel and unjust;</l>
        <l n="451">Fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust.</l>
        <l n="452">Nor heeded these the censure of mankind,</l>
        <l n="453">The good and bad were equal in their mind.</l>
        <l n="454">Justly the price of worthlessness they paid,</l>
        <l n="455">And each now wails an unlamented shade.</l>
        <l n="456">But thou sincere! O Euryclea, say,</l>
        <l n="457">What maids dishonour us, and what obey?"</l>
        <l n="458">Then she: "In these thy kingly walls remain</l>
        <l n="459">(My son) full fifty of the handmaid train,</l>
        <l n="460">Taught, by my care, to cull the fleece or weave,</l>

        <l n="466">Hence to the upper chambers let me fly,</l>

        <pb n="359"/>
        <l n="468">There wake her with the news"—the matron cried.</l>
        <l n="469">"Not so," (Ulysses, more sedate, replied,)</l>
        <l n="470">"Bring first the crew who wrought these guilty deeds."</l>
        <l n="471">In haste the matron parts; the king proceeds.</l>
        <l n="472">"Now to dispose the dead, the care remains</l>
        <l n="473">To you, my son, and you, my faithful swains;</l>
        <l n="474">Th' offending females to that task we doom,</l>
        <l n="475">To wash, to scent, and purify the room:</l>
        <l n="476">These (every table cleans'd, and every throne,</l>
        <l n="477">And all the melancholy labour done,)</l>
        <l n="478">Drive to yon court, without the palace-wall,</l>
        <l n="479">There the revenging sword shall smite them all;</l>
        <l n="480">So with the suitors let them mix in dust,</l>
        <l n="481">Stretch'd in a long oblivion of their lust."</l>
        <l n="482">He said: the lamentable train appear,</l>
        <l n="483">Each vents a groan, and drops a tender tear:</l>
        <l n="484">Each heav'd her mournful burden, and beneath</l>
        <l n="485">The porch depos'd the ghastly heap of death.</l>
        <l n="486">The chief severe, compelling each to move,</l>
        <l n="487">Urged the dire task imperious from above:</l>
        <l n="488">With thirsty sponge they rub the tables o'er;</l>
        <l n="489">(The swains unite their toil;) the walls, the floor,</l>
        <l n="490">Wash'd with th' effusive wave, are purged of gore.</l>
        <l n="491">Once more the palace set in fair array,</l>
        <l n="492">To the base court the females take their way:</l>
        <l n="493">There compass'd close between the dome and wall,</l>
        <l n="494">(Their life's last scene,) they trembling wait their fall.</l>
        <l n="495">Then thus the prince: "To these shall we afford</l>
        <l n="496">A fate so pure, as by the martial sword?</l>
        <l n="497">To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame,</l>
        <l n="498">And base revilers of our house and name?"</l>
        <l n="499">Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung</l>
        <l n="500">A ship's tough cable, from a column hung;</l>
        <l n="501">Near the high top he strain'd it strongly round,</l>
        <l n="502">Whence no contending foot could reach the ground.</l>
        <l n="503">Their heads above connected in a row,</l>
        <l n="504">They beat the air with quivering feet below:</l>
        <l n="505">Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare,</l>
        <l n="506">The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air.</l>
        <pb n="360"/>
        <l n="507">Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind</l>
        <l n="508">The empty corse to waver with the wind.</l>
        <l n="509">Then forth they led Melanthius, and began</l>
        <l n="510">Their bloody work; they lopp'd away the man,</l>
        <l n="511">Morsel for dogs! then trimm'd with brazen shears</l>
        <l n="512">The wretch, and shorten'd of his nose and ears;</l>
        <l n="513">His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel:</l>
        <l n="514">He roar'd, and torments gave his soul to hell.</l>
        <l n="515">They wash, and to Ulysses take their way,</l>
        <l n="516">So ends the bloody business of the day.</l>
        <l n="517">To Euryclea then address'd the king:</l>
        <l n="518">"Bring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring,</l>
        <l n="519">To purge the palace: then the queen attend,</l>
        <l n="520">And let her with her matron-train descend;</l>
        <l n="521">The matron-train, with all the virgin-band,</l>
        <l n="522">Assemble here, to learn their lord's command."</l>
        <l n="523">Then Euryclea: "Joyful I obey,</l>
        <l n="524">But cast those mean dishonest rags away;</l>
        <l n="525">Permit me first the royal robes to bring:</l>
        <l n="526">Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king."</l>
        <l n="527">"Bring sulphur straight, and fire,"<ref n="360.1">1</ref> (the monarch cries.)</l>
        <l n="528">She hears, and at the word obedient flies.</l>
        <l n="529">With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes,</l>
        <l n="530">He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms.</l>
        <l n="531">Again the matron springs with eager pace,</l>
        <l n="532">And spreads her lord's return from place to place.</l>
        <l n="533">They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand,</l>
        <l n="534">A gazing throng, a torch in every hand.<ref n="360.2">2</ref></l>
        <l n="535">They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace</l>
        <l n="536">Each humbly kiss'd his knee, or hand, or face;</l>
        <l n="537">He knows them all; in all such truth appears,</l>
        <l n="538">Even he indulges the sweet joy of tears.</l>
        <note n="346.2">We are now come to the great event or catastrophe of the Odyssey, which is the destruction of the suitors. The manner in which the poet conducts it, has been censured by some as incredible: it has been asked, "Why did not the suitors rush upon Ulysses in a body?" To do so was impossible, because Ulysses shot from the threshold, as Cocles on a narrow bridge stood against the whole army of Porsena. Homer might easily have raised an army, and placed Ulysses at the head of it; but the more difficult way being most conducive to his honour, he rejects all easy methods, shows him struggling with infinite hazards, out of which he extricates himself personally by his wisdom and courage. By these means he completes the character of his hero, leaves a noble image of his worth upon the minds of the spectators, and makes him go off the stage with the utmost applause. Pope.</note>

        <argument>
          <p>Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses' return and the death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but supposes some god has punished them, and descends from her apartments in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied. Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the queen continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinced, and falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other all that has passed during their long separation. The next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to visit his father.</p>
        </argument>
        <l n="1">THEN to the queen, as in repose she lay,</l>
        <l n="2">The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way:</l>
        <l n="3">The transports of her faithful heart supply</l>
        <l n="4">A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly.</l>
        <l n="5">"And sleeps my child?" (the reverend matron cries,)</l>
        <l n="6">"Ulysses lives! arise, my child, arise!</l>
        <l n="7">At length appears the long-expected hour!</l>
        <l n="8">Ulysses comes! the suitors are no more!</l>
        <l n="9">No more they view the golden light of day!</l>
        <l n="10">Arise, and bless thee with the glad survey!"</l>
        <l n="11">Touch'd at her words the mournful queen rejoin'd:</l>
        <l n="12">"Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?</l>
        <l n="13">The righteous powers, who tread the starry skies,</l>
        <l n="14">The weak enlighten, and confound the wise,</l>
        <l n="15">And human thought, with unresisted sway,</l>
        <l n="16">Depress or raise, enlarge or take away:</l>
        <l n="17">Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes,</l>
        <l n="18">And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks.</l>
        <l n="19">Unkind, the fond illusion to impose!</l>
        <l n="20">Was it to flatter or deride my woes?</l>
        <l n="21">Never did I a sleep so sweet enjoy,</l>
        <l n="22">Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy.</l>
        <l n="23">Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore,</l>
        <l n="24">O Troy?—may never tongue pronounce thee more!</l>
        <pb n="362"/>
        <l n="25">Begone! another might have felt our rage,</l>
        <l n="26">But age is sacred, and we spare thy age."</l>
        <l n="27">To whom with warmth: "My soul a lie disdains:</l>
        <l n="28">Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns:</l>
        <l n="29">That stranger, patient of the suitors' wrongs,</l>
        <l n="30">And the rude license of ungovern'd tongues,</l>
        <l n="31">He, he is thine. Thy son his latent guest</l>
        <l n="32">Long knew, but lock'd the secret in his breast;</l>
        <l n="33">With well-concerted art to end his woes,</l>
        <l n="34">And burst at once in vengeance on the foes."</l>
        <l n="35">While yet she spoke, the queen in transport sprung</l>
        <l n="36">Swift from the couch, and round the matron hung;</l>
        <l n="37">Fast from her eye descends the rolling tear:</l>
        <l n="38">"Say, once more say, is my Ulysses here?</l>
        <l n="39">How could that numerous and outrageous band</l>
        <l n="40">By one be slain, though by a hero's hand?"</l>
        <l n="41">"I saw it not," (she cries,) "but heard alone,</l>
        <l n="42">When death was busy, a loud dying groan;</l>
        <l n="43">The damsel-train turn'd pale at every wound,</l>
        <l n="44">Immur'd we sate, and catch'd each passing sound;</l>
        <l n="45">When death had seiz'd her prey, thy son attends,</l>
        <l n="46">And at his nod the damsel-train descends:</l>
        <l n="47">There terrible in arms Ulysses stood,</l>
        <l n="48">And the dead suitors almost swam in blood:</l>
        <l n="49">Thy heart had leap'd the hero to survey,</l>

        <l n="52">The dome he purges, now the flame aspires:</l>
        <l n="53">Heap'd lie the dead without the palace walls;</l>
        <l n="54">Haste, daughter, haste, thy own Ulysses calls!</l>
        <l n="55">Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow;</l>
        <l n="56">Enjoy the present good, and former woe.</l>
        <l n="57">Ulysses lives, his vanquish'd foes to see;</l>
        <l n="58">He lives to thy Telemachus and thee!"</l>
        <l n="59">"Ah, no!" (with sighs Penelope rejoin'd,)</l>
        <l n="60">"Excess of joy disturbs thy wandering mind;</l>
        <l n="61">How blest this happy hour, should he appear,</l>
        <l n="62">Dear to us all, to me supremely dear!</l>
        <l n="63">Ah, no! some god the suitors' deaths decreed,</l>
        <l n="64">Some god descends, and by his hand they bleed;</l>
        <pb n="363"/>
        <l n="65">Blind! to contemn the stranger's righteous cause,</l>
        <l n="66">And violate all hospitable laws!</l>
        <l n="67">The good they hated, and the powers defied;</l>
        <l n="68">But heaven is just, and by a god they died.</l>
        <l n="69">For never must Ulysses view this shore;</l>
        <l n="70">Never! the loved Ulysses is no more!"</l>
        <l n="71">"What words" (the matron cries) "have reach'd my ears?</l>
        <l n="72">Doubt we his presence, when he now appears?</l>
        <l n="73">Then hear conviction: Ere the fatal day</l>
        <l n="74">That forced Ulysses o'er the watery way,</l>
        <l n="75">A boar, fierce rushing in the sylvan war,</l>
        <l n="76">Plough'd half his thigh; I saw, I saw the scar,</l>
        <l n="77">And wild with transport had reveal'd the wound;</l>
        <l n="78">But, ere I spoke, he rose and check'd the sound.</l>
        <l n="79">Then, daughter, haste away, and if a lie</l>
        <l n="80">Flow from this tongue, then let thy servant die!"</l>
        <l n="81">To whom with dubious joy the queen replies:</l>
        <l n="82">"Wise is thy soul, but errors seize the wise;</l>
        <l n="83">The works of gods what mortal can survey?</l>
        <l n="84">Who knows their motives, who shall trace their way?</l>
        <l n="85">But learn we instant how the suitors trod</l>
        <l n="86">The paths of death, by man or by a god."</l>
        <l n="87">Thus speaks the queen, and no reply attends,</l>
        <l n="88">But with alternate joy and fear descends;</l>
        <l n="89">At every step debates, her lord to prove,</l>
        <l n="90">Or, rushing to his arms, confess her love!</l>
        <l n="91">Then, gliding through the marble valves, in state,</l>
        <l n="92">Oppos'd before the shining fire she sate.</l>
        <l n="93">The monarch, by a column high enthron'd,</l>
        <l n="94">His eye withdrew, and fix'd it on the ground;</l>
        <l n="95">Curious to hear his queen the silence break:</l>
        <l n="96">Amaz'd she sate, and impotent to speak;</l>
        <l n="97">O'er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain,</l>
        <l n="98">Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again.</l>
        <l n="99">At length Telemachus: "Oh, who can find</l>
        <l n="100">A woman like Penelope unkind?</l>
        <l n="101">Why thus in silence? why, with winning charms</l>
        <l n="102">Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms?</l>
        <l n="103">Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows,</l>
        <l n="104">When twice ten years are pass'd of mighty woes:</l>
        <pb n="364"/>
        <l n="105">To softness lost, to spousal love unknown,</l>

        <l n="107">"O my Telemachus!" (the queen rejoin'd,)</l>
        <l n="108">"Distracting fears confound my labouring mind;</l>
        <l n="109">Powerless to speak, I scarce uplift my eyes,</l>

        <l n="111">Oh deign he, if Ulysses, to remove</l>
        <l n="112">These boding thoughts, and what he is, to prove!"</l>
        <l n="113">Pleas'd with her virtuous fears, the king replies:</l>

        <l n="115">Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring:</l>
        <l n="116">This garb of poverty belies the king;</l>
        <l n="117">No more. This day our deepest care requires,</l>

        <l n="119">If one man's blood, though mean, distain our hands,</l>
        <l n="120">The homicide retreats to foreign lands;</l>
        <l n="121">By us, in heaps th' illustrious peerage falls,</l>
        <l n="122">Th' important deed our whole attention calls."<ref n="364.1">1</ref></l>
        <l n="123">"Be that thy care," (Telemachus replies ;)</l>
        <l n="124">"The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise;</l>
        <l n="125">For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey;</l>
        <l n="126">And dauntless follow where you lead the way;</l>
        <l n="127">Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find</l>
        <l n="128">Thy coward son degenerate lag behind."</l>
        <l n="129">"Then instant to the bath," (the monarch cries,)</l>
        <l n="130">"Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise,</l>
        <l n="131">Thence all descend in pomp and proud array,</l>

        <pb n="365"/>
        <l n="139">Thus spoke the king: th' observant train obey;</l>
        <l n="140">At once they bathe, and dress in proud array:</l>
        <l n="141">The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance</l>
        <l n="142">And fair-zon'd damsels form the sprightly dance.</l>
        <l n="143">The voice, attun'd to instrumental sounds,</l>
        <l n="144">Ascends the roof, the vaulted roof rebounds;</l>
        <l n="145">Not unobserv'd: the Greeks eluded say,</l>

        <l n="147">Inconstant! to admit the bridal hour."</l>
        <l n="148">Thus they—but nobly chaste she weds no more.</l>
        <l n="149">Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends;</l>
        <l n="150">With faithful cares Eurynomé attends,</l>
        <l n="151">O'er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds;</l>
        <l n="152">Then, dress'd in pomp, magnificent he treads.</l>
        <l n="153">The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine</l>
        <l n="154">With majesty enlarged, and grace divine.</l>
        <l n="155">Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly</l>
        <l n="156">His thick large locks, of hyacinthine dye.</l>
        <l n="157">As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives</l>
        <l n="158">His heavenly skill, a breathing image lives;</l>
        <l n="159">By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,</l>
        <l n="160">And the pale silver glows with fusile gold:</l>
        <l n="161">So Pallas his heroic form improves</l>
        <l n="162">With bloom divine, and like a god he moves!</l>
        <l n="163">More high he treads, and, issuing forth in state,</l>
        <l n="164">Radiant before his gazing consort sate.</l>
        <l n="165">And, "O my queen!" (he cries,) "what power above</l>
        <l n="166">Has steel'd that heart, averse to spousal love?</l>
        <l n="167">Canst thou, Penelope, when Heaven restores</l>
        <l n="168">Thy lost Ulysses to his native shores,</l>

        <l n="177">And now, even now, it melts! for sure I see</l>

        <l n="186">Th' enormous burden, who but Heaven above?</l>
        <l n="187">It mocks the weak attempts of human hands;</l>
        <l n="188">But the whole earth must move, if Heaven commands.</l>
        <l n="189">Then hear sure evidence, while we display</l>
        <l n="190">Words seal'd with sacred truth, and truth obey:</l>
        <l n="191">This hand the wonder fram'd; an olive spread</l>
        <l n="192">Full in the court its ever-verdant head;</l>
        <l n="193">Vast as some mighty column's bulk, on high</l>
        <l n="194">The huge trunk rose, and heav'd into the sky;</l>
        <l n="195">Around the tree I rais'd a nuptial bower,</l>
        <l n="196">And roof'd defensive of the storm and shower;</l>
        <l n="197">The spacious valve, with art inwrought, conjoins;</l>
        <l n="198">And the fair dome with polish'd marble shines.</l>
        <l n="199">I lopp'd the branchy head; aloft in twain</l>
        <l n="200">Sever'd the bole, and smooth'd the shining grain;</l>
        <l n="201">Then posts, capacious of the frame, I raise,</l>
        <l n="202">And bore it, regular, from space to space:</l>
        <l n="203">Athwart the frame, at equal distance lie</l>
        <l n="204">Thongs of tough hides, that boast a purple dye;</l>
        <l n="205">Then, polishing the whole, the finish'd mould</l>
        <l n="206">With silver shone, with elephant and gold.</l>
        <l n="207">But if o'erturn'd by rude, ungovern'd hands,</l>
        <l n="208">Or still inviolate the olive stands,</l>
        <l n="209">'Tis thine, O queen, to say; and now impart,</l>

        <l n="213">At length recovering, to his arms she flew,</l>

        <pb n="367"/>
        <l n="215">The tears pour'd down amain: and "O" (she cries)</l>

        <l n="226">Pour out my soul, and die within thine arms!</l>
        <l n="227">I dreaded fraud! Men, faithless men, betray</l>
        <l n="228">Our easy faith, and make the sex their prey:</l>
        <l n="229">Against the fondness of my heart I strove;</l>
        <l n="230">'Twas caution, O my lord! not want of love.</l>
        <l n="231">Like me had Helen fear'd, with wanton charms</l>
        <l n="232">Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms;</l>

        <l n="234">Thus had she fear'd, she had not gone astray.</l>
        <l n="235">But Heaven, averse to Greece, in wrath decreed</l>
        <l n="236">That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed:</l>
        <l n="237">Blind to the ills that from injustice flow,</l>
        <l n="238">She coloured all our wretched lives with woe.</l>

        <l n="247">Touch'd to the soul, the king with rapture hears,</l>
        <l n="248">Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears.</l>
        <l n="249">As to the shipwreck'd mariner, the shores</l>

        <argument>
          <p>The souls of the suitors are conducted by Mercury to the infernal shades. Ulysses in the country goes to the retirement of his father Laërtes; he finds him busied in his garden all alone: the manner of his discovery to him is beautifully described. They return together to his lodge, and the king is acknowledged by Dolius and the servants. The Ithacensians, led by Eupithes, the father of Antinoüs, rise against Ulysses, who gives them battle, in which Eupithes is killed by Laërtes: and the goddess Pallas makes a lasting peace between Ulysses and his subjects which concludes the Odyssey.</p>

        <l n="615">From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare."</l>
        <l n="616">Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine</l>

        <p>I CANNOT dismiss this work without a few observations on the true character and style of it. Whoever reads the Odyssey with an eye to the Iliad, expecting to find it of the same character, or of the same sort of spirit, will be grievously deceived, and err against the first principle of criticism, which is to consider the nature of the piece, and the intent of its author. The Odyssey is a moral and political work, instructive to all degrees of men, and filled with images, examples, and precepts, of civil and domestic life. Homer is here a person

        The Odyssey is the reverse of the Iliad, in moral, subject, manner, and style; to which it has no sort of relation, but as the story happens to follow in order of time, and as some of the same persons are actors in it. Yet from this incidental connexion many have been misled to regard it as a continuation or second part, and thence to expect a parity of character inconsistent with its nature.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder that the common reader should fall into this mistake, when so great a critic as Longinus seems not wholly free from it; although what he has said has been generally understood to import a severer censure of the Odyssey than it really does, if we consider the occasion on which it is introduced, and the circumstances to which it is confined.</p>
        <p>"The Odyssey," says he, "is an instance, how natural it is to a great genius, when it begins to grow old and decline, to delight itself in narrations and fables. For, that Homer composed the Odyssey after the Iliad, many proofs may be given, &amp;c. From hence in my judgment it proceeds, that as the Iliad was written while his spirit was in its greatest vigour, the whole structure of that work is dramatic and full of action; whereas the greater part of the Odyssey is employed in narration, which is the taste of old age: so that in this latter piece we may compare him to</p>
        <pb n="390"/>
        <p>the setting sun, which has still the same greatness, but not the same ardour or force. He speaks not in the same strain: we see no more that sublime of the Iliad which marches on with a constant pace, without ever being stopped, or retarded: there appears no more that hurry and that strong tide of motions and passions, pouring one after another: there is no more the same fury, or the same volubility of diction, so suitable to action, and all along drawing in such innumerable images of nature. But Homer, like the ocean, is always great, even when he ebbs and retires; even when he is lowest, and loses himself most in narrations and incredible fictions: as instances of this, we cannot forget the descriptions of tempests, the adventures of Ulysses with the Cyclops, and many others. But though all this be age, it is the age of Homer.--And it may be said for the credit of these fictions that they are beautiful dreams, or if you will, the dreams of Jupiter himself. I spoke of the Odyssey only to show, that the greatest poets, when their genius wants strength and warmth for the pathetic, for the most part employ themselves in painting the manners. This Homer has done, in characterizing the suitors, and describing their way of life; which is properly a branch of comedy, whose peculiar business it is to represent the manners of men.'</p>
        <p>We must first observe, it is the sublime of which Longinus is writing: that, and not the nature of Homer's poem, is his subject. After having highly extolled the sublimity and fire of the Iliad, he justly observes the Odyssey to have less of those qualities, and to turn more on the side of moral, and reflections on human life. Nor is it his business here to determine, whether the elevated spirit of the one, or the just moral of the other, be the greater excellence in itself.</p>
        <p>Secondly, that fire and fury of which he is speaking, cannot well be meant of the general spirit and inspiration which is to run through a whole epic poem, but of that particular warmth and impetuosity necessary in some parts, to image or represent actions or passions, of haste, tumult, and violence. It is on occasion of citing some such particular passages in Homer, that Longinus breaks into this reflection; which seems to determine his meaning chiefly to that sense.</p>
        <p>Upon the whole, he affirms the Odyssey to have less sublimity and fire than the Iliad, but he does not say it wants the sublime or wants fire. He affirms it to be narrative, but not that the narration is defective. He affirms it to abound in fictions, not that those fictions are ill invented, or ill executed. He affirms it to be nice and particular in painting the manners, but not that those manners are ill painted. If Homer has fully in these points accomplished his own design, and done all that the nature of his poem demanded or allowed, it still remains perfect in its kind, and as much a master-piece as the Iliad.</p>
        <pb n="391"/>
        <p>The amount of the passage is this; that in his own particular taste, and with respect to the sublime, Longinus preferred the Iliad: and because the Odyssey was less active and lofty, he judged it the work of the old age of Homer.</p>
        <p>If this opinion be true, it will only prove, that Homer's age might determine him in the choice of his subject, not that it affected him in the execution of it and that which would be a very wrong instance to prove the decay of his imagination, is a very good one to evince the strength of his judgment. For had he, as Madam Dacier observes, composed the Odyssey in his youth, and the Iliad in his age, both must in reason have been exactly the same as they now stand. To blame Homer for his choice of such a subject, as did not admit the same incidents and the same pomp of style as his former, is to take offence at too much variety, and to imagine, that when a man has written one good thing, he must ever after only copy himself.</p>
        <p>The Battle of Constantine, and the School of Athens, are both pieces of Raphael: shall we censure the School of Athens as faulty, because it has not the fury and fire of the other? or shall we say, that Raphael was grown grave and old, because he chose to represent the manners of old men and philosophers? There is all the silence, tranquillity, and composure in the one, and all the warmth, hurry, and tumult in the other, which the subject of either required: both of them had been imperfect, if they had not been as they are. And let the painter or poet be young or old, who designs and performs in this manner, it proves him to have made the piece at a time of life when he was master not only of his art, but of his discretion.</p>
        <p>Aristotle makes no such distinction between the two poems: he constantly cites them with equal praise, and draws the rules and examples of epic writing equally from both. But it is rather to the Odyssey that Horace gives the preference, in the Epistle to Lollius, and in the Art of Poetry. It is remarkable how opposite his opinion is to that of Longinus; and that the particulars he chooses to extol, are those very fictions and pictures of the manners, which the other seems least to approve. Those fables and manners are of the very essence of the work: but even without that regard, the fables themselves have both more invention and more instruction, and the manners more moral and example, than those of the Iliad.</p>
        <p>In some points (and those the most essential to the epic poem) the Odyssey is confessed to excel the Iliad; and principally in the great end of it, the moral. The conduct, turn, and disposition of the fable is also what the critics allow to be the better model for epic writers to follow: accordingly we find much more of the cast of this poem than of the other in the Æneid, and (what next to that is perhaps the greatest example) in the Telemachus. In</p>
        <pb n="392"/>
        <p>the manners, it is no way inferior: Longinus is so far from finding any defect in these, that he rather taxes Homer with painting them too minutely. As to the narrations, although they are more numerous as the occasions are more frequent, yet they carry no more the marks of old age, and are neither more prolix nor more circumstantial, than the conversations and dialogues of the Iliad. Not to mention the length of those of Phœnix in the ninth book, and of Nestor in the eleventh (which may be thought in compliance to their characters), those of Glaucus in the sixth, of Æneas in the twentieth, and some others, must be allowed to exceed any in the whole Odyssey. And that the propriety of style, and the numbers, in the narrations of each are equal, will appear to any who compare them.</p>
        <p>To form a right judgment, whether the genius of Homer had suffered any decay, we must consider, in both his poems, such parts as are of a similar nature, and will bear comparison. And it is certain we shall find in each the same vivacity and fecundity of invention, the same life and strength of imaging and colouring, the particular descriptions as highly painted, the figures as bold, the metaphors as animated, and the numbers as harmonious and as various.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey is a perpetual source of poetry: the stream is not the less full for being gentle; though it is true (when we speak only with regard to the Sublime) that a river, foaming and thundering in cataracts from rocks and precipices, is what more strikes, amazes, and fills the mind, than the same body of water, flowing afterwards through peaceful vales and agreeable scenes of pasturage.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey (as I have before said) ought to be considered according to its own nature and design, not with an eye to the Iliad. To censure Homer because it is unlike what it was never meant to resemble, is, as if a gardener who had purposely cultivated two beautiful trees of contrary natures, as a specimen of his skill in the several kinds, should be blamed for not bringing them into pairs; when in root, stem, leaf, and flower, each was so entirely different, that one must have been spoiled in the endeavour to match the other.</p>
        <p>Longinus, who saw this poem was "partly of the nature of comedy," ought not, for that very reason, to have considered it with a view to the Iliad. How little any such resemblance was the intention of Homer, may appear from hence, that although the character of Ulysses there was already drawn, yet here he purposely turns to another side of it, and shows him not in that full light of glory, but in the shade of common life, with a mixture of such qualities as are requisite to all the lowest accidents of it, struggling with misfortunes, and on a level with the meanest of mankind. As for the other persons, none of them are above</p>
        <pb n="393"/>
        <p>what we call the higher comedy: Calypso, though a goddess, is a character of intrigue; the suitors yet more approaching to it; the Phæacians are of the same cast; the Cyclops, Melanthius, and Irus, descend even to droll characters; and the scenes that appear throughout, are generally of the comic kind; banquets, revels, sports, loves, and the pursuit of a woman.</p>
        <p>From the nature of the poem, we shall form an idea of the style. The diction is to follow the images, and to take its colour from the complexion of the thoughts. Accordingly the Odyssey is not always clothed in the majesty of verse proper to tragedy, but sometimes descends into the plainer narrative, and sometimes even to that familiar dialogue essential to comedy. However, where it cannot support a sublimity, it always preserves a dignity, or at least a propriety.</p>
        <p>There is a real beauty in an easy, pure, perspicuous description even of a low action. There are numerous instances of this both in Homer and Virgil; and perhaps those natural passages are not the least pleasing of their works. It is often the same in history, where the representations of common, or even domestic things, in clear, plain, and natural words, are frequently found to make the liveliest impression on the reader.</p>
        <p>The question is, how far a poet, in pursuing the description or image of an action, can attach himself to little circumstances, without vulgarity or trifling? what particulars are proper, and enliven the image; or what are impertinent, and clog it? In this matter painting is to be consulted, and the whole regard had to those circumstances which contribute to form a full, and yet not a confused, idea of a thing.</p>
        <p>Epithets are of vast service to this effect, and the right use of these is often the only expedient to render the narration poetical.</p>
        <p>The great point of judgment is to distinguish when to speak simply, and when figuratively: but whenever the poet is obliged by the nature of his subject to descend to the lower manner of writing, an elevated style would be affected, and therefore ridiculous; and the more he was forced upon figures and metaphors to avoid that lowness, the more the image would be broken, and consequently obscure.</p>
        <p>One may add, that the use of the grand style on little subjects, is not only ludicrous, but a sort of transgression against the rules of proportion and mechanics: it is using a vast force to lift a feather.</p>
        <pb n="394"/>
        <p>I believe, now I am upon this head, it will be found a just observation, that the low actions of life cannot be put into a figurative style without being ridiculous, but things natural can. Metaphors raise the latter into dignity, as we see in the Georgics; but throw the former into ridicule, as in the Lutrin. I think this may very well be accounted for: laughter implies censure; inanimate and irrational beings are not objects of censure: therefore these may be elevated as much as you please, and no ridicule follows: but when rational beings are represented above their real character, it becomes ridiculous in art, because it is vicious in morality. The bees in Virgil, were they rational beings, would be ridiculous by having their actions and manners represented on a level with creatures so superior as men; since it would imply folly or pride, which are the proper objects of ridicule.</p>
        <p>The use of pompous expression for low actions or thoughts is the true sublime of Don Quixote. How far unfit it is for epic poetry, appears in its being the perfection of the mock epic. It is so far from being the sublime of tragedy, that it is the cause of all bombast; when poets, instead of being, as they imagine, constantly lofty, only preserve throughout a painful equality of fustian; that continued swell of language, which runs indiscriminately even through their lowest characters, and rattles like some mightiness of meaning in the most indifferent subjects, is of a piece with that perpetual elevation of tone which the players have learned from it; and which is not speaking, but vociferating.</p>
        <p>There is still more reason for a variation of style in epic poetry than in tragic, to distinguish between that language of the gods proper to the Muse who sings, and is inspired; and that of men who are introduced speaking only according to nature. Farther, there ought to be a difference of style observed in the speeches of human persons, and those of deities; and again, in those which may be called set harangues, or orations, and those which are only conversation or dialogue. Homer has more of the latter than any other poet: what Virgil does by two or three words of narration, Homer still performs by speeches: not only replies, but even rejoinders are frequent in him, a practice almost unknown to Virgil. This renders his poems more animated, but less grave and majestic; and consequently necessitates the frequent use of a lower style. The writers of tragedy lie under the same necessity, if they would copy nature: whereas that painted and poetical diction which they perpetually use, would be improper even in orations designed to move with all the arts of rhetoric; this is plain from the practice of Demosthenes and Cicero; and Virgil in those of Drances and Turnus gives an eminent example, how far removed the style of them ought to be from such an excess of figures and ornaments: which indeed fits only that language of the gods we have been speaking of, or that of a muse under inspiration.</p>
        <p>To read through a whole work in this strain, is like travelling</p>
        <pb n="395"/>
        <p>all along on the ridge of a hill; which is not half so agreeable as sometimes gradually to rise, and sometimes gently to descend, as the way leads, and as the end of the journey directs.</p>
        <p>Indeed the true reason that so few poets have imitated Homer in these lower parts, has been the extreme difficulty of preserving that mixture of ease and dignity essential to them. For it is as hard for an epic poem to stoop to the narrative with success, as for a prince to descend to be familiar, without diminution to his greatness.</p>
        <p>The sublime style is more easily counterfeited than the natural; something that passes for it, or sounds like it, is common to all false writers: but nature, purity, perspicuity, and simplicity, never walk in the clouds; they are obvious to all capacities; and where they are not evident, they do not exist.</p>
        <p>The most plain narration not only admits of these, and of harmony (which are all the qualities of style) but it requires every one of them to render it pleasing. On the contrary, whatever pretends to a share of the sublime, may pass, notwithstanding any defects in the rest; nay sometimes without any of them, and gain the admiration of all ordinary readers.</p>
        <p>Homer, in his lowest narrations or speeches, is ever easy, flowing, copious, clear, and harmonious. He shows not less invention, in assembling the humbler, than the greater, thoughts and images; nor less judgment, in proportioning the style and the versification to these, than to the other. Let it be remembered, that the same genius that soared the highest, and from whom the greatest models of the sublime are derived, was also he who stooped the lowest, and gave to the simple narrative its utmost perfection. Which of these was the harder task to Homer himself, I cannot pretend to determine; but to his translator I can affirm (however unequal all his imitations must be) that of the latter has been much more difficult.</p>
        <p>Whoever expects here the same pomp of verse, and the same ornaments of diction, as in the Iliad, he will, and he ought to be, disappointed. Were the original otherwise, it had been an offence against nature; and were the translation so, it were an offence against Homer, which is the same thing.</p>
        <p>It must be allowed that there is a majesty and harmony in the Greek language which greatly contribute to elevate and support the narration. But I must also observe that this is an advantage grown upon the language since Homer's time; for things are removed from vulgarity by being out of use: and if the words we could find in any present language were equally sonorous or musical in themselves, they would still appear less poetical and uncommon than those of a dead one, from this only circumstance, of being in every man's mouth. I may add to this another disadvantage to a translator, from a different cause: Homer seems</p>
        <pb n="396"/>
        <p>to have taken upon him the character of an historian, antiquary, divine, and professor of arts and sciences, as well as a poet. In one or other of these characters he descends into many particulars, which as a poet only perhaps he would have avoided. All these ought to be preserved by a faithful translator, who in some measure takes the place of Homer; and all that can be expected from him is to make them as poetical as the subject will bear. Many arts, therefore, are requisite to supply these disadvantages, in order to dignify and solemnize these plainer parts, which hardly admit of any poetical ornaments.</p>
        <p>Some use has been made to this end of the style of Milton. A just and moderate mixture of old words may have an effect like the working old abbey stones into a building, which I have sometimes seen to give a kind of venerable air, and yet not destroy the neatness, elegance, and equality requisite to a new work: I mean without rendering it too unfamiliar, or remote from the present purity of writing, or from that ease and smoothness which ought always to accompany narration or dialogue. In reading a style judiciously antiquated, one finds a pleasure not unlike that of travelling on an old Roman way: but then the road must be as good, as the way is ancient; the style must be such in which we may evenly proceed, without being put to short stops by sudden abruptness, or puzzled by frequent turnings and transpositions. No man delights in furrows and stumbling-blocks: and let our love to antiquity be ever so great, a fine ruin is one thing, and a heap of rubbish another. The imitators of Milton, like most other imitators, are not copies but caricatures of their original; they are a hundred times more obselete and cramp than he, and equally so in all places: whereas it should have been observed of Milton, that he is not lavish of his exotic words and phrases every where alike, but employs them much more where the subject is marvellous, vast, and strange, as in the scenes of heaven, hell, chaos, &amp;c., than where it is turned to the natural or agreeable, as in the pictures of paradise, the loves of our first parents, the entertainments of angels, and the like. In general, this unusual style better serves to awaken our ideas in the descriptions and in the imaging and picturesque parts, than it agrees with the lower sort of narrations, the character of which is simplicity and purity. Milton has several of the latter, where we find not an antiquated, affected, or uncouth word, for some hundred lines together; as in his fifth book, the latter part of the eighth, the former of the tenth and eleventh books, and in the narration of Michael in the twelfth. I wonder indeed that he, who ventured (contrary to the practice of all other epic poets) to imitate Homer's lownesses in the narrative, should not also have copied his plainness and perspicuity in the dramatic parts: since in his speeches (where clearness above all is necessary) there is frequently such transposition and forced construction, that the very sense is not to be discovered without a second or third reading: and in this certainly he ought to be no example.</p>
        <pb n="397"/>
        <p>To preserve the true character of Homer's style in the present translation, great pains have been taken to be easy and natural. The chief merit I can pretend to, is, not to have been carried into a more plausible and figurative manner of writing, which would better have pleased all readers, but the judicious ones. My errors had been fewer, had each of those gentlemen who joined with me shown as much of the severity of a friend to me, as I did to them, in a strict animadversion and correction. What assistance I received from them, was made known in general to the public in the original proposals for this work, and the particulars are specified at the conclusion of it; to which I must add (to be punctually just) some part of the tenth and fifteenth books. The reader will now be too good a judge, how much the greater part of it, and consequently of its faults, is chargeable upon me alone. But this I can with integrity affirm, that I have bestowed as much time and pains upon the whole, as were consistent with the indispensable duties and cares of life, and with that wretched state of health which God has been pleased to make my portion. At the least, it is a pleasure to me to reflect, that I have introduced into our language this other work of the greatest and most ancient of poets, with some dignity; and I hope, with as little disadvantage as the Iliad. And if, after the unmerited success of that translation, any one will wonder why I would enterprise the Odyssey; I think it sufficient to say, that Homer himself did the same, or the world would never have seen it.</p>
