      <p>HERALD.</p>
      <p>[SCENE.—The sea-shore: on one side the sea, on the other the gates of Argos. The Thymele is adorned with statues of APOLLO, ARTEMIS, HERMES, and other divinities. Enter from the shore the fifty daughters of Danaos, accompanied by their father they are arrayed in Egyptian costume, and bear in their hands the suppliant bough, wreathed with wool. They form the Chorus, and as they advance twelve of their number chant the following ode.]</p><pb n="402"/>
        
      <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
      <p>THE trilogy to which this drama belonged, like that of which "The Seven against Thebes" formed the concluding member, was founded upon an ancient epic, by an unknown author. Of this poem little is known, except that it contained five thousand five hundred verses, and bore the title of "The Danaides."</p>
      <p>The story which it embodied appealed powerfully to that passion for legendary genealogies which formed such a striking feature of the Grecian character. Alleged descent from a common ancestor was the bond of union between the members of every Grecian community, great or small; and as this legendary personage was usually of divine or semi-divine origin, even the humblest citizen thus felt himself brought into more or less direct filiation with the gods. The divine element thus, according to the popular conception, incarnated in humanity, culminated in the great national hero, Herakles, "the most renowned and ubiquitous of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the Hellenes"—the only mortal who, from a life of toil and suffering on earth, was admitted to the godhead, and received into the society of Olympus. His<pb n="403"/>
        descendants, moreover, the Herakleids, associated with the Dorians in the conquest of the Peloponnesus, were glorified in the popular imagination as the founders of the great Dorian cities of Argos, Sparta, and Messenia, and as the introducers in those localities of a new social order. Peculiar interest thus attaches to Io, the progenitrix of Herakles, and to the birth of her offspring, Epaphos, an event celebrated in such glowing strains by the chorus of Suppliants (v. 580).<ref n="402.1">*</ref></p>
      <p>In thus veiling the grosser features of the Io legend, as popularly conceived, while, at the same time, investing it with a more spiritual meaning, Æschylus appears not only as the great creative poet, but also as the true prophet of his generation. The numerous legends of which the story of Io may be regarded as a typical example embodied, in a vulgar form, the idea that it was only through association with the divine principle that man could rise to his true ideal as man. The poet seizes upon this idea, separates it from the grosser elements of the popular symbol, and extols the benignity of Zeus in thus seeking fellowship with mortals—giving prominence to the idea that through this agency alone the human race was raised to a higher level, physical and moral, than it could otherwise have attained.</p>
      <p>The introductory character of "The Suppliants" has been inferred from the extreme simplicity of the plot, and from other considerations; accordingly, it is<note type="footnote">* I have not alluded to the solar character of the Hellenic legends—a subject upon which so much light has been thrown by Professor Max Müller and Mr. Cox.</note><pb n="404"/>
        now generally regarded as forming the first member of a trilogy of which the succeeding dramas were "The Egyptians," and "The Danaides," both of which have been lost. Though deficient in dramatic interest, this piece is characterized by the remarkable beauty of the choral odes, which, from their sublime simplicity, and from the high conception which they embody of Zeus, as the supreme and omnipotent ruler, remind us occasionally of the Hebrew psalms.</p>
      <p>It must be remembered, moreover, that, at the time of Æschylus, the national legends had not yet lost their hold upon the popular belief, and accordingly mythical events, such as the arrival of the Danaides in Argos, were considered not only as having influenced the subsequent destinies of Greece, but also as having been brought about by the inscrutable counsels of Zeus; the unfolding of whose designs, through the medium of tragedy, was regarded as the highest function of the poet.</p>
      <p>The ancient legend tells of the strife between the sons of Belos; how Danaos was driven from his home by Ægyptos, who usurped his throne; how the latter sought to force the Danaides to marry his sons, and how Athena herself exhorted Danaos to flee with his daughters to the land of Io.</p>
      <p>The introductory drama opens with their arrival, in the character of suppliants, at Argos, and is founded upon the protection accorded to them by the Argives and their king, Pelasgos: the appearance of the Egyptian herald, at the conclusion of the play, toge<pb n="405"/>
        ther with his forcible attempt to carry off the suppliants, prepares the spectator for the arrival of the Egyptian pursuers in the succeeding drama. Attention has been called to the picturesque beauty of the opening scene, where, holding in their hands their wool-wreathed myrtle boughs, and arrayed in white apparel, which formed a striking contrast to their swarthy limbs, the suppliants grouped themselves under the statues of the gods: they would, moreover, be regarded with peculiar interest as wanderers from the valley of the Nile, “the wondrous river fed with snow,” upon whose fountains no human eye had been permitted to gaze.</p>
      <p>Of "The Egyptians," unfortunately, no fragments remain; it doubtless embodied the main incident in the tragic story of the Danaides. It is related in the legend that Danaos was elected king by the Argives, in place of Pelasgos; being unable to cope with Ægyptos and his sons, who still press their suit, he is compelled to yield to their demand, and promises to give his daughters in marriage to their detested suitors. In secret, however, he furnishes each with a dagger, enjoining her, at the same time, to slay her lord during the nuptial night. The terrible deed was executed. Hypermnestra alone, soothed by love, and preferring the reputation of cowardice to that of blood-guiltiness (Pro. 887), spared Lynceus, the partner of her couch. Here one duty could not be observed without violating another, and thus was brought about that collision between two primary principles of human nature, the reconciliation of which constitutes the essence of the<pb n="406"/>
        Æschylean drama. The remark of Grote with reference to this feature of Grecian tragedy will be perused with interest: “The tragedian,” he says, “not only appeals more powerfully to the ethical sentiments than poetry had ever done before, but also, by raising these grave and touching questions, addresses a stimulus and challenge to the intellect, spurring it on to ethical speculation.”</p>
      <p>From the Hellenic point of view, Hypermnestra was regarded as a criminal, while the bloody deed of her sisters was extolled as an act of heroism, enjoined not only by their father, but by the gods themselves.</p>
      <p>The suitors, moreover, are represented from the first as in the highest degree insolent and overbearing: barbarians, they had dared to invade the sacred soil of Hellas, and the vengeance which had overtaken them would ally itself in the popular imagination with the destruction of the Oriental hosts which had so recently crowned the grand contemporary conflict between Persia and Hellas. This feeling would be heightened by the war between Egypt and Athens, which began B.C. 462.</p>
      <p>The trial of Hypermnestra most probably formed the principal subject of "The Danaides," the concluding member of the trilogy. From a fragment of the prologue which has been preserved, we learn that the drama opened with the hymn with which it was customary to awaken the newly-married pair:
      <lg type="quotation">
          <l>"Since now arises the bright lamp of day,</l>
          <l>The bridegrooms I awake with friendly lay,</l>
          <l>Chanted by choral bands of youths and maids."</l>
        </lg></p><pb n="407"/>
        
      <p>The horrors of the bridal night would thus be revealed, together with what was regarded as the treacherous clemency of Hypermnestra. According to the ancient story, she was cast by her father into prison, and subsequently brought to trial before a court with the constitution of which we are not acquainted. The goddess Aphrodite herself appears to plead her cause, reminding us of the trial of Orestes before the court of Areopagus, when Pallas Athena, as president, gave her casting vote in his favour.</p>
      <p>One fragment from the address of Aphrodite has been preserved:
      <lg type="quotation">
          <l>"Longs the pure sky to blend with Earth, and Love</l>
          <l>Doth Earth impel to yield to his embrace;</l>
          <l>The rain-shower, falling from the slumberous heaven,</l>
          <l>Kisses the Earth; and Earth brings forth for mortals</l>
          <l>Pasture for sheep-flocks and Demeter's grain.</l>
          <l>The woods in spring their dewy nuptials hold;</l>
          <l>And of all these I am in part the cause."</l>
        </lg></p>
      <p>Hypermnestra was acquitted, and from her union with Lynceus sprang in course of time the demigod Herakles. The remaining daughters of Danaos were purified from the stain of blood by Athena and Hermes, or, according to another form of the legend, by Zeus himself.</p>

<note type="footnote"><ref n="416.1">*</ref> “The bird of Zeus” is interpreted by the scholiast to mean the sun, for it arouses us from sleep as the cock does Pausanias distinctly asserts that the cock was considered sacred to the sun (lib. v. 25, 5); and that the sun was worshipped by the Argives (lib. ii. 18, 3). Probably there was some fancied connection between <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀλέκτωρ</quote> and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἠλέκτωρ</quote>, the Homeric title of the sun (Il. xix. 398; Hymn. ad Apoll. 369).—Paley.</note><pb n="417"/>

            <head>THE SUPPLIANTS.</head>
            <p>7. For <quote xml:lang="grc">γνωσθεῖσαι</quote> I think should be read <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐξωσθεῖσαι</quote>, extruded.</p>
            <p>8. <quote xml:lang="grc">αὐτογένητον φυξάνορα</quote> is the old text. The sense seems to require an epithet meaning voluntary, in contrast to legal expulsion. Perhaps the word <quote xml:lang="grc">αὐτάγρετος</quote> (Ionic for <quote xml:lang="grc">αὐθαίρετος</quote>) has been dropped out, from its similarity to <quote xml:lang="grc">αὐτογένητον</quote>. Then we obtain, with perfect sense and emphasis—<quote xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ' [αὐταγρέταις] αὐτογένητον φυξανορ[ίαις] γάμον Αἰγύπτου παίδων ἀσεβῆ τ᾽ ὀνοταζόμεναι.</quote></p>
            <p>In 27, 38, 40, it is difficult for me to believe that so careful a poet as Æschylus would write <quote xml:lang="grc">δέξαιθ', σφετεριξάμενον, ἐπικεκλόμεναι</quote>; which make the syntax as loose as that of Thucydides. I believe in <quote xml:lang="grc">δέξαισθε</quote> (in apposition to <quote xml:lang="grc">πέμψατε</quote>), <quote xml:lang="grc">σφετεριξαμένους</quote> (plural, as <quote xml:lang="grc">ὄλοιντο</quote>) <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπικεκλομένα</quote> (in apposition to <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπιλεξαμένα</quote>).</p>
            <p>45. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔφαψιν</quote> has no satisfactory syntax; in 43 the old text was <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνθονόμου τᾶς</quote>. Porson changed it to <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνθονομούσας</quote>, which is not plausible to me.</p>
            <p>52. The old text, <quote xml:lang="grc">τά τε νῦν</quote>, should, I think, be <quote xml:lang="grc">γενετᾶν</quote>, which completes the splendid conjectural corrections of Hermann and others, who change <quote xml:lang="grc">τεκμήρια τά τ' ἀνόμοι᾽ οἶδ'</quote> to <quote xml:lang="grc">τεκμήρι', ἃ γυιονόμοισιν</quote>. This one example may justly incite us in nonsensical passages to conjecture boldly.</p>
            <p>62. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ χώρων ποταμῶν τ'</quote> is certainly wrong. A very simple correction will be <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ χόρτων ποταμῶν τ'</quote>, from her feeding-places and streams, or even from her crofts and streams. In Pindar we find <quote xml:lang="grc">χόρτος λέοντος</quote>: in Eur. Iph. T. 134, <quote xml:lang="grc">χόρτων εὐδένδρων</quote>. (Hermann's <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ χλωρῶν πετάλων ἐγρομένα</quote> is audacity out of place.)</p>
            <p>70. If <quote xml:lang="grc">δειμαίνουσα</quote> be right, we have to join <quote xml:lang="grc">εἴτις</quote> with <quote xml:lang="grc">γόεδνα</quote>... in the sense of “I lament whether," which is certainly unnatural. Dindorf prints <quote xml:lang="grc">δεῖμα μένουσα</quote>, I suppose merely to show what the metre requires.</p>
            <p>78. For the old reading <quote xml:lang="grc">βωμὸς Ἄρης φύγασιν</quote>, which is certainly wrong, an obvious correction is <quote xml:lang="grc">βωμὸς ἀρειφύγασιν</quote>, which would be unexceptionable if we found it in the text. But other possibilities occur: thus the poet may have written <quote xml:lang="grc">Ἀρησφύγετον</quote> in imitation of the word <quote xml:lang="grc">Κρησφύγετον</quote>.</p>
            <p>80. <quote xml:lang="grc">Εἰ θείη Διὸς εὖ παναληθῶς!</quote> This is nonsense. To change <quote xml:lang="grc">Διὸς</quote> to <quote xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</quote> has no plausibility; all remains abrupt; <quote xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</quote> followed by <quote xml:lang="grc">Διὸς</quote> is scarcely possible. My present belief is that we get the poet's sense by <quote xml:lang="grc">Ἰθείᾳ Διὸς ἐν παναληθεῖ</quote>.... which means, “In the straight line of Jove, though drawn with perfect accuracy, the heart's desire of Jove is not easy to trace." Then the abruptness vanishes and the argument is solid. Moreover, in the next line <quote xml:lang="grc">τοι</quote> seems to introduce a general maxim. This suggests to me that <quote xml:lang="grc">πάντα</quote>, which is weak, ought to be <quote xml:lang="grc">βροντά</quote>.</p>
            <p>93. <quote xml:lang="grc">τὰν ἄποινον</quote> (the old text) is manifestly indefensible. Critics do not seem to have observed that in place of it we need the accusative after <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐξέπραξεν</quote>. Then we must put a full-stop after <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐξοπλίζει</quote>, and the sense needed will be given by <quote xml:lang="grc">Πάντα νόον δαιμονίων | μνῆμον ἄνω φρόνημά πως | αὐτόθεν ἐξέπραξεν</quote>...</p>
            <p>104. The little word <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ</quote> offends me, and suggests that <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ διάνοιαν</quote> should possibly be <quote xml:lang="grc">παιδὸς ἄνοιαν</quote>. Is the spondee in the third foot satisfactory?</p>
            <p>107. Remove the stop and join <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐμπρεπῆ</quote> with <quote xml:lang="grc">με</quote>.</p>
            <p>115, 116. <quote xml:lang="grc">πελομένων καλῶς | ἐπιδρομῶς ὅθι θάνατος ἀπῇ</quote>. This is mere chaos. The general sense needed is, that “incestuous marriages involve the gods in guilt:" <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐναγέα</quote> must be the predicate. I propose to change <quote xml:lang="grc">πελομένων</quote> to <quote xml:lang="grc">πέλοι ἂν οὐ</quote>, which gives the sense excellently. On comparing the strophe, it seems likely that v. 116 contains epithets of <quote xml:lang="grc">τέλεα</quote>, as v. 105 of <quote xml:lang="grc">μέλεα</quote>. To read for v. 116 <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπίδρομα, νόθα, θανατοσαπῆ</quote>, would be very close to the letters; but I think <quote xml:lang="grc">θανατοσαγῆ</quote>, “laden with death,” more likely, and it is but <quote xml:lang="grc">Γ</quote> for <quote xml:lang="grc">Π</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">Ἐπίδρομα</quote> I render invasive.</p>
            <p>118, 119. Punctuate with comma after <quote xml:lang="grc">πόνοι</quote>, and with full-stop after <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπάξει</quote>, and interpret, “The distresses are indefinable, into what the wave is to carry us;" that is, "It is doubtful, into what—"</p>
            <p>127. Join <quote xml:lang="grc">δορὸς ἀχείματον</quote>, escaping the storm of the spear. I do not think that <quote xml:lang="grc">δόμος δορὸς</quote> can mean a house of timber, as Scholefield seems to join it.</p>
            <p>203-206, of Scholefield, but 207-10 of the Oxford pocket edition, seem to be out of order. The two first lines should change places, and the fourth should be first.</p>
            <p>244. <quote xml:lang="grc">τηρὸν</quote> is difficult to justify and difficult to condemn; but I think <quote xml:lang="grc">ἱερόραβδον</quote> to be a fair and satisfactory correction of <quote xml:lang="grc">ἱεροῦ ῥάβδον</quote>.</p>
            <p>309. It seems impossible that <quote xml:lang="grc">ῥυσίων</quote> can be correct. I suggest <quote xml:lang="grc">ψαυσέων</quote>, strokings, caresses, equivalent to <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπαφησέων</quote>. The next line, which is lost, may have been <quote xml:lang="grc">τίς οὖν ἐς Ἔπαφον</quote> (or <quote xml:lang="grc">τίς δῆτα κείνῳ</quote>) <quote xml:lang="grc">κλεινὸν ἀναφέρει γένος</quote>.</p>
            <p>394. <quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ τοῖον</quote>, for unlucky, evil, is not plausible. <quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ τερπνὸν</quote> may suggest itself; but there are too many other possibilities.</p>
            <p>485. For the unmeaning <quote xml:lang="grc">εὖ ῥέοντα</quote> I suggest <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐγκρέοντα</quote>, equivalent to <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐμβασιλεύοντα</quote>.</p>
            <p>488. <quote xml:lang="grc">πολισσούχων</quote> all regard as wrongly repeated from the preceding line. One may suggest <quote xml:lang="grc">πολυλλίστους</quote>, or else <quote xml:lang="grc">πολυξείνους ἕδρας</quote>.</p>
            <p>492. The old <quote xml:lang="grc">φόβον</quote> seems to me quite right, and the change to <quote xml:lang="grc">φόνον</quote> quite wrong. "Beware, lest too much confidence produce alarm."</p>
            <p>510. Perhaps <quote xml:lang="grc">οὔτι</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">οὔ σε</quote>, as the sense seems to require.</p>
            <p>521. <quote xml:lang="grc">πιθοῦ τε καὶ γενέσθω</quote>. Obviously to me <quote xml:lang="grc">γενέσθω</quote> has supplanted some epithet of <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρῶν</quote>. The nearest word that I think of is <quote xml:lang="grc">πανεχθῶν</quote>. This is in itself irreprovable: <quote xml:lang="grc">πιθοῦ τε, καὶ πανεχθῶν | ἄλευσον ἀνδρῶν ὕβριν</quote>.</p>
            <p>528. <quote xml:lang="grc">γενοῦ πολυμνήστωρ</quote> cannot be right. Dindorf prints <quote xml:lang="grc">πολυμνῆστορ</quote> metri causâ, I suppose, rightly regarding <quote xml:lang="grc">ὕβριν</quote> as a pyrrhic in the strophe. Apparently for <quote xml:lang="grc">πολυμνήστωρ</quote> we need an accusative epithet of <quote xml:lang="grc">αἶνον</quote>, and for <quote xml:lang="grc">γενοῦ</quote> a genitive or dative, such as <quote xml:lang="grc">γόνου</quote> or <quote xml:lang="grc">γονῇ</quote> (not <quote xml:lang="grc">γένους</quote>, for that occurs twice besides in the sentence). I doubtfully propose <quote xml:lang="grc">νέωσον εὔφρον' αἶνον | γόνου πολύμνηστον</quote>. In the next line, <quote xml:lang="grc">τοι</quote> must be either interpreted <quote xml:lang="grc">σοὶ</quote>, I suppose, or changed into <quote xml:lang="grc">σοί</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔνοικοι</quote> seems to be for the prosaic <quote xml:lang="grc">ἔποικοι</quote>, settlers.</p>
            <p>550. <quote xml:lang="grc">εἰσικνουμένου</quote>, after <quote xml:lang="grc">ἰκνεῖται</quote>, is hardly credible. Dindorf's <quote xml:lang="grc">εἰσικνουμένη</quote> does not remove this objection. Hermann's conjecture <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐγκεχριμένη</quote> seems to me quite justified.</p>
            <p>555. Surely <quote xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ τὸ Νείλου</quote> ought to be <quote xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ τε Νείλου</quote>. The poet says that the wind of the desert (<quote xml:lang="grc">τυφῶ μένος</quote>) and the water of Nile come upon the snow-fed fields of Egypt. Like Herodotus, he supposed that snow, melting in the highlands of Abyssinia, kept the Nile full through the summer.</p>
            <p>558. <quote xml:lang="grc">θείας</quote> is clearly wrong, yet it is hard to believe <quote xml:lang="grc">θυιὰς</quote> right. Some deeper change may lie hid something like -λητος ὁδοῦ πονήρας, I mean.</p>
            <p>572. I do not see how <quote xml:lang="grc">βία</quote> can be nominative to <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀποστάζει</quote>. Until the lost line is supplied, all conjecture is infirm.</p>
            <p>574. I protest against rendering <quote xml:lang="grc">ἕρμα</quote>, ballast, as an utter monstrosity, and suggest that it means gem, germ. Compare Iliad, iv. 117, and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἕρματα</quote> for gems, <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅρμος</quote>, a necklace.</p>
            <p>580. The logic of <quote xml:lang="grc">τίς γὰρ</quote> proves that the previous lines assert the progeny to have been Jupiter's; hence <quote xml:lang="grc">Ζηνὸς</quote> must be predicate, and <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ δὴ</quote> cannot possibly be right. I propose to change it to <quote xml:lang="grc">τόδε</quote>.</p>
            <p>628. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀρότοις ἐν ἄλλοις</quote> implies that ἄροτος in a literal sense has been named in the previous lines: I think, therefore, that <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄχορον</quote> has somehow come in place of the word <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄροτος</quote>. In the antistrophe, for <quote xml:lang="grc">πράκτορά τε σκόπον</quote>, which is certainly wrong, I would suggest <quote xml:lang="grc">πράκτορ' αὐτόσκοπον</quote>.</p>
            <p>672. Paley well changes <quote xml:lang="grc">τὼς</quote> to <quote xml:lang="grc">γᾶς</quote>.</p>
            <p>674. I like the Aldine reading <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβωμὰν</quote> better than <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ βωμῶν</quote> or <quote xml:lang="grc">βωμοῖς</quote>. We probably all adopt <quote xml:lang="grc">μοῦσαν θείατ'</quote>, with Ahrens and Hermann, for <quote xml:lang="grc">μοῦσαι θεαί τε</quote>.</p>
            <p>678-680. The common text is certainly wrong; yet it may be corrected in more ways than one. For <quote xml:lang="grc">τὸ πτόλιν κρατύναι</quote> I wish <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ πόλιν κρατύνοι</quote>, which explains syntax and sentiment, so as to open the poet's meaning, probably, thus: <quote xml:lang="grc">φυλάσσοι τ' αἰσίμοισι τιμὰς | τὸ δήμιον, καὶ πόλιν κρατύνοι | προμαθίαις ξυνόμητις ἀρχά</quote>. This is the poet's ideal of a well-tempered free state. "Let the folk reserve honours (public offices) for the virtuous, and let a magistracy of common counsel stablish the city by previous deliberations." <quote xml:lang="grc">Προμάθιαι</quote> is poetical for <quote xml:lang="grc">προβουλεύματα</quote>. For <quote xml:lang="grc">αἰσίμοισι</quote> the old text has <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμίας</quote>, which is manifestly wrong.</p>
            <p>775. <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπρόσδεικτος</quote>, a rock that "cannot be pointed at”! Rather, I think, <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀπρόσμικτος</quote>, inaccessible.</p>
            <p>786. <quote xml:lang="grc">τίν' ἀμφ' αὐτᾶς ἔτι πόρον | τέμνω γάμου καὶ λυτήρια</quote>. This chaos would be desperate, only that the metre of the strophe guides us. (Dindorf there changes <quote xml:lang="grc">καρδίας</quote> to <quote xml:lang="grc">κάρτας</quote>, quite causelessly.) I see nothing for it but audacious conjecture, thus: <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐλθέτω μόρος πρὸ κοί | τας γαμηλίου, τυχὼν | τᾶνδ' ὑφᾶν, τελεσφόρον | δεμνίων γάμου καλύπτραν.</quote> | Here <quote xml:lang="grc">τᾶνδ' ὑφᾶν</quote> is the <quote xml:lang="grc">σάργαναι</quote> of v. 768, and <quote xml:lang="grc">καλύπτραν</quote> is accusative in apposition to the sentence, as in Ag. 218, where we supply <quote xml:lang="grc">λέγω</quote> with <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀρωγάν</quote>.</p>
            <p>979. <quote xml:lang="grc">κἄλωρα κωλύουσαν ὡς μένειν ἐρᾷ</quote>, is confessedly nonsense. The first word is corrected to <quote xml:lang="grc">κἄωρα</quote>, rather (I think) <quote xml:lang="grc">κἄνωρα</quote>, since Herodotus has <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄνωρος</quote> and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀνωρία</quote>. <quote xml:lang="grc">῎Ανωρα</quote>, as less usual than <quote xml:lang="grc">ἄωρα</quote>, might get corrupted. Further, I suggest, <quote xml:lang="grc">κἄνωρα</quote> [or <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ χλωρὰ</quote>] <quote xml:lang="grc">κωλύουσ' ἄνθος μένειν ἐρᾷ</quote> : that is, <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐρᾷ</quote> (<quote xml:lang="grc">φιλεῖ</quote>) <quote xml:lang="grc">κωλύουσα</quote>, “she loves to hinder the unripe from awaiting their bloom (their prime).”</p>
            <p>983. For <quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ πάθωμεν</quote> I think we need <quote xml:lang="grc">μὴ λαθώμεθ'</quote> (“let us not forget”), unless a whole line is lost after <quote xml:lang="grc">δορί</quote>.</p>
