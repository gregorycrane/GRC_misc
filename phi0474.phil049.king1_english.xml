                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>ON at last securing a complete or at any rate a considerable release from the toils of advocacy<ref n="3.1">¹</ref> and from my senatorial duties, I have once more—chiefly, Brutus, on your encouragement—returned to those studies, which, though stored in memory, had been put aside through circumstances, and are now revived after a long interval of neglect. My view was that, inasmuch as the system and method of instruction in all the arts which have a bearing upon the right conduct of life is bound up with the study of wisdom which goes by the name of philosophy, it was incumbent on me to throw light upon that study by a work in the Latin tongue; not that philosophy could not be learnt from Greek writers and teachers, but it has always been my conviction that our countrymen have shown more wisdom everywhere than the Greeks, either in making discoveries for themselves, or else in improving upon what they had received from Greece—in such subjects at least as they had judged worthy of the devotion of their efforts.<ref n="3.2">²</ref></p>

               our ancestors have adopted better regulations and laws than others in directing the policy of government. What shall I say of the art of war? In this sphere our countrymen have proved their superiority by valour as well as in an even greater degree by discipline. When we come to natural gifts apart from book-learning they are above comparison with the Greeks or any other people. Where has such earnestness, where such firmness, greatness of soul, honesty, loyalty, where has such surpassing merit in every field been found in any of mankind to justify comparison with our ancestors?</p>

                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>In learning Greece surpassed us and in all branches of literature, and victory was easy where there was no contest. For while with the Greeks the poets are the oldest literary class, seeing that Homer and Hesiod lived before the foundation of Rome and Archilochus<ref n="5.1">¹</ref> lived in the reign of Romulus, poetry came to us at a later date. About five hundred and ten years after the foundation of Rome Livius produced a play in the consulship of C. Claudius, son of Caecus, and M. Tuditanus in the year before the birth of Ennius, who was older than Plautus and Naevius.<ref n="5.2">²</ref></p>
         
               <p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/> At a late date then were poets either known or welcomed by our countrymen. Though it is stated in the <hi rend="italics">Origines</hi>
                  <ref n="5.3">³</ref> that guests were in the habit of singing at banquets in honour of the virtues of famous men to the playing of a piper, yet a speech of Cato's shows that this kind of talent was not held in respect, for in it he censured M. Nobilior for having, as he declares, taken poets in his suite to his province. It is, as we know, matter of fact that Nobilior when consul had taken Ennius<ref n="5.4">⁴</ref> to Aetolia. The lighter then the esteem in which poetry was
               <pb n="7"/>
               held, the less was the devotion paid to it, and yet such writers as have by virtue of great natural endowments proved themselves poets, have not failed to be a worthy match for the glory of the Greeks.</p>
                  </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="section"><p>Or do we suppose that if Fabius Pictor, a man of noble family, had managed to win fame for his painting,<ref n="7.1">¹</ref> we too should not have had many a Polyclitus<ref n="7.2">²</ref> and Parrhasius? Public esteem is the nurse of the arts, and all men are fired to application by fame, whilst those pursuits which meet with general disapproval, always lie neglected. The Greeks held that the proof of the highest education was found in instrumental and vocal music: thus it is that Epaminondas, to my mind the leading man in Greek history, was, we are told, an accomplished singer to the accompaniment of the harp, whilst Themistocles, to go back many years previously, was held to show a lack of culture in refusing to play the lyre at banquets. Musicians accordingly flourished in Greece; everyone would learn music, and the man who was unacquainted with the art was not regarded as completely educated.</p>

            <div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="section">
               <p>With the Greeks geometry was regarded with the utmost respect, and consequently none were held in greater honour than mathematicians, but we Romans have restricted this art to the practical purposes of measuring and reckoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>But on the other hand we speedily welcomed the orator—not at first the cultivated but the ready speaker and at a later date the cultivated orator. For Galba, Africanus and Laelius were, as tradition has told us, well-read, while Cato who preceded them was a diligent student; next came Lepidus, Carbo and the Gracchi;<ref n="7.3">³</ref> after them up to our day
               <pb n="9"/>
               orators of such power that little or no ground at all was yielded in favour of the Greeks. Philosophy has lain neglected to this day, and Latin literature has thrown no light upon it: it must be illuminated and exalted by us, so that, if in the active business of life I have been of service to my countrymen, I may also, if I can, be of service to them in my leisure.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="section">
               <p>And I must exert myself all the more actively because there are now, it is said, a number of books in Latin<ref n="9.1">¹</ref> written without due care by writers who with all their merits are yet insufficiently equipped. Now it is possible for an author to hold right views and yet be unable to express them in a polished style; but to commit one's reflections to writing, without being able to arrange or express them clearly or attract the reader by some sort of charm, indicates a man who makes an unpardonable misuse of leisure and his pen. The result is that such writers read their own books themselves along with their own circle, and none of them reaches any wider public than that which wishes to have the same privilege of scribbling extended to itself. For this reason, if by my assiduity I have won for our countrymen some measure of oratorical renown, I shall with far greater enthusiasm lay bare the springs of philosophy, which were also the source from which those earlier efforts of mine took their rise.</p>

               wisdom with eloquence, similarly it is my design not to lay aside my early devotion to the art of expression, but to employ it in this grander and more fruitful art: for it has ever been my conviction that philosophy in its finished form enjoys the power of treating the greatest problems with adequate fulness and in an attractive style. To this endeavour I devoted myself with such energy that I actually reached the point of venturing to give dissertations in the manner of the Greeks: for instance, recently after your departure, as there were a number of close friends staying with me, I attempted in my house at Tusculum to see what I could do in this sort of exercise: for just as in my youth I used to be constantly declaiming speeches for the courts—and no one ever did so longer—so this is now a declamation<ref n="11.1">¹</ref> of my old age. I called upon my friends to put forward any subject which any of them wished to hear discussed, and this I debated either as I sat or walked about.</p>

            <div type="textpart" n="8" subtype="section">
               <p>The result is that I have put together into five books the dissertations, as the Greeks term them, of as many days. The procedure was that, after the would-be listener had expressed his view, I opposed it. This, as you know, is the old Socratic method of arguing against your adversary's position; for Socrates thought that in this way the probable truth was most readily discovered; but in order that the course of our discussions may be more conveniently followed I shall put them before you in the form of a debate and not in narrative form.

                  <speaker>A.</speaker> My wish would be for both courses if it could be managed, but it is a difficult matter to combine the two. Therefore if, without discussing these further questions, we can get free from the fear of death, let this be our aim; but if that is impossible, unless this problem of the nature of the soul is first unravelled, let us take that problem first and the other question later.</p>

               it will vanish away. Why speak of Dicaearchus, a thinker who says the soul is nothing at all? According to all these views nothing can appertain to anyone after death, for along with life is lost the power of sensation; moreover there is nothing to make any sort of difference to a being without sensation. The views of the rest of the teachers offer the hope, if this happen to rejoice you, that souls, on their separation from the body, find their way to heaven as to their dwelling-place.</p>

<note n="29.1">It looks as if Cicero had confused two different words, ἐνδελέχεια and ἐντελέχεια.

This is movement, and Aristotle denies any movement to the soul. It seems then that if Cicero wrote ἐντελέχεια he has given it a wrong meaning: if he wrote ἐνδελέχεια he has not used Aristotle's word. That the difficulty about the two words is a very old one is shown by Lucian's Δίκη Φωκαέντων 10, where δέλτα accuses ταῦ of filching ἐνδελέχεια illegally and getting it turned into ἐντελέχεια.

It is not for his own discomfort that anyone grieves; men feel, it may be, sorrow and anguish; but our customary melancholy wailing and weeping for grief come from the thought that the being we have loved is robbed of the comforts of life and is sensible of their loss; and this feeling of ours is due, not to any process of reasoning or instruction, but to the promptings of nature.</p>

Hercules passed away to join the gods: he would never have so passed, unless in the course of his mortal life he had built for himself the road he travelled.

When the soul has passed this tract and reaches to and recognizes a substance resembling its own, it stops amongst the fires which are formed of rarefied air and the modified glow of the sun and ceases to make higher ascent. For when it has reached conditions of lightness and heat resembling its own, it becomes quite motionless, as though in a state of equilibrium with its surroundings, and then, and not before, finds its natural home, when it has pierced to conditions resembling its own, and there, with all its needs satisfied, it will be nourished and maintained on the same food which maintains and nourishes the stars.<ref n="53.1">1</ref></p>

Objects perceived by the senses are always changing and hardly ever the same. The soul is akin to the invisible and unchanging: the body to the visible and changing. The body drags the soul into the region of the visible and changing, and the soul wanders and is confused. We make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible connection or fellowship with the body.

But suppose, as these thinkers hold, that souls do not survive after death: I see that in that case we are deprived of the hope of a happier life. But what evil does such a view imply? For suppose that the soul perishes like the body: is there then any definite sense of pain or sensation at all in the body after death? There is no one who says so, though Epicurus accuses Democritus of this, but the followers of Democritus deny it. And so there is no sensation in the soul either, for the soul is nowhere. Where, then, is the evil, since there is no third thing? Is it because the actual departure of soul from body does not take place without sense of pain? Though I should believe this to be so, how petty a matter it is! But I think it false, and the fact is that often the departure takes place without sensation, sometimes even with a feeling of pleasure; and the whole thing is trivial, whatever the truth, for departure takes place in a moment of time.</p>

               <p>But let us go so far as to make the admission that mankind are deprived of blessings by death: must we therefore also grant that the dead feel the need of the comforts of life, and that this is a condition of wretchedness?<ref n="103.2">2</ref> Assuredly that is what they must say. Is it possible for the man who does not exist to "feel the need of" anything? The mere term "feeling the need of" has a melancholy sound, because the meaning that underlies it is, he had, he has not; he misses, looks for, wants. These, I think, are the discomforts of one who "feels the need of"; he "feels the need of" eyes, blindness is hateful; of children, barrenness is hateful. This holds good among the living, but as regards the dead, no one "feels the need," I do not say of the comforts of life, but even of life itself. I say this of the dead who do not exist; but do we who exist "feel the need" in this sense of horns or feathers? Can anyone make such a statement? Undoubtedly none. Why so? Because, as you are without that for which you are suited neither by acquired skill nor by nature, you cannot "feel the need of" it, even if you should be conscious that you do not possess it.</p>

               <p>This argument must be repeatedly insisted upon when we have firmly established the point, about which, if souls are mortal, we can have no doubt, namely that destruction in death is so complete that not even the faintest vestige of sensation is left behind: when that, then, is properly settled for once and all, we must thoroughly sift, so as to be sure of it, the meaning of "feeling the need of," that there may be no possibility of mistake in using the phrase. This then is the meaning of "feeling the   <pb n="105"/> need of,"<ref n="105.1">1</ref> to be in want of anything you wish to possess; for there is a notion of wish in "feeling the need of,"—except when the word <hi rend="italics">carere</hi> is used in another sense, as for instance of a fever, meaning "to be without fever." For it is using the word in quite a different sense to use it where one has not got something and is conscious of not having it, even if one can readily put up with being without it. To "feel the need of" is not used in connection with evil; for then evil would not be a thing to grieve about: the expression "to feel the need of" a good is used, and that amounts to an evil. But not even a living man "feels the need of" a good, if he does not want it. In the case of a living man it is, however, intelligible to say that you "feel the need of" a throne—that, however, cannot be said quite accurately in your case, though it could have been in the case of Tarquin after he had been dethroned<ref n="105.2">2</ref>—: 
                
                <pb n="107"/>
                still in the case of a dead man it is not even intelligible, for "to feel the need of" is appropriate to a sentient being, and in a dead man there is no sensation in a dead man therefore there is no possibility either of " feeling the need of."</p>

And so the man who concludes that the soul is mortal may yet attempt deeds that will not die, not from a thirst for fame, of which he will have no enjoyment, but from a thirst for virtue, which of necessity secures fame, even if it be not its object.

I am quoting
                     examples of men of what temper, pray, was the
                     Spartan woman? When she had sent her son to
                     battle and heard the news of his death, "To that
                     end," said she, "had I borne him, to be a man who
                     should not hesitate to meet death for his country."</p>
               
                  <p>XLIII. Be it so, for brave and hardy Spartans ;
                     the training of the State has a mighty power. Yes,
                     but do we not admire Theodorus of Cyrene,<ref n="122.1">1</ref>

                     philosopher? When King Lysimachus threatened
                     him with crucifixion : "Make, I beg," said he," your
                     abominable threats to those courtiers of yours in the
                     scarlet liveries: it makes no difference to Theodorus
                     whether he rots on the ground or in the air." And
                     this saying suggests the thought that I ought to
                     say a word about interment and burial-no difficult
                     matter, particularly after we have mastered what
                     was said a little while back about absence of sensa-
                     tion; and as a matter of fact Socrates' view on
                     the subject is given clearly in the book which
                     relates his death, of which we have already said so

For after he had discussed the immortality
                     of souls and the hour of death was close at hand,
                     when asked by Crito how he wished to be buried,
                     "My friends," said he, "I have indeed spent a deal
                     of labour to no purpose, for I have not convinced
                     our friend Crito that I shall fly hence and leave

                     bury me as you think fit. But, believe me, none
                     of you will come up with me when I have gone
                     hence.' That was indeed nobly said, for he gave

                     whether he wished in the event of need to be taken
                     away to Clazomonae, his native land: "There is no

                     to the lower world is just as far." Accordingly one
                     principle must be adhered to in dealing with the

                     body, whether the soul has perished or is still
                     vigorous in the body, however, it is plain that,
                     when the soul has either been annihilated or made

We must therefore hold fast the principle
                     that there is no need, when you see numbers of men
                     punishing even dead enemies, to be anxious about
                     anything after death. In Ennius Thyestes utters
                     curses in quite magnificent verses, praying first that
                     Atreus may die by shipwreck: a cruel prayer this
                     no doubt; for such an end involves grievous
                     consciousness of death: the following lines are
                     meaningless :
                     <quote>
    <l>Right on the top of rugged rocks transfixed and
                     burst asunder,</l>

                     tion than he "hung by the flank"; for whom
                     Thyestes imagines he is desiring torments. They
                     would have been cruel, had the victim the power of
                     sensation; without sensation they are non-existent.</p>

                     ceptions under which races of mankind labour? The
                     Egyptians embalm their dead and keep them in the
                     house; the Persians even smear them with wax before
                     burial, that the bodies may last for as long a time as
                     possible; it is the custom of the Magi not to bury
                     the bodies of their dead unless they have been
                     first mangled by wild beasts; in Hyrcania the
                     populace support dogs for the benefit of the com-
                     munity, while the nobles keep them for family use :
                     it is as we know a famous breed of dogs, but in
                     spite of the cost, each householder procures animals

                     us—with this proviso, however, that we, the living,
                     are conscious that the bodies of the dead have no

                     realize that in no way does it concern the dead.</p><p>
                     But assuredly death is encountered with most
                     equanimity when the failing life can find solace
                     in the reputation it has won. No one has lived too
                     short a life who has discharged the perfect work
                     of perfect virtue. In my life there have been many
                     occasions when death would have been timely, and
                     would I could have found it! for there was no
                     longer anything to be won; life's duties had been
                     discharged in full; the war with fortune alone
                     remained. If therefore my arguments fail to con-
                     vince us that we can ignore death, yet let a life
                     completed make us think that we have lived
                     sufficiently and more. For though consciousness
                     may have gone, nevertheless the dead, unconscious
                     though they be, are not without their own peculiar
                     blessings of fame and glory. There is, it may be,
                     nothing in glory that we should desire it, but none
                     the less it follows virtue like a shadow.</p>

The brazen heaven he cannot ever scale (ὁ χάλκεος οὐρανὸς οὔ ποτ᾽ ἀμβατὸς αὐτῷ). He has reached the height of human felicity and cannot hope for more."

Such achievements the Greeks think
                     glorious-too much so perhaps or rather thought
                     so in that day, and he, who spoke in this way

that the dead

                     admission of yours we find our chief solace in seasons
                     of longing and sorrow. For our own grief, and
                     grief felt on our account, we ought to bear in a

                     lovers of self; it is a notion of unendurable torment
                     if we believe that those, of whom we have been
                     bereft, have some feeling of consciousness amid the
                     evils in which ordinary belief imagines them in-
                     volved. It has been my wish to root up this belief
                     from my mind and cast it out, and for that reason

                     make me long for death, whilst the effect of the

                     of all you said, however, is that I do not reckon
                     death among evils. M. Do we then require in

It is
                     a well-known tale: religious observance required that
                     on a fixed annual date of sacrifice she should be
                     drawn to the spot in a chariot, and it was some
                     distance from the town to the shrine; the animals
                     conveying her were lagging, whereupon the youths,
                     whom I named just now, stripped and anointed their
                     bodies with oil and took their place at the yoke.
                     In this way the priestess was conveyed to the shrine
                     and, according to the tale, as the car had been
                     drawn by her sons, she prayed the goddess to grant
                     them for their filial love the greatest boon that
                     could be bestowed on man by God; after they had
                     feasted with their mother the young men fell asleep

                     Apollo at Delphi they worshipped the god and asked
                     in return for their toil and the work they had
                     accomplished a recompense, no light one it is true,

                     prayer the third ensuing day, and when it dawned
                     they were found dead. The god, they say, gave

                     an ancient rhetorician of the first distinction, actually
                     wrote an encomium on death which consists of a list

                     commonly reckoned glorious by rhetoricians but also
                     happy. They go back to Erechtheus, whose daughters   <pb n="141"/> sought even with eagerness for death to save
                     the lives of their fellow-citizens; they give the tale
                     of Codrus who flung himself into the midst of the
                     enemy in the costume of a slave to avoid the re-

I on the other hand, Brutus, think that for my part I “must” play the philosopher; for what can I busy myself with better, above all at a time when I have nothing to busy myself with? But not “a little way” as Neoptolemus said, for it is difficult to have a little knowledge in philosophy without having either a great deal or all that there is: for neither can a little be selected except from much nor, when a man has learnt a little, will he not also go on with the same eagerness to master what remains.</p>

It is impossible for me to express the delight or rather the feeling of comfort I derived from yesterday's discussion, for though I am not aware of having ever been over-anxious to live, nevertheless a shadow of fear and pain occasionally crossed my mind at the thought that one day there would be an end of this light of day and a loss of all the comforts of life.</p>

There is nothing astonishing in that, for it shows the effect of philosophy: it is a physician of souls, takes away the load of empty troubles, sets us free from desires and banishes fears. But its influence cannot be the same for all its effect is great when it has secured a hold upon a character suited to it. For it is not only true that "fortune helps the brave," as the old proverb says, but philosophic thought does so in a far higher degree, and by its lessons strengthens as it were the quality of bravery. Nature clearly gave you at your birth a certain elevated and lofty spirit that looks down on things earthly, and so a speech delivered against death readily found a resting place in a brave soul. But can you think that these same arguments have real influence, apart from quite a few exceptions, with the very men by whom these arguments were discovered, reasoned out and committed to writing? How few philosophers are found to be so constituted and to have principles and a rule of life so firmly settled as reason requires! how few there are to think that the tenets of their school are not a display of knowledge but a law of life! to control themselves of their own will and obey their own dogmas!</p>

and this seems to me a black disgrace. For just as it is if a teacher claiming to be a grammarian were guilty of solecisms, or one who should wish to be regarded as a musician were to sing out of tune; the disgrace would be enhanced by the fact of his failure in the very subject of which he professed the knowledge ; similarly the philosopher who fails to observe his rule of life is the more deeply disgraced, because he stumbles in the duty of which he aims at being the teacher and fails in the conduct of life though professing to give the rule of life.

                  <p>But do you note the harm which poets do? They represent brave men wailing, they enervate our souls, and besides this they do it with such charm that they are not merely read, but learnt by heart. Thus when the influence of the poets is combined with bad family discipline and a life passed in the shade of effeminate seclusion, the strength of manliness is completely sapped. Plato<ref n="175.1">1</ref> was right then in turning them out of his imaginary State, when he was trying to find the highest morality and the best conditions for the community.

But you, young man, after saying a little while ago that you shared this view, when asked by me whether you thought that it was a greater evil even than disgrace, at a word<ref n="175.2">2</ref> abandoned your opinion. Put the same question to Epicurus: he will say that a moderate degree of pain is worse evil than the deepest disgrace, for no evil is involved in disgrace alone, unless it should be attended by painful circumstances. What pain then does Epicurus feel when he actually affirms that pain is the greatest evil?<ref n="175.3">3</ref> And yet I cannot look to find any worse disgrace than such a sentiment in the mouth of a philosopher.

                  <p>Therefore if, as you admitted at the outset, disgrace is worse than pain,<ref n="179.3">3</ref> pain is clearly of no account; for whilst you shall hold it base and unworthy of a man to groan, shriek aloud, wail, break down and be unnerved; so long as honour, so long as nobility, so long as worth remain, and so long as you control yourself by keeping your eyes upon them, assuredly pain will lead to virtue and grow fainter by a deliberate effort of will; for either no virtue exists or all pain is to be despised. Do you believe in the existence of prudence, without which we cannot so much as realize the meaning of any virtue? What then? Will prudence<ref n="179.4">4</ref> suffer you to do anything without thereby gaining any advantage and so only wasting effort uselessly; can it be that temperance will allow you to act without self-restraint; can justice be practised by a man who discloses secrets, betrays accomplices, and turns his back on a multitude of obligations because of the violence of pain?</p>

XIX. Epicurus steps forward,—in no sense an ill-meaning person, or rather a gentleman of the best intentions, he gives advice to the extent of his ability. “Ignore pain,” he says. Who says this? The same thinker who pronounces pain the highest evil. This is not quite consistent. Let us listen. “If pain is at its highest,” says he, “it must be short.”
“Repeat that once again to me!”<ref n="197.1">1</ref>
For I do not quite understand what you mean by “at its highest” and what you mean by “short.” “By ‘at the highest’ I mean that which has nothing higher; by ‘short’ I mean that which has nothing shorter. I scorn a degree of pain from which a brief space of time will deliver me almost before it has come.” But what if the pain be as severe as that of Philoctetes? “I admit it seems to me pretty severe, but all the same it is not at the highest; for his pain is only in the foot; there can be pain in the eyes, pain in the head, sides, lungs, pain everywhere. He is therefore far from suffering pain at the highest.” “Therefore,” says he, “continuous pain admits of more of gladness than of vexation.”<ref n="197.2">2</ref></p>

Will you, though you have seen boys in Lacedaemon, young men at Olympia, barbarians in the arena submitting to the heaviest blows and enduring them in silence—will you, if some pain happen to give you a twitch, cry out like a woman and not endure resolutely and calmly?—“It is unbearable; nature cannot put up with it.”—Very well. Boys endure from love of fame, others endure for shame's sake, many from fear, and yet are we afraid that nature cannot put up with what so many have endured in such a number of different places? Nature in fact not only puts up with but even demands it; for she offers nothing more excellent, nothing more desirable than honour, than renown, than distinction, than glory. By all this number of terms there is only one thing that I want to express,

but I employ a number, in order to make my meaning as clear as possible. What I want to say in fact is that far the best for man is that which is desirable in and for itself, has its source in virtue or rather is based on virtue, is of itself praiseworthy, and in fact I should prefer to describe it as the only rather than the highest good. Moreover, just as we use language like this in speaking of what is honourable, so we use the opposite in speaking of what is base: there is nothing so revolting, nothing so despicable, nothing more unworthy of a human being.</p>

As a rule, all men's minds contain naturally an element of weakness, despondency, servility, a kind of nervelessness and flaccidity. Had human nature nothing else, no creature would be more hideous than man; but reason, the mistress and queen of the world, stands close at hand and mounting by her own strength and pressing onward she becomes completed virtue.

If the part of the soul, which I have described as yielding, conducts itself disgracefully, if it give way in womanish fashion to lamentation and weeping, let it be fettered and tightly bound by the guardianship of friends and relations; for often we find men crushed by a sense of shame at being overcome without any reason. Such persons therefore we shall have almost to keep in chains and guard closely like slaves, whilst those who shall be found more steadfast, though not of the highest strength, we shall have to warn to be mindful of honour, like good soldiers recalled to duty.

Moreover this rule which is laid down for pain has a wider scope, for we must resist everything and not merely pain with a similar straining of every nerve of the soul. Anger blazes up, lust is roused: we must hasten for refuge to the same citadel, we must take up the same weapons; but as pain is our subject, let us leave other illustrations on one side. To enable us to bear pain quietly and calmly it is a very great gain to reflect with all our heart and mind, as the saying is, how honourable<ref n="213.2">2</ref> it is to do so. Nature has made us, as I have said before—it must often be repeated—enthusiastic seekers after honour, and once we have caught, as it were, some glimpse of its radiance, there is nothing we are not prepared to bear and go through in order to secure it. It is from this rush, this impulse of our souls towards true renown and reputation that the dangers of battle are encountered; brave men do not feel wounds in the line of battle, or feel them, but prefer death rather than move a step from the post that honour has appointed.</p>

peace, at home, in our easy chairs? You call me back to the philosophers who do not often<ref n="215.1">1</ref> step into the battle-line, and one of whom, Dionysius of Heraclea,<ref n="215.2">2</ref> a person certainly of little resolution, after learning from Zeno to be brave was taught by pain to forget his lesson. For upon an attack of kidney trouble, even amid his shrieks, he kept on crying out that the opinions he had himself previously held about pain were false. And on being asked by Cleanthes,<ref n="215.3">3</ref> his fellow-pupil, what was the reason that had seduced him from his former opinion, he replied: “Because if,<ref n="215.4">4</ref> after I had given such devoted attention to philosophy, I yet proved unable to bear pain, that would be sufficient proof that pain was an evil. Now I have spent many years in studying philosophy and am unable to bear pain: pain is therefore an evil.” Then Cleanthes stamped with his foot upon the ground and, according to the story, recited a line from the Epigoni:<ref n="215.5">5</ref>

wounds, either from thirst for victory or fame, or even to maintain their own right or freedom, and yet the same men, when the strain of effort is relaxed, are unable to bear the pain of disease; the reason is that the pain they had readily endured, they had endured, not from principle or the teaching of philosophy, but from motives rather of ambition and fame. We find accordingly some uncivilized barbarians able to fight desperately to the end with the sword but unable to behave like men in sickness. The Greeks on the other hand, who are not so very courageous but have a sufficiency of sense answering to their mental powers, cannot look an enemy in the face;<ref n="221.1">1</ref> and yet these same men show endurance and spirit, as human beings should, in bearing sickness, while the Cimbri and Celtiberians<ref n="221.2">2</ref> revel in battle and wail in sickness.

Reflect on these considerations, I pray, by day and night, for this principle will spread more widely in its application and cover a field a good deal larger than the consideration of pain alone; for if we are to do everything with the object of avoiding baseness and securing honour, we shall have the right of despising not merely the stings of pain but the bolts of fortune as well, especially

The brave man is also self-reliant; for “confident” is by a mistaken usage of speech used in a bad sense, though the word is derived from confidere, “to have trust,” which implies praise. The self-reliant man, however, is assuredly not excessively fearful; for there is a difference between confidence and timidity. And yet the man who is accessible to distress is also accessible to fear. For where things cause us distress by their presence, we are also

afraid of the menace of their approach. So it comes that distress is incompatible with fortitude. It is therefore probable that the man who is susceptible of distress is also susceptible of fear, and indeed of dejection and depression of soul. Where men are susceptible of these emotions there also comes a feeling of subjection, a readiness to admit themselves beaten should occasion arise. He who makes this admission has to admit fear and cowardice as well. But of such feelings the brave man is not susceptible: therefore he is not susceptible of distress either.

Therefore the wise man is not susceptible of distress. And just as the eye, if out of order, is not in a right condition for discharging its function, and the other members, or the body as a whole, if it is not in its normal condition, fails to perform its function and work: similarly the soul, if disquieted, is not fitted to carry out its work. But the work of the soul is the right use of reason, and the soul of the wise man is always in a condition to make the best use of reason. Therefore it is never in a disordered state.

                  <p>XI. It is then wholly in an idea that we find the cause not merely indeed of distress but of all other disturbances as well, and these can be classified as four with numerous subdivisions. For as all disturbance is a movement of the soul either destitute of reason, or contemptuous of reason, or disobedient to reason, and as such a movement is provoked in two ways, either by an idea of good or idea of evil, we have four disturbances equally divided. For there are two proceeding from an idea of good, one of which is exuberant pleasure, that is to say, joy excited beyond measure by the idea of some great present good; the second is the intemperate longing for a supposed great good, and this longing is disobedient to reason, and may be rightly termed desire or lust.</p>

                  <p>Therefore these two classes, exuberant pleasure and lust springing from the idea of good, disturb the soul just as the two remaining, fear and distress, cause disturbances by the idea of evil. For fear is the idea of a serious threatening evil and distress is the idea of a serious present evil and indeed an idea freshly conceived of an evil of such sort that it seems a due reason for anguish; now that means that the man who feels the pain believes that he ought to feel pain. We must, however, with all our might and main resist these disturbances which folly looses and launches like a kind of evil spirit upon the life of mankind, if we wish to pass our allotted span in peace and quiet.

Indeed, while all disturbance is wretchedness, “distress” means being actually put upon the rack.

                  <p>Alleviation of distress, however, Epicurus finds in two directions, namely in calling the soul away from reflection upon vexation and in a “recall”<ref n="267.1">1</ref> to the consideration of pleasures. For he thinks the soul able to obey reason and follow its guidance. Reason therefore (in his view) forbids attention to vexations, withdraws the soul from morose reflections, blunts its keenness in dwelling upon wretchedness and, sounding a retreat from such thoughts, eagerly urges it on again to descry a variety of pleasures and engage in them with all the powers of the mind; and according to this philosopher the wise man's life is packed with the recollection of past and the prospect of future pleasures.

For there is nothing so well fitted to deaden and alleviate distress as the continual life-long reflection that there is no event which may not happen; nothing so serviceable as the consideration of our state as human beings, as the study of the law of our being and the practice of obedience to it; and the effect of this is not to make us always sad but to prevent us from being so at all.

And do you, Epicurus, bid me "forget," though to forget is contrary to nature, while you wrest from my grasp the aid which nature has supplied for the relief of long-standing pain? For there is a remedy, slow-working it is true but effectual, brought about by the long lapse of time. You bid me reflect on good, forget evil.

                  <p>Why do we shirk the question, Epicurus, and why do we not confess that we mean by pleasure what you habitually say it is, when you have thrown off all sense of shame? Are these your words or not? For instance, in that book which embraces all your teaching (for I shall now play the part of translator, that no one may think I am inventing) you say this: “For my part I find no meaning which I can attach to what is termed good, if I take away from it the pleasures obtained by taste, if I take away the pleasures which come from listening to music, if I take away too the charm derived by the eyes from the sight of figures in movement,<ref n="275.2">2</ref> or other pleasures produced by any of the senses in the whole man. Nor indeed is it possible to make such a statement as this—that it is joy of the mind which is alone to be reckoned as a good; for I understand by a mind in a state of joy, that it is so, when it has the hope of all the pleasures I have named—that is to say the hope that nature will be free to enjoy them without any blending of pain.”</p>

Is it possible to be more self-contradictory?

For we have on the tip of our tongues as a rule the words “nothing should seem unexpected.” But how will the burden of loss be more endurable for the man who has recognized that something of the kind must happen to a human being? For this way of speaking takes nothing from the actual sum of evil; all it does is to suggest that nothing has taken place which should not have been expected. And yet such a mode of speaking is not without effect in imparting comfort; I should rather be inclined to think it had very great effect. Therefore such things as are unexpected do not have enough influence to account for all distress that arises; for the shock they cause is perhaps heavier, but they do not make the occurrences seem more serious; they seem more serious because their impression is still fresh, not because of their suddenness.</p>

He said that this way of speaking had no bearing at all on the alleviation of distress; for he argued that the actual call to grief came from the fact that we were subject to a necessity so cruel. For Euripides' way of speaking was suited to bring comfort to ill-disposed people from the recital of the evils of others. My view, however, is far different. For the thought that the lot of man must be endured prevents us from contending as it were against God and also warns us that we are human: and this reflection is a great relief to sorrow, and the detailed instances cited are not given to delight the mind of the ill-natured, but to lead the mourner to think that he must bear the burdens which he sees many men have borne in a spirit of quiet restraint.</p>

And yet it seems to me Cleanthes has not quite seen that the feeling of distress can sometimes arise from the very thing which he himself admits to be the worst evil of all. For what shall we say—seeing that Socrates, as we are told, convinced Alcibiades that he was in no true sense a man and that there was no difference, for all his high position, between him and any poor porter, whereupon Alcibiades was much distressed and implored Socrates with tears to teach him virtue and drive baseness away,—what shall we say, Cleanthes?

<note n="319.1">This story is not in Plato. It is given in Augustine C.D. XIV. 8. Socrates showed Alcibiades that he was wretched because of his folly. Alcibiades was distressed because he was not what he ought to have been, i.e. was base, which Cleanthes says is the worst of all evils. Cleanthes can only say that the "wise man "is free from evil and cannot feel distress or sorrow: Lyco says that distress is occasioned by trifles. What can either of them do for Alcibiades? Is his distress real or not? Is it or is it not due to "evil"? To St. Augustine it is sorrow (tristitia), akin to the "godly sorrow "of 2 Cor. 7. 10, cf. § 7.

Your statement referred to the wise man who cannot think that there is any evil where there is no disgrace, or else thinks the evil so insignificant that it is overwhelmed by wisdom and is scarcely visible; for the wise man does not call in any imaginary belief to buttress distress, or think it right to let himself be cruelly tortured and weakened by sorrow, as he thinks nothing can be more degraded.

The study of wisdom, at any rate to the extent I have shown, was of long standing among our countrymen, but nevertheless I do not find any I can expressly call philosophers before the days of Laelius and Scipio. In their young days I see that Diogenes the Stoic and Carneades of the Academy were sent as ambassadors<ref n="333.1">1</ref> to the senate by the Athenians, and as these men had never taken any part in public life and one of them was a native of Cyrene and the other of Babylon, they would assuredly never have been called out of their lecture rooms or chosen for this office, unless the study of philosophy had been familiar to some of the leading Romans of that day. But though they committed other subjects to writing, some the rules of civil law, some their speeches, some the memorials of their ancestors, yet this the most fruitful of all arts, which teaches the way of right living, they promoted more by their lives than by their writings.</p>

Now to come to the analogy of health and to make use at last of this comparison (but more sparingly than is the way of the Stoics), as some men are more prone to some diseases and other men to others, and so we say of certain people that they are liable to catch cold, certain others to attacks of colic, not because they are suffering at the moment but because they frequently do so; in the same way some men are prone to fear, others to another disorder, in consequence of which in some cases we speak of an anxious temper and hence of anxious people, in other cases of irascibility which is different from anger, and it is one thing to be irascible, another thing to be angry, just as an anxious temper is different from feeling anxiety; for not all men who are at times anxious are of an anxious temper, nor are those who have an anxious temper always feeling anxious, just as for instance there is a difference between intoxication and habitual drunkenness, and it is one thing to be a gallant and another thing to be in love. Moreover this proneness of some men to one disease and others to another is of wide application; for it applies to all disorders.</p>

This proneness then of each individual to his own peculiar disorder would on the analogy of the body be called sickness, provided it be understood as proneness to sickness. But in the case of what is good, because some men are better adapted to one sort of good and others to another, let it be named inclination; in the case of what is evil let it be named proneness so as to suggest slipping; in the case of what is neither good nor bad let it have the earlier name.</p>

Defectiveness,<ref n="357.2">2</ref> however, is a habit or a disposition which is throughout life inconsistent and out of harmony with itself.

        <note n="359.1">The meaning of this passage is difficult to follow. Cicero seems to be distinguishing between two states of moral defect, the one a "habit," the other a "disposition." Both are due to perversion of belief, but vicious "habit" means depravity, vicious " disposition means only inconsistency, sometimes more, sometimes less. A " disposition" by long indulgence can become a "habit." When Dr. Johnson was urged by Hannah More to take a little wine, "I can't take a little, child," he answered; "therefore I never touch it," for he did not intend the "disposition " to become a "habit." On the other hand Johnson declared himself" a hardened and shameless tea drinker," for "disposition" had been allowed to become "habit." Horace recognizes the distinction between the man who has the habit of vice and who rejoices in iniquity, and the man who has the "disposition to vice but is at war with himself, Sat.

Finally they do not approve of an orator unless he uses the prickles of irascibility, not merely in bringing an accusation but even in conducting a defence, and though the anger be not genuine, yet it should, they think, be feigned in language and gesture, that the delivery of the orator may kindle the anger of the hearer.

For instance, we see that distress is itself mitigated when we confront mourners with the weakness of an enervated soul, and when we praise the dignity and consistency of those who submit to the lot of mankind without chafing; and this usually happens with those who think such afflictions evil but nevertheless consider they should be endured with equanimity.

To think otherwise therefore is a deception to be removed, and a belief to be rejected, and just as where evil is expected the prospect must be met with endurance, so where good is expected the objects held to be momentous and delightful must be regarded in a calmer spirit. Besides there is this feature common to good and evil, that if it should be difficult at the moment to convince the sufferer that none of the things which disorder the soul is to be reckoned among good or evil, nevertheless different modes of treatment are applicable to different emotions, and the malicious must be reformed in one way, the rake in another, the worried again in another and the fearful in another.</p>

<p>A. It does not appear to me that virtue can be sufficient for leading a happy life. M.

No doubt you do and yet the question now before us is not the depth of your affection for him, but the view I have stated as it appears to me, and this I wish you to discuss. M. Do you really mean that virtue cannot be sufficient for leading a happy life? A. I do, absolutely. M. Tell me this, does virtue give sufficient aid for living rightly, honourably, praiseworthily, and in a word for leading a good life? A. Certainly it does. M. Can you then say either that the man who lives an evil life is not wretched, or that the man who, as you admit, leads a good life does not lead a happy one? A. Why should I not? for even in torture a man can live rightly, honourably, praiseworthily and for that reason lead a good life, provided only you understand the sense in which I now use the term good; for I mean living consistently, with dignity, wisdom, courage:</p>

For instance your troop of virtues, when laid upon the rack, bring before the eyes visions of majestic splendour, making it seem that happy life is on the point of hastening to them speedily and not suffering them to remain deserted by itself.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="14" subtype="section">
<p>When, however, one has led the soul away from the visions of that picture of the virtues to the truth of reality, there is left this bare question,—can anyone be happy as long as he is tormented? Let us therefore put this question now; as for the virtues, however, do not be afraid of their remonstrating and complaining that happy life has deserted them, for if there is no virtue without prudence, prudence by itself can see that not all good men are also happy, and recalls many memories of M. Atilius, Q. Caepio or Manius Aquilius,<ref n="p439.2">2</ref> and when happy life (if resolved to resort to visions rather than actual facts) attempts to pass to the rack, prudence in person restrains it and says that it has no partnership with pain and agony.</p>

<p>Because troubled movements and agitations<ref n="p441.1">1</ref> of the soul, roused and excited by ill-considered impulse, in scorn of all reason, leave no portion of happy life behind them.

Further, if the same man (and this happens frequently) is afraid of poverty, disgrace, dishonour, if he is afraid of infirmity, blindness, if lastly he is afraid of slavery (the frequent fate, not of individual men but powerful communities): can anyone be happy with such fears before him? </p>

Further, where we see a man passionately stirred with the madness of lust, desiring all things in a fury of unsatisfied longing, and the more copiously he drains the cup of pleasure wherever offered, the deeper and more consuming his thirst, would you not rightly pronounce him utterly wretched? Again, when a man is frivolously excited, and in a transport of empty delight and reckless extravagance, is he not all the more wretched, the happier his life appears in his own eyes? Therefore as such men are wretched, so on the contrary those are happy whom no fears alarm, no distresses corrode, no lusts inflame, no vain transports of delight dissolve in the melting lassitude of pleasure.

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>A. Well at any rate there can be no question of the one point-that those who have no fear, no worry, no covetousness, no transport of ungovernable delight are happy, and so I grant you this; moreover the other problem has already had a breach made in it, for the result of our previous discussions was that the wise man is free from all disturbance of soul. </p>

<p>M. Surely then the inquiry is finished, for the problem seems to have reached its solution. A. Almost so at any rate. M.

For geometricians, when they want to demonstrate some proposition, take for granted and proved anything in previous demonstrations which is germane to the subject; they only unravel the difficulty about which nothing has previously been written: philosophers collect together all that is applicable to any inquiry upon which they are engaged, even if it has all been thoroughly discussed elsewhere.

<p>But this nevertheless is not the way they go to work; for their books deal separately both with that which is right and with the highest good, and while from the nature of the good it is concluded that virtue implies sufficient power for leading a good life, none the less they deal separately with the converse; for every subject must be attacked with its own appropriate proofs and exhortations, particularly one so momentous.

For this was the way in which that leader of philosophy argued, that as was the disposition of each individual soul so was the man; and as was the man in himself so was his speech; moreover deeds resembled speech and life resembled deeds.

How beautiful the city, how richly provided with resources the State which he kept under the crushing weight of slavery! And yet we are told on the authority of trustworthy writers that while this man was exceedingly temperate in his way of life and showed untiring energy in the conduct of affairs, he was yet unscrupulous by nature and unjust and this means that in the eyes of all who have a clear insight into the truth he was necessarily supremely wretched.

In this way he had of his own choice, in order to gratify his unrighteous longing for despotism, almost shut himself up in prison. Nay too he went so far as to have his daughters taught the use of a razor that he might not put his neck at the mercy of a barber: accordingly the young princesses, reduced to the mean employment of drudges, shaved their father's hair and beard like miniature barbers; and all the same, when they were now older, he took the iron utensil out of the hands of these self-same girls and arranged for them to singe his hair and beard with red-hot walnut shells.</p>

Once when a certain acquaintance jestingly remarked, "Here at any rate is one to whom you certainly entrust your life," and the young man gave a smile, Dionysius had both executed, the one for having, as he held, pointed out the way to assassinate him, and the other for having greeted

             the remark with a smile; and the grief he felt for this act occasioned him greater distress than anything else in his life; for he had put to death the being he fondly loved.

On his admitting his desire to do so Dionysius had him seated on a couch of gold covered with beautiful woven tapestries embroidered with magnificent designs, and had several sideboards set out with richly chased gold and silver plate.

Dionysius seems (does he not?) to have avowed plainly that there was no happiness for the man who was perpetually menaced by some alarm. Moreover it was not even open to him to retrace his steps to the path of justice, to restore to his fellow citizens their freedom and their rights; for with the inconsiderateness of youth he had entangled himself in such errors and been guilty of such acts as made it impossible for him to be safe if he once began to be sane.</p>

He was in fact we hear an enthusiastic musician, a tragic poet too-how good, matters little ; for in this art, more than in others, it somehow happens that everyone finds his own work excellent; so far I have never known the poet (and I have been friends with Aquinius<ref n="488.2">2</ref>) who did not think himself the best; this is the way with them-"You are charmed with your work, I with mine"-but to come back to Dionysius, he denied himself all the

Who in all the world, who enjoys merely some degree of communion with the Muses, that is to say with liberal education and refinement, is there who would not choose to be the mathematician rather than the tyrant? If we inquire into their manner of life and employment we see that the mind of the one found its sustenance in the problems of scientific research and enjoyed the exercise of its ingenuity—and this is the one most delightful spiritual food-whilst the mind of the other dwelt on murder and outrage, and fear was in its company both by day and night. Come, compare Democritus, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras with Dionysius; what thrones, what resources will you put above the studies in which they found their delight?</p>

The good of such a mind then we must enjoy if we wish to be happy; but the good of the mind is virtue: therefore happy life is necessarily bound up with virtue.

In the first place he must be of outstanding intelligence; for virtue is not easily found to go with sluggish minds; secondly he must have an eager enthusiasm in the quest of truth; and from this springs the famous threefold progeny of the soul:<ref n="495.2">2</ref> one centred in the knowledge of the universe and the disentanglement of the secrets of nature; the second in distinguishing the things that should be sought out or avoided and in framing a rule of life; the third in judging what is the consequence to every premise, what is incompatible with it, and in this lies all refinement of argument and truth of judgment.</p>

        <p>For it is characteristic of the wise man to do nothing of which he can repent, nothing against his will, to do everything nobly, consistently, soberly, rightly, not to look forward to anything as if it were bound to come, to be astonished at no occurrence under the impression that its occurrence is unexpected and strange, to bring all things to the standard of his own judgment, to abide by his own decisions.

        <p>For the Stoics indeed the conclusion is easy, since they hold it the sovereign good to live according to nature and in harmony with nature, seeing that not only is this the wise man's settled duty but also it lies in his power, and so for them it follows necessarily that where a man has the chief good in his power, he also has the power of happy life: thus the life of the wise is rendered happy always. Now you know the utterances I think the most courageous about happy life and, at the point we now are unless you have something better to suggest—the truest as well.</p>

And since it appears that what you wish established is that, whatever the views held by warring sects about the limits<ref n="511.3">3</ref> of good and evil, nevertheless virtue is sufficient security for a happy life, a proposition which Carneades we are told habitually discussed<ref n="511.4">4</ref>-but he did so heatedly, as was his way in opposing the Stoics whom he was always most eager to refute, and against whose teaching his temper had fired up-for my part I shall treat the question calmly.

        <p>These then are the simple; the next are composite : three kinds of good, the highest of the soul, second of the body, third from the outside, as the Peripatetics,<ref n="513.3">3</ref> and the Old Academy are much the same ; Dinomachus and Callipho<ref n="513.4">4</ref> have coupled pleasure with rectitude; the Peripatetic Diodorus<ref n="513.5">5</ref> has joined, however, freedom from pain to rectitude. These are the views which have some solid support; for those of Aristo, Pyrrho, Herillus<ref n="513.6">6</ref> and some others have melted into air. Let us see what these can do for us, leaving on one side the Stoics whose view I think I have supported sufficiently already. And besides them the Peripatetic case is cleared up: apart from Theophrastus<ref n="513.7">7</ref> and any who follow him in a feeble dread and abhorrence of pain, it is allowable for the rest of them at any rate to do as they usually do, that is to say, exalt the dignity and grandeur of virtue. And when they have raised it to the heavens, in the way habitual to men who have a fine flow of eloquence, it is easy to trample all else under foot and despise it in comparison with virtue; for it is not allowable for men who say that renown must be sought at the cost of pain to deny that those who had attained their aim are happy; for though they are involved in certain evils, yet this term of happiness has a wide and far-reaching meaning.</p>

      <div type="textpart" n="87" subtype="section">

The opinion of Callipho and Diodorus will be the same, both of whom so warmly espouse rectitude that all things that have not got it must, they hold, be ranked a long way behind it. The rest do seem to be in somewhat of a strait, still they manage to swim their way out-Epicurus, Hieronymus, and any who are found to care to support poor deserted Carneades. For there is none of them who does not regard the soul as judge of the true good and join in instructing it to be able to despise such things as have only the semblance of good or evil.</p>
