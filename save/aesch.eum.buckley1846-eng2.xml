          <p>ORESTES comes to Delphi, pursued by the Erinnys of his mother 
            Clytemnestra. He is assured of Apollo's protection, and the scene 
            changes to Athens, where he undergoes his trial before the Areopagus, 
            now instituted by Minerva. On his acquittal, the Erinnys at first 
            threaten Athens with their wrath; but, on Minerva assuring them that 
            they shall ever be held in honor, they promise to confer all possible 
            blessings upon the Athenians.</p>

            having come, and Delphus who sways the helm<ref n="180.1">1</ref> of this land. 
            And Jove having made him inspired in mind with the art, 
            seats him here the fourth seer on the throne; and Loxias<ref n="180.2">2</ref> is 
            the prophet of his father Jove. To these deities I prelude my 
            address with prayers. And Pronaean Pallas is celebrated in 
            story. And I venerate the nymphs, where is the Corician 
            hollow grot, bird-loved, the haunt of Deities. Bromius too 
            possesses the realm, nor am I forgetful of it, from the time 
            that the god led on his Bacchants, having plotted death for 
            Pentheus like a hare; and invoking the fountains of Plistus, 
            and the might of Neptune, and perfect highest Jove. I then 
            sit down a prophetess on the throne; and now may the gods 
            grant that I obtain by far the best of former entrances, and if 
            any from the Greeks are present, let them advance having 
            obtained their turn by lot, as is the custom; for I prophesy 
            as the god may direct. (She enters the temple, and suddenly 
            returns.) Certainly things dreadful to tell, and dreadful to 
            behold with eyes have sent me back from the abodes of Loxias, 
            so that I neither have strength, nor can uplift my steps: but 
            I run with my hands, not by swiftness of legs; for an affrighted 
            old woman is nothing, like a child [in strength]. I creep, 
            indeed, towards the shrine of many garlands<ref n="180.3">3</ref>, and I behold at

            Orestes from afar at the banks of the Scamander, where she had fore­ 
            stalled foreign usurpation by taking possession of the country assigned as 
            a meed of honour to the Athenians and to herself by the Allied Greeks 
            before Troy. This is obviously the meaning of <quote xml:lang="grc">καταφθατουμένη</quote>, not 
            simply = <quote xml:lang="grc">κατακτωμένη</quote>, as Hesychius explains it, but = <quote xml:lang="grc">φθάνουσα 
            κατακτωμένη</quote>. It is well known, that from the time of Phryno and 
            Pittacus the Athenians were engaged in a dispute with the Lesbians

<note type="footnote">2 "These words cannot be understood without first of all bearing in 
            mind the original signification of <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅρκος</quote>; namely, the object whereby one 
            takes oath and binding on the conscience of the party taking oath. This 
            object is named to the challenged by the challenging party ; for instance, 
            the head of his child, or such and such gods. This is called giving an 
            <quote xml:lang="grc">ὅρκος</quote>. In the next place it must be kept in view, that an oath of this 
            kind, demanded of, or tendered to one party by the other, forms part of 
            the evidence. For that evidence required a challenge (<quote xml:lang="grc">πρόκλησις</quote>) and 
            the acceptation of it: both parties must be agreed to rest the decision of 
            the suit on the oath of one of the two parties, before the oath could be 
            admitted and stand as substantive evidenceThe meaning then 
            of what the Erinnys say is this: ‘Orestes will scarcely allow us to name 
            the oath which he shall take to attest his innocence, nor will he readily 
            consent to let the verdict depend upon our swearing to his guilt by what­ 
            ever oath he shall please to propose to us;’ and they are perfectly right 
            in their opinion. But Minerva very properly refuses to admit such a 
            mode of decision in this case, as being a mere show of the right, by which 
            she will not allow the wrong to gain the day." Muller, p. 177, sq. 
            The same elegant critic observes that Æschylus does not allude to the 
            customary oath used in the Court of Areopagus,—(on which the student 
            may compare the following passages of the Greek Orators : Demosth. in 
            Aristocr. p. 642; <bibl>Antiphon <title>de caede Herod.</title> p. 716</bibl> ; Lysias in Thcomn. 
            p. 352, 3 ; <bibl>Dinarchus in <title>Demosth.</title> p. 35, ed. Reiske</bibl>)—“because it has 
            no specific significance in this particular case; just as the oath of the 
            Areopagites to do strict justice is frequently referred to in the course of 
            the play, but is not actually administered in the theatre."</note>

            And I will tell you a great proof of these things. It is the 
            law that one whose hands are stained with murder be silent, 
            until by a man who cleanses from the impurity of blood, the 
            slaughter of a young victim have sprinkled him with gore. 
            Long since I have been thus purified at other abodes, both 
            with animals, and flowing streams: therefore, indeed. I dismiss 
            this your care. But what my race is, you shall quickly hear. 
            I am an Argive, and well do you know my father, Agamemnon<ref n="193.4">4</ref>, 
            leader of naval heroes; with whom you made the Trojan 
            city of Ilion no city. He perished not gloriously, having

            having wrapt him in artful toils, [and she herself] bore wit­ 
            ness to the murder of the bath. And I returning home, 
            having been an exile the time before this, slew her who gave 
            me birth, I will not deny it, with the vengeance of retributory 
            slaughter, on account of my dearest father. And of these 
            things Apollo is in common guilty, declaring sting-like woes 
            to my heart if I should not do some of these things to the 
            murderers. But do you, whether justly, or not, decide the

            the house of Justice falls. Some times fear, sitting in the

            with godless foot. For punishment will follow: a deci­ 
            sive end awaits. Therefore let every one honour duly the 
            sanctity of parents, and reverence the intercourse of hos­
