prophecy were so often caverns or mysterious chasms (e. g. Delphic

us (10.5. 5) that the Delphians affirmed their oracle to have originally
belonged to the Earth. And Prom. 209 we have Faîa and Θέμις pro-
phesying to Prometheus.

the received version: for Pindar says (quoted by Schol.) that 'Apollo by
force occupied Pytho:' and Eurip. (Iph. Τ. 1259) says, 'Apollo came
and took away Themis daughter of Earth from the divine oracles.'
But this savage and doubtless older story was not suitable to the

for Apollo. The Schol. mentions an interesting ceremonial, plainly a

Delphic inscriptions containing it (ΠΡΟΝΑΙA): but it seems to have
been afterwards corrupted into πρόνοια, the shape in which the name of
Athena at Delphi appears in Demosthenes (780), Aeschines (Ctes. 69),
and Pausanias (10.8.7). Some people suppose two Delphic Athenas,
προναία and πρόνοια: but this, though possible, is hardly likely. The

managed. The Schol. says, 'machines turned round shew the in-

407). This would suffice for ordinary cases, as in Ach. 407, where
Euripides is shewn in his study: or Ag. 1372, Cho. 973, where the
slayer standing over the victims is seen. But here we have the whole
interior: the ὀμφαλός, the seats, Orestes, Apollo, Hermes, and the
whole chorus of Furies (twelve or fifteen, see Introduction): and it is
difficult to see how they could all be got on to a moveable platform.
There is much to be said for Müller's view (Eum. 29) that here the
priestess speaks the first part of her speech, 1. 1-33, before the curtain,
which is afterwards drawn down and reveals the adytum.

[MSS. φονολειβῆ, clearly an error]
πάρεστι γᾶς ὀμφαλόν κ.τ.λ.
This stopping must be wrong, as the construction is very clumsy with
θρόνον in apposition to ὀμφαλόν, and the strophe which is very parallel
in sound and structure makes it practically certain that the stop is
at κάρα. We then have two alternatives :
(1) Το keep θρόνον, changing stop from πλέον το κάρα :
'Ruling utterly beyond the right
A throne dripping blood
From feet to head:
We may see the Earth's navel, etc.'
[φονολιβή θρόνον is a regular dochmiac, and may rightly correspond to
μεσολαβεῖ κέντρῳ, where the long kev- is an irrational syllable. So
for example O. Τ. 1315 δύσοῦρῖστὸν ōv corresponds to 1323 τυφλὸν
κῆδεῦῶν.
Even if syllabic correspondence were required, we might easily correct
το θρᾶνον Ahrens, θᾶκον Rauchenstein: but there is no need].
(2) To read with Herm. and others after Wakefield θρόμβον, and
suppose the second and third lines interjectory, by another speaker:
κρατοῦντες intransitive:
'Ruling utterly beyond the right:-

We may see, etc.'
The two lines would then be a vivid and bold picture of angry horror

But it is very difficult to believe that Aeschylus who makes the Furies
call upon the Fates (961) as 'our own sisters, righteous goddesses,'
and speak of them as apart from themselves (724), should here put one
for the other. It is better to consider (with Dind. Linw. Weil) that
the allusion is here, as more fully explained below (724), to Apollo
having allowed the Fates to be robbed by the rescue of Alkestis from
death. This explains the κάμοί γε next line, 'To us too' the Furies,

... σπέρματός τ᾽ ἀποφθοραὶ
παίδων κακοῦται χλοῦνις ἠδ᾽ ἀκρωνία.
The explanation turns on the meaning of χλοῦνις. (1) One of the
Schol. understands it to mean 'castration:' and this is supported by
Aristotle (Hist. An. 6. 28), who says distinctly τῶν δὲ ἀρρένων καὶ
ἀγρίων οἱ τομίαι μείζους γίγνονται καὶ χαλεπώτεροι, ὥσπερ καὶ Ὅμηρος
ἐποίησεν (11. 9. 539), Τρέψεν ἔπι χλούνην σῦν ἄγριον : which proves that
Arist. took χλούνης=τομίας: ΕEustathius (772), who quotes the authority
of Aeschylus, Aelian, and Aristotle for this int.: and Aeschylus himself,
who (Frag. 62) has χλούνης apparently meaning 'eunuch;' but (2) others
reply that Homer cannot have meant a σûς τομίας but the opposite :
and hence χλοῦνις = ' virility.' These retain κακοῦται and read ἀποφθορᾷ,
translating 'and by the destruction of the seed the virility of boys is
ruined.' So Dind. Pal. Weil.
In favour of (1) is the very strong evidence of Aristotle, backed
by Schol. and Eustathius, and further the run of the lines, which
consists of a heap of abstract nouns which would be very harshly
broken by a finished sentence. We must therefore assume κακοῦται
corrupt: though no satisfactory emendation has been suggested.
We may add that those who support (2) assume that Aeschylus
must have used the word in the Homeric sense: but it is quite possible
that he may have misused an old word, and made the same mistake
as Aristotle: and the evidence of Frag. 62 confirms this.

'To those mortals who light upon sinful deeds of blood,
To cling to them, until

ξυμπέσωσιν is suspected by some edd.: why, they ask, should
Furies pursue those whom murder 'falls in with, i. e. who are ac-
cidentally guilty of murder?
But the fact is that all through these lines there is an intentional
use of mild terms, giving (as so often) the effect of the deadliest
irony, and suggesting the grim exultant ferocity of the Furies. Thus,
besides ξυμπέσωσι, ‘befall,' for a deliberate murder, we have μάταιοι
(lit. 'vain,' 'foolish,') for wicked: ὁμαρτεῖν (lit. 'to attend on'), for
the relentless pursuit of the Furies: οὐκ ἄγαν ἐλεύθερος meaning he
is never quit of us.
Note the Epic usages: (1) τοῖσιν for relative, so, e. g. Ag. 526,

For the new deed of blood.'
The genitive will then be a genitive of the cause (like θράσους τοῦδ᾽ οὐκ

the more special gen. of the charge (like ἁλῶναι κλοπῆς, διώκειν φόνου, etc.).

<div type="textpart" subtype="commline" n="6">
<div type="textpart" subtype="comment"><p>Again an obscure passage. MSS. read :
σπευδόμεναι δ᾽ ἀφελεῖν τινὰ τάσδε μερίμνας
θεῶν δ᾽ ἀτέλειαν ἐμαῖσι λιταῖς ἐπικραίνειν
μηδ᾽ ἐς ἄγκρισιν ἐλθεῖν·
Ζεὺς γὰρ αἱματοσταγὲς ἀξιόμισον ἔθνος τόδε λέσχας
ἃς ἀπηξιώσατο.
And then should follow what has got displaced in the MSS.:
μάλα γὰρ οὖν ἁλομένα, κ.τ.λ.
Where the general drift seems to be: ‘[I pursue the guilty] and
am eager to relieve another (the gods) of this charge, and set the
gods free, and prevent the crime from coming to trial-for Zeus has
banished the guilty from his sight, etc.'
This seems to make a fair sense, and it is best with most editors
to suppose the nom. pendens σπευδόμεναι to be taken up again by
μάλα γὰρ οὖν, so that the sentence is only grammatically completed
when we reach καταφέρω.
[This anacoluthon is rather harsh: Wecklein and Kirchhoff take
Döderlein's suggestion σπεύδομεν αΐδ', 'we here are eager.' But the
phrase is then abrupt and unnatural.]
The points that remain are:
(1) 362 ἐμαῖσι λιταῖς, which, if right, must be referred to the
prayer of the Eumenides to Apollo not to interfere. But the passage is
too general to refer specially to Orestes, though he is of course in
their minds. So that perhaps ἐμαῖς μελέταις is better, and by my
labour to set the gods free' (lit. 'to bring about the freedom or
immunity of the gods,' i. e. freedom from the duty of punishing the
criminal).
(2) 363 μηδ' εἰς ἄγκρισιν ἐλθεῖν: i. e. to take the guilty into my
own hands and prevent the matter from being tried by the gods;-
the very thing they feared was going to be done with Orestes. ἄγκρισις
or ἀνάκρισις is the technical term for the preliminary investigation by
a magistrate.
(3) 'Bloody hateful race,' i.e. as Schol. explains, 'the race of
murderers:' the whole passage from 1. 348 being a general description of
the office of the Furies and their relation to the gods.
[H. P. and others refer ἔθνοs to Furies: but they would hardly
call themselves ἀξιώμισον.]
The whole passage may then be translated as follows:
'And eager to lighten another of this charge,
And by our care to set free the gods,
And that [it] come not to trial:
For with this bloody hateful troop
Zeus deigns not to commune.'

The Schol. tells us there was a reference here to a dispute between
Athens and Mitylene for Sigeum in the Troad, settled in favour of M. by
single combat. According to Herodotus (5. 95) the dispute was an
old one: the struggle began about 606, and was settled by mediation of

Periander, who gave Sigeum to Athens. But evidently the dispute went
on: for Herodotus tells us in the same chapter that Peisistratos (presum-

manner to refer to this event in a bold and imaginative way, by
making the land 'given to Athena as choice offering of the spoil by the

Athena wears it also, as well as Zeus, in Homer. The word probably

χρόνον 1. 572, αἰανὴς νόσος 11. 479, 941. On the other hand, Hesychius
(Alexandrine grammarian and lexicographer, 4th century, A.D.) quotes
a form alavós, usually read in Soph. El. 506 ἔμολες αἰανή. In Soph.

Μ. ἥμισυς λόγου is regular Attic use (as well as λόγος): τῇ ἡμισέᾳ τῆς

1. 429 (The correction θέλοι for θέλει is almost necessary, as otherwise
it would seem as if the proposal had been made to Orestes.) The
reference in this line, he would take no oath, nor challenge us to swear,'
is to the custom of the ἀνάκρισις or preliminary investigation of causes
at Athens, before a magistrate: at this all the evidence was produced;
and the first thing was for the injured party to swear (προωμοσία) he had
suffered, the defendant to swear (ἀνθωμοσία) he was innocent.
These oaths, say the Chorus, are impossible here: Orestes will not deny
his guilt: he will neither ask us to swear (δοῦναι) nor swear when we ask
him (δέξασθαι). The whole of this passage is intended to correspond
in a general way to the ἀνάκρισις: after hearing the preliminary state-
ment of either party, Athena refers the whole case to the formal judgment
of the Areiopagos.

<div type="textpart" subtype="comment"><p>A passage of well-known difficulty. The MSS. reading
(with slight corrections, see critical notes) is substantially the fol-
lowing:
ἀπὸ στρατείας γάρ νιν ἠμποληκότα
τὰ πλεῖστ᾽ ἄμεινον εὔφροσιν δεδεγμένη
δροίτῃ περῶντι λουτρὰ κἀπὶ τέρματι
φᾶρος παρεσκήνωσεν, ἐν δ᾽ ἀτέρμονι
κόπτει πεδήσασ᾽ ἄνδρα δαιδάλῳ πέπλῳ·
which it is possible to translate, as follows:
'For him from the wars (returning) having dealt
In most things prosperously, she welcomed with kindly words,
And over the bath, as he stepped from the water, and on the edge,
She threw a cloak for covering, and entangling her lord
In a broidered robe inextricable, she smote him...'
This makes good sense, and is in substance no doubt what the
poet meant. But several things are at least suspicious: ἠμποληκότα
τὰ πλεῖστ᾽ ἄμειvov is a harsh phrase, even if we justify the rather flat
τὰ πλεῖστα and the comparative ἄμειvov by supposing an intentional
understatement: εὔφροσιν without substantive is very harsh, and is
hardly supported by the Homeric κερτομίοισιν and μειλιχίοισιν which
are special idioms: δροίτῃ governed by παρεσκήνωσε, and λουτρά
separate from it, is clumsy: κἀπὶ τέρματι is not smooth, and is sus-
piciously like ἀτέρμονι in the line below: finally most of the MSS.
and Schol. read περεσκήνωσεν, for περιεσ-, unexampled in Attic.
Corruption is almost certain: but as sense can be made, and no
suggestions are really satisfactory¹, it is best to leave it.

of the Athenian dicasteries: it is part of the poet's purpose to repre-
sent the court and all its customs as of ancient and divine institu-
tion.
[The question has been much discussed whether Athena's vote is
counted among the ballots, or is the casting vote; some even maintain-
ing that she does not vote at all.
At first sight it would appear that Athena votes (1. 735), that the votes
are counted (1. 742), and that with Athena's the votes are equal.
But this would make the court an odd number: the majority in the
judges against Orestes; and Athena interfering to turn a majority into
a minority:-all of which are very unlikely, and spoil the impressive
symbolism of the vote of the goddess. This, as Müller (Eum. Append.)
has pointed out, is as follows: The human justice is divided about the
cause: the guilt of Orestes, the guilt of Klyt. balance: it is the goddess
who gives the casting vote. Thus the rule that 'equal votes acquit' is
finely and imaginatively explained: when the earthly ψῆφοι are equal
there is an unseen and divine vote for mercy.
This could easily and simply be brought out in the action: the other
judges get up and drop their pebbles in, Athena holds hers in her hand
until the counting.]

other ἄκυρος: each voter had a black and a white pebble; his vote
was counted, according as the pebble he dropped into the κύριος
was white or black, for acquittal or condemnation. The second or
'inoperative' urn was to get rid of the other pebble, that there might
be no clue to the way he had voted.
Another method was by an urn of acquittal, and an urn of condem-
nation: but this would require only counting, no διαίρεσις.

11. 932, 933. The MSS. read
ὁ δὲ μὴ κύρσας βαρέων τούτων
οὐκ οἶδεν ὅθεν πληγαὶ βιότου.
Now τούτων here must refer to the Furies, as αὗται above and τάσδε
below: and consequently βαρέων must be wrong, as (1) it is the wrong
gender: (2) even if we suppose (with D.) a fem. form βαρεῶν, it clearly
is the wrong sense. What Aeschylus means to say is, 'He who incurs
the wrath of the Furies meets with unexpected calamity: the sins of his
fathers bring him into their power.
We must take therefore some emendation like ἱλαρῶν (Weil.), χαροπῶν
(Weck.), τῶνδ᾽ εὐμενέων (Hart.): of which I have preferred the former.
βαρέων will perhaps have arisen from confusion of β- and ix-: or per-
haps from a gloss. Another question arises about the metre. Hermann,
followed by most edd. (Lachm. Franz. Pal. Hart. Merkel. Weil.), has
assumed that Athena's anapaestic stanzas, which alternate with the
lyrics, correspond. There are five such stanzas: the three middle ones
(at 11. 949, 968, 988) are all the same length: and the first and the last
would be exactly equal, if after βιύτου we read some words like
προσέπαισαν (H.). The practice is not uniform: thus in the κομμός in
the Choephoroi the anapaestic alternating stanzas do not correspond,
though roughly about the same length: on the other hand in Aga-
memnon (11. 1448-1577) the anapaests do correspond.

<pb n="54"/>

It is on the whole more probable that the latter is the case here: and
I have accordingly adopted H.'ς προσέπαισαν.
The sense then is, 'He who finds them not propitious is stricken
with calamities he knows not whence:' and μὴ ἱλαρῶν κύρσας is really a
euphemism for 'offended.'

'pass its bounds' by growing.
The general sense is plain, 'No blight come near'; and perhaps we
might accept Wecklein's very ingenious λοπῶν for τύπων: ‘... killing

I.
LINES 358-9, and 369-70.
In the MSS. we have 358-9 κρατερὸν ὄνθ᾽ ὁμοίως
μαυροῦμεν ὕφ' (or ἐφ᾿) αἵματος νέου,
and 369-70 σφαλερὰ τανυδρόμοις
κῶλα δύσφορον ἄταν.
As usual, where metrical correspondence so completely fails that even
the metrical scheme is uncertain, there is a vast mass of suggestions,
most of which are too far from the original either in metre or letters
to have a chance of being acceptable, to say nothing of their intrinsic
infelicity.
The Schol. on 358 says διὰ τὸ νέον αἷμα. τοῦ νεωστὶ εἰργασμένου
ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. This goes far to prove that he read αἵματος νέου (whether
with or without ὑπύ) and explained it 'by reason of the new deed of
blood,' i. e. Orestes' murder of his mother.
On 369 the Schol. clearly has the MSS. reading, but he gives two
interpretations, one making κῶλα apposition to ποδὸς ἀκμάν (as is no
doubt right), and the other making the last two lines a new sentence.
The two best suggestions are Weil's, which I have adopted in the
text, and Paley's.
1. Paley reads 358 κρατερὸν ὄντα *περ ὅμως
μαυροῦμεν *νέον αἷμα [from an old suggestion of
Hermann's],
and 369 σφαλερὰ * καὶ τανυδρόμοις
κῶλα, δύσφορον ἄταν.
Understanding the first passage thus: '[Pursuing after him] though
he be mighty, we waste away the new blood stain,' i.e. we persecute
him till in time the murder stain grows faint, as Orestes says (ἀμβλὺν
ἤδη 238, and βρίζει γὰρ αἷμα καὶ μαραίνεται 280).
This makes a fairly good sense, but is open to the following
objections:-
(1) That the MS. reading ὕφ᾽ αἵματος νέου and the Schol. are
completely unaccounted for. One hardly sees how νέον αίμα could
have got so corrupted.
(2) That the Furies would certainly not say that they 'wore
away' the stain of blood, though Orestes might naturally use such a

<pb n="59"/>
APPENDICES.
plea. The very point of the Furies' exultation all through is that
there is no expiation, even in Hades: 'though he fly under the earth
he never is free' 175: 'in death he is not over free' 346: and their
office is 'a rugged path for dead and living alike' 387.
2. Weil's reading 358 κρατερὸν ὄνθ᾽ ὅμως ἀμαυρ-
οῦμεν αἵματος νέου,
369 σφαλερὰ τανυδρόμοις * ὅμως
κῶλα δύσφορον * μάταν,
has these advantages on the other hand :
(1) The gen. αἵματος is kept; and the Scholiast's note is accounted
for: indeed, better accounted for than if the MSS. ὑπό were retained,
as then there would be no need of a comment on so easy a phrase.
(2) ὅμως in 362 is better than καί, as it would easily drop out after
-όμοις of the word before.
(3) μάταν is a very easy alteration, since the previous word δύσφορον
ends in -v.
(4) The trochaic metre is peculiarly characteristic of this scheme;
see lines 331, 332, 333, 354, 366, 376, 380, 388, 396.
Of the other suggestions perhaps the best is one of that usually
reckless emendator Burges, who reads μαυροῦμεν νεόαιμον, 'we waste
him away stained with new blood. This would account for the first
Schol. But there is no trace of the word νεόαιμος.
II.
The relation of the Medicean Group of MSS. to the
Venetian Group.
THE question whether the three MSS. which are called above the
Venetian group, i.e. Flo. Farn. Ven. (see Introduction, p. 26) have
authority independent of the Medicean is obviously important for
the purposes of text criticism. We will call the Medicean M, and the
Venetian group FFV.
It is clear that there are four cases of error which bear upon the
argument:-
(1) Where FFV have the same corruption as M.
(2) Where FFV differ from M and both are wrong.
(3) Where M is right and FFV wrong.
(4) Where M is wrong and FFV right.
It is also clear that if FFV have independent authority, i.e. if they
do not spring either from M or a not remote ancestor of M, we should
expect to find (4) relatively considerable. If (4) were found to con-

sist of a few trivial cases, and (1) were numerous and important,
then the conclusion would be that FFV were not independent, but
that the better readings were due to emendation.
That the fact is so is tolerably clear from the following tables :-
(1) M wrong, FFV wrong: error the same.

From the number and character of the errors in (1) and the very
obvious and trifling corrections in (4) we should infer that FFV were
not independent of M: while (2) and (3) would show that FFV were
rather carelessly copied and unskilfully emended.
The evidence is of the same character in the other plays: but the
Eumenides alone is sufficient to make the conclusion highly probable.
