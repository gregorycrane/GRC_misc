 M. TULLIUS CICERO'S TUSCULAN DISPUTATIONS BOOK I n n
 
 
 ON a las securing a comple e or a any ra e a considerable release rom he oils o ad ocacy¹ and rom my sena orial du ies, I ha e once more—chie ly, Bru us, on your encouragemen —re urned o hose s udies, which, hough s ored in memory, had been pu aside hrough circums ances, and are now re i ed a er a long in er al o neglec . My iew was ha , inasmuch as he sys em and me hod o ins ruc ion in all he ar s which ha e a bearing upon he righ conduc o li e is bound up wi h he s udy o wisdom which goes by he name o philosophy, i was incumben on me o hrow ligh upon ha s udy by a work in he La in ongue; no ha philosophy could no be learn rom Greek wri ers and eachers, bu i has always been my con ic ion ha our coun rymen ha e shown more wisdom e erywhere han he Greeks, ei her in making disco eries or hemsel es, or else in impro ing upon wha hey had recei ed rom Greece—in such subjec s a leas as hey had judged wor hy o he de o ion o heir e or s.² n n
 n n
 
 For morali y, rules o li e, amily and household economy are surely main ained by us in a be er and more digni ied way; and beyond ques ion
 n
 our ances ors ha e adop ed be er regula ions and laws han o hers in direc ing he policy o go ernmen . Wha shall I say o he ar o war? In his sphere our coun rymen ha e pro ed heir superiori y by alour as well as in an e en grea er degree by discipline. When we come o na ural gi s apar rom book-learning hey are abo e comparison wi h he Greeks or any o her people. Where has such earnes ness, where such irmness, grea ness o soul, hones y, loyal y, where has such surpassing meri in e ery ield been ound in any o mankind o jus i y comparison wi h our ances ors? n n
 n n
 
 
 In learning Greece surpassed us and in all branches o li era ure, and ic ory was easy where here was no con es . For while wi h he Greeks he poe s are he oldes li erary class, seeing ha Homer and Hesiod li ed be ore he ounda ion o Rome and Archilochus¹ li ed in he reign o Romulus, poe ry came o us a a la er da e. Abou i e hundred and en years a er he ounda ion o Rome Li ius produced a play in he consulship o C. Claudius, son o Caecus, and M. Tudi anus in he year be ore he bir h o Ennius, who was older han Plau us and Nae ius.² n n
 n n
 
 A a la e da e hen were poe s ei her known or welcomed by our coun rymen. Though i is s a ed in he Origines
 ³ ha gues s were in he habi o singing a banque s in honour o he ir ues o amous men o he playing o a piper, ye a speech o Ca o's shows ha his kind o alen was no held in respec , or in i he censured M. Nobilior or ha ing, as he declares, aken poe s in his sui e o his pro ince. I is, as we know, ma er o ac ha Nobilior when consul had aken Ennius⁴ o Ae olia. The ligh er hen he es eem in which poe ry was
 n
 held, he less was he de o ion paid o i , and ye such wri ers as ha e by ir ue o grea na ural endowmen s pro ed hemsel es poe s, ha e no ailed o be a wor hy ma ch or he glory o he Greeks. Or do we suppose ha i Fabius Pic or, a man o noble amily, had managed o win ame or his pain ing,¹ we oo should no ha e had many a Polycli us² and Parrhasius? Public es eem is he nurse o he ar s, and all men are ired o applica ion by ame, whils hose pursui s which mee wi h general disappro al, always lie neglec ed. The Greeks held ha he proo o he highes educa ion was ound in ins rumen al and ocal music: hus i is ha Epaminondas, o my mind he leading man in Greek his ory, was, we are old, an accomplished singer o he accompanimen o he harp, whils Themis ocles, o go back many years pre iously, was held o show a lack o cul ure in re using o play he lyre a banque s. Musicians accordingly lourished in Greece; e eryone would learn music, and he man who was unacquain ed wi h he ar was no regarded as comple ely educa ed. n n
 n n
 
 Wi h he Greeks geome ry was regarded wi h he u mos respec , and consequen ly none were held in grea er honour han ma hema icians, bu we Romans ha e res ric ed his ar o he prac ical purposes o measuring and reckoning. n n
 
 Bu on he o her hand we speedily welcomed he ora or—no a irs he cul i a ed bu he ready speaker and a a la er da e he cul i a ed ora or. For Galba, A ricanus and Laelius were, as radi ion has old us, well-read, while Ca o who preceded hem was a diligen s uden ; nex came Lepidus, Carbo and he Gracchi;³ a er hem up o our day
 n
 ora ors o such power ha li le or no ground a all was yielded in a our o he Greeks. Philosophy has lain neglec ed o his day, and La in li era ure has hrown no ligh upon i : i mus be illumina ed and exal ed by us, so ha , i in he ac i e business o li e I ha e been o ser ice o my coun rymen, I may also, i I can, be o ser ice o hem in my leisure. n n
 n n
 
 And I mus exer mysel all he more ac i ely because here are now, i is said, a number o books in La in¹ wri en wi hou due care by wri ers who wi h all heir meri s are ye insu icien ly equipped. Now i is possible or an au hor o hold righ iews and ye be unable o express hem in a polished s yle; bu o commi one's re lec ions o wri ing, wi hou being able o arrange or express hem clearly or a rac he reader by some sor o charm, indica es a man who makes an unpardonable misuse o leisure and his pen. The resul is ha such wri ers read heir own books hemsel es along wi h heir own circle, and none o hem reaches any wider public han ha which wishes o ha e he same pri ilege o scribbling ex ended o i sel . For his reason, i by my assidui y I ha e won or our coun rymen some measure o ora orical renown, I shall wi h ar grea er en husiasm lay bare he springs o philosophy, which were also he source rom which hose earlier e or s o mine ook heir rise. n n
 n n
 
 
 Bu jus as Aris o le,² a man o supreme genius, knowledge and er ili y o speech, under he s imulus o he ame o he rhe orician Isocra es,³ began like him o each he young o speak and combine
 n
 wisdom wi h eloquence, similarly i is my design no o lay aside my early de o ion o he ar o expression, bu o employ i in his grander and more rui ul ar : or i has e er been my con ic ion ha philosophy in i s inished orm enjoys he power o rea ing he grea es problems wi h adequa e ulness and in an a rac i e s yle. To his endea our I de o ed mysel wi h such energy ha I ac ually reached he poin o en uring o gi e disser a ions in he manner o he Greeks: or ins ance, recen ly a er your depar ure, as here were a number o close riends s aying wi h me, I a emp ed in my house a Tusculum o see wha I could do in his sor o exercise: or jus as in my you h I used o be cons an ly declaiming speeches or he cour s—and no one e er did so longer—so his is now a declama ion¹ o my old age. I called upon my riends o pu orward any subjec which any o hem wished o hear discussed, and his I deba ed ei her as I sa or walked abou . n n
 n n
 
 The resul is ha I ha e pu oge her in o i e books he disser a ions, as he Greeks erm hem, o as many days. The procedure was ha , a er he would-be lis ener had expressed his iew, I opposed i . This, as you know, is he old Socra ic me hod o arguing agains your ad ersary's posi ion; or Socra es hough ha in his way he probable ru h was mos readily disco ered; bu in order ha he course o our discussions may be more con enien ly ollowed I shall pu hem be ore you in he orm o a deba e and no in narra i e orm.

 M. n n ...dead or o hose who ha e o die? n n
 
 A. n n To bo h. n n
 
 M. n n As i is an e il i is here ore wre chedness. n n
 
 A. n n Cer ainly. n n
 
 M. n n Then hose whose lo i has already been o die and hose whose lo i is o be are wre ched. n n
 
 A. n n I hink so. n n
 
 M. n n There is no one hen who is no wre ched. n n
 
 A. n n Absolu ely no one. n n
 
 M. n n And in ac , i you wish o be consis en , e eryone who has been born or will be born is no only wre ched bu always wre ched as well. For i your meaning were ha only hose who had o die were wre ched, you would make an excep ion o no li ing person— or all ha e o die—s ill here would ha e been an end o wre chedness in dea h; seeing howe er ha he dead oo are wre ched we are born o e ernal wre chedness. For i mus ollow ha hose who died a hundred housand years ago are wre ched, or ra her e eryone who has been born. n n
 n n
 
 
 A. n n Tha is precisely my opinion. n n
 
 M. n n Tell me, pray! You are no erri ied, are you, by he s ories o hree-headed Cerberus in he lower world, he roar o Cocy us, he passage o Acheron, and "chin he wa er ouching, Tan alus worn ou wi h hirs "?1 Again, are you righ ened a he ale ha Sisyphus Rolle h he s one as he swea e h in oil ye ne er ad ance h? Or i may be also a he pi iless judges Minos and Rhadaman hus? A whose bar L. Crassus will no de end you nor M. An onius,2 nor—since he case will be ried be ore Greek judges—will you be able o engage Demos henes:3 you will ha e o plead your cause in person be ore a as audience. From such prospec s i may be you shrink and here ore consider dea h an unending e il. n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 
 A. n n Do you suppose me so crazy as o belie e such ales? n n
 
 M. n n You don' belie e hem rue? n n
 
 A. n n Cer ainly no . n n
 
 M. n n My word! ha 's a sad s ory. n n
 
 A. n n Why so? n n
 
 M. n n Because I could ha e been so eloquen in speaking agains such ales. n n
 n n
 
 
 A. n n Who could no on such a heme? Or wha rouble is here in pro ing he alsi y o hese hobgoblins o poe s and pain ers? n n
 
 M. n n And ye here are por ly olumes in which philosophers argue agains hese sel -same ables. n n
 
 A. n n They mus ha e li le o do; or who is so s upid as o be in luenced by such hings? n n
 
 M. n n I hen he wre ched are no in he lower world, here canno be any beings in he lower world a all. n n
 
 A. n n I am precisely o ha opinion. n n
 
 M. n n Where hen are hose whom you describe as wre ched, or wha is heir place o habi a ion? For i hey exis hey mus be somewhere. n n
 
 A. n n Well! I suppose hey are no anywhere. n n
 
 M. n n There ore you suppose hey ha e no exis ence ei her. n n
 
 A. n n Exac ly as you say; s ill I suppose hem o be wre ched or he simple reason ha hey do no exis a all. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n I mus say now I should ha e pre erred you o quail a Cerberus ra her han ind you making such rash s a emen s. n n
 
 A. n n How so, pray? n n
 
 M. n n You are a irming he exis ence o he being whose exis ence you deny. Where ha e your wi s gone? Once say a being who does no exis is miserable and you a irm his exis ence.1 n n
 
 A. n n I am no so dull as o say such a hing. n n
 
 M. n n Wha do you say hen? n n
 
 A. n n I say ha M. Crassus2 or example, because he los a noble or une by dea h, is wre ched, ha Cn. Pompeius3 is wre ched because he was robbed o a splendid repu a ion, in a word ha all are wre ched who qui he ligh o day. n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 M. n n You come back o he same posi ion, or hey mus exis i hey are wre ched: bu jus now you said ha he dead did no exis . Now i hey do no exis hey canno be any hing. There ore hey canno be wre ched ei her. n n
 
 A. n n I do no perhaps ye express my meaning. I hink ha he mere ac o no exis ing, when one has exis ed, is u er wre chedness. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n Wha ? more wre ched han ne er o ha e exis ed a all? I ollows ha hose who are no ye born are wre ched now, because hey do no exis , and ha we, i we are o be wre ched a er dea h, ha e been wre ched be ore we were born. My recollec ions pre ious o my bir h do no repor me wre ched: i you ha e a be er memory I should like o know wha your recollec ions o your s a e are. n n
 
 
 A. n n You are poking un a me as i my posi ion, ins ead o being ha hose who are dead are wre ched, were ha hose who are unborn are wre ched. n n
 
 M. n n You say hen hey exis . n n
 
 A. n n No so. I say hey are wre ched because hey do no exis , a er ha ing exis ed. n n
 
 M. n n Don' you see ha your s a emen s are sel -con radic ory? Wha can be more o a con radic ion han o say ha a being, who does no exis , no merely is wre ched bu is any hing a all? When you come ou o he Por a Capena and see he ombs o Cala inus, he Scipios, he Ser ilii, he Me elli,1 do you hink hem wre ched? n n
 
 A. n n You are pushing me hard wi h a erbal argumen , and so I shall hence- orward no say as be ore ha hey are wre ched, bu merely say "wre ched," or he simple reason ha hey do no exis . n n
 
 M. n n You do no say hen "M. Crassus is wre ched," bu simply "wre ched M. Crassus." n n
 
 A. n n Qui e so. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n As i any hing s a ed in a proposi ion o such a kind mus no necessarily
 n
 ei her be or no be. Ha e you no aken so much as a irs s ep in logic? This is an elemen ary lesson. E ery proposi ion— his is he word ha a he momen i has occurred o me o use or he erm ἀξίωμα: I shall employ ano her word la er i I can ind a be er—a proposi ion hen is a s a emen which is rue or alse: here ore when you say "wre ched Marcus Crassus," ei her you say "Marcus Crassus is wre ched," so ha i can be se led whe her he s a emen is rue or alse, or you say no hing a all.1 n n
 
 A. n n Well! I gran now ha he dead are no wre ched, seeing ha you orced me o admi ha hose who did no exis a all could no be wre ched ei her. Bu wha o his? Are no we he li ing wre ched, seeing ha we ha e o die? Wha sa is ac ion can here be in li ing, when day and nigh we ha e o re lec ha a his or ha momen we mus die? n n
 n n
 
 
 
 M. n n Now do you realise a all rom wha a load o misery you ha e ligh ened he lo o mankind? n n
 
 A. n n How do you mean? n n
 
 M. n n In his way: i dea h had been wre chedness e en or he dead, we should ha e been subjec in li e o an unlimi ed and e ernal condi ion o e il: as i is I see a goal, and when we ha e reached i here is no hing le o be so much a raid o . Bu you seem o me o agree wi h he aphorism o Epicharmus,2 who was, as one expec s in a Sicilian, a man o keen insigh and no wi hou as e. n n
 
 A. n n Wha aphorism? I am no acquain ed wi h i . n n
 
 M. n n I shall gi e i i I can in La in: you know I am no more in he habi o using Greek in speaking La in han o using La in in speaking Greek. n n
 
 A. n n Qui e righ . Bu wha , pray, is his aphorism o Epicharmus? n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 M. n n Dying I shun: o being dead I no hing reck.1 n n
 
 A. n n Now I recognise he Greek. Bu since you compelled me o admi ha he dead were no wre ched, go on i you can o make me hink ha o ha e o die is no wre chedness ei her. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n Surely ha is no serious under aking, I ha e grea er aims in iew. n n
 
 A. n n How no serious ma er? Or wha do you mean by he grea er aims you speak o ? n n
 
 M. n n Because, inasmuch as a er dea h here is no e il, dea h, which is a once succeeded by ime in which by your admission here is no e il, is no an e il ei her: i ollows ha o ha e o die is no an e il ei her, or i means ha ing o reach a condi ion which we admi is no an e il. n n
 
 A. n n Explain more ully, I beg; or your las remarks are somewha in rica e and compel me o agree be ore I am con inced. Bu wha do you mean by he grea er aims you ha e in iew? n n
 
 M. n n To show you i I can ha dea h is no merely no e il bu posi i ely a good. n n
 
 A. n n I do no ask so much as ha , all he same I am eager o hear i or hough you may no succeed in your wish, s ill you will succeed in showing ha dea h is no an e il. Bu I shall no in errup you: I wish o hear a con inuous speech. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n Wha ? I I pu a ques ion o you, will you make no reply? n n
 
 A. n n Tha would be discour eous: bu I pre er you o re rain rom ques ions excep where necessary. n n
 
 
 M. n n I shall humour you and explain wha you wish as bes I can, no howe er as i I were he Py hian Apollo2 making s a emen s o be regarded as cer ain and unal erable, bu ollowing ou a rain o probabili ies3 as one poor mor al ou o many. For ur her han likelihood n n

 I canno ge . Cer ain y will be or hose who say ha such hings can be known and who claim wisdom or hemsel es. n n
 
 A. n n Take he course you hink bes or our par we are ready o hear. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n We mus irs hen consider wha dea h, which seems o be a hing well known o e eryone, is in i sel . Some consider dea h he separa ion o he soul rom he body; some hink here is no such separa ion, bu ha soul and body perish oge her and he soul is annihila ed wi h he body. O hose who hink ha here is a separa ion o he soul some hold ha i is a once dispersed in space, o hers ha i sur i es a long ime, o hers ha i sur i es or e er. Fur her, as o wha he soul i sel is in i sel , or where i s place in us, or wha i s origin, here is much disagreemen . Some hink he soul is he ac ual hear , and so we ge he words "wi hou hear ," "wan ing hear " and "o one hear ," meaning "senseless," " eeble-minded" and "o one mind"; and he wise s a esman Nasica,1 wice consul, go he name o "Goodhear " or "Sagacious," and so oo 
 he man o ma chless hear , shrewd Aelius Sex us.2 n n
 n n
 
 Empedocles3 holds ha he soul is blood permea ing he hear : o hers hough ha a par icular par o he brain had claim o he primacy o soul; o hers do no regard he ac ual hear or a par icular por ion o he brain as being he soul, bu some o hem ha e said ha he hear is he local habi a ion o he soul, whils o hers place i in he brain; o hers howe er iden i y soul and brea h as we Romans
 n
 prac ically do— he name explains his,1 or we speak o "gi ing up he ghos " and "expiring" and o "spiri ed people" and "people o good spiri " and " o he bes o one's belie "; moreo er he ac ual word or "soul" has come rom he word or "brea h" in La in;—Zeno2 he S oic holds he soul o be ire. n n
 
 Now he iews I ha e men ioned, ha he soul is hear , brain, li e or ire are hose ordinarily held he remaining iews are as a rule peculiar o indi idual hinkers, jus as philosophers o old3 held indi idual iews long ago, bu neares in da e o our ime here was Aris oxenus,4 musician as well as philosopher, who held he soul o be a special uning-up o he na ural body analogous o ha which is called harmony in ocal and ins rumen al music; answering o he na ure and con orma ion o he whole body, ibra ions o di eren kinds are produced jus as sounds are in ocal music: n n
 n n
 
 his hinker has no gone ou side he limi s o his own ar , bu all he same he has made a con ribu ion o alue, he proper meaning o which had long be ore been plainly s a ed by Pla o.5 Xenocra es6 denied ha he soul had orm or any subs ance, bu said ha i was number, and he power o number, as had been held by Py hagoras7 long be ore, was he highes in na ure. His eacher Pla o imagined he soul o be o hree- old na ure;8 he so ereign par , ha is reason, he placed in he head as he ci adel, and he o her wo par s, anger and desire, he wished o be
 n
 subser ien , and hese he ixed in heir places, anger in he breas and desire below he diaphragm. n n
 n n
 
 On he o her hand Dicaearchus1 in he discussion, o which he scene is laid in Corin h and o which he gi es an accoun in hree books, in roduces a number o he learned men who ook par in he discussion as speakers in he irs book; in he o her wo he represen s Pherecra es, an old na i e o Ph hio is, descendan he says o Deucalion, as arguing ha he soul is wholly non-exis en and he name qui e meaningless, and ha he erms "animalia" and "animan es" deno ing "crea ures and plan s possessed o soul" are applied wi hou reason; nei her in man nor in beas is here a spiri ual or physical principle answering o soul, and all he capaci y we ha e o ac ion or sensa ion is uni ormly di used in all li ing bodies and canno be separa ed rom he body, seeing ha i has no separa e exis ence and ha here is no hing apar rom one single body ashioned in such a way ha i s ac i i y and power o sensa ion are due o he na ural combina ion o he par s. n n
 n n
 
 Aris o le, who ar excels e eryone—always wi h he excep ion o Pla o—in genius and indus ry, a er grasping he concep ion o he well-known our classes o elemen s2 which he held o be he origin o all hings, considers ha here is a special i h na ure rom which comes mind; or mind re lec s and oresees and learns and eaches and makes disco eries and remembers and a mul i ude o o her hings: mind lo es, ha es, descries, ears, eels pain and joy; hese and similar ac i i ies are o be ound, he hinks, in none o he our irs classes: he employs a i h
 n
 class wi hou a name and accordingly applies o he ac ual soul a new erm, ἐνδελέχεια,1 descrip i e o a sor o unin errup ed and perpe ual mo emen . n n
 n n
 
 
 These, unless I happen o ha e missed any, are pre y nearly he iews held abou he soul. There is, i is rue, Democri us,2 a man o undoub ed power, bu , as he makes he soul consis o minu e smoo h round bodies brough oge her in some sor o acciden al collision, le us pass him o er; or here is no hing which hinkers o his school canno cons ruc ou o a swarm o a oms. Which o hese iews is he rue one i is or a di ine being o de ermine: which is mos probable is a di icul ques ion. Are we in a our o deciding be ween hese iews or o going back o he subjec irs pu orward?3 n n
 
 A. n n My wish would be or bo h courses i i could be managed, bu i is a di icul ma er o combine he wo. There ore i , wi hou discussing hese ur her ques ions, we can ge ree rom he ear o dea h, le his be our aim; bu i ha is impossible, unless his problem o he na ure o he soul is irs unra elled, le us ake ha problem irs and he o her ques ion la er. n n

 For i he soul is he hear or blood or brain, hen assuredly, since i is ma erial, i will perish wi h he res o he body; i i is brea h i will perhaps be dispersed in space; i ire i will be quenched; i i is he harmony o Aris oxenus
 n
 i will anish away. Why speak o Dicaearchus, a hinker who says he soul is no hing a all? According o all hese iews no hing can apper ain o anyone a er dea h, or along wi h li e is los he power o sensa ion; moreo er here is no hing o make any sor o di erence o a being wi hou sensa ion. The iews o he res o he eachers o er he hope, i his happen o rejoice you, ha souls, on heir separa ion rom he body, ind heir way o hea en as o heir dwelling-place. n n
 
 A. n n I does rejoice me, and bes o all I should like his o be he ru h, and nex I should like, e en should i no pro e rue, o be persuaded o i all he same. n n
 
 M. n n Wha need ha e you hen o our help? We canno , can we, surpass Pla o in eloquence? Turn o er wi h a en ion he pages o his book upon he soul.1 You will be conscious o no ur her need. n n
 
 A. n n I ha e done so, be sure, and done so many imes; bu somehow I am sorry o ind ha I agree while reading, ye when I ha e laid he book aside and begin o re lec in my own mind upon he immor ali y o souls, all my pre ious sense o agreemen 2 slips away. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n Wha do you mean by his? do you gran ha souls ei her sur i e a er dea h, or else perish by he mere ac o dea h? n n
 
 A. n n I do gran i . n n
 
 M. n n Well hen—suppose hey sur i e? n n
 
 A. n n I admi ha hey are happy. n n
 
 M. n n Bu suppose hey perish? n n
 
 A. n n I admi ha hey are no wre ched, since by hypo hesis hey ha e no exis ence: or his admission we made a li le while back under he orce o your argumen . n n
 
 M. n n In wha sense hen or or wha reason do you say ha you consider dea h an e il, when i will ei her render us happy i our souls sur i e, or ree rom wre chedness i we are wi hou sensa ion? n n
 n n

 A. n n Show clearly, hen, i i is no roublesome, in he irs place, i you can, ha souls sur i e a er dea h, and nex , i you ail o es ablish his— or i is a di icul ma er—you are o pro e ha dea h is ree rom any e il. For he poin I am a raid o is precisely his, namely ha i be ound an e il, I do no say o be wi hou sensa ion, bu o ha e o ace he prospec o being wi hou i . n n
 
 M. n n As or au hori ies or ha iew which you wish o see es ablished, we can employ he highes , a poin which in all cases ough o ha e grea weigh and usually does so: and, o begin wi h, we can quo e all an iqui y which, i may be, had a clearer ision o he ru h in propor ion o i s nearness o i s origin and di ine ances ry. n n
 n n
 
 Accordingly we ind in hose men o old whom Ennius s yled he "ancien s"1 he ixed belie ha here is sensa ion in he s a e o dea h, and ha in qui ing li e man is no annihila ed so as o perish u erly his may be ga hered, among many o her ins ances, rom pon i ical law and he ri es o burial, or hese ri es would no ha e been so scrupulously obser ed by men o commanding abili y and heir pro ana ion orbidden under penal y o guil admi ing o no a onemen , i here had no been a ixed con ic ion in heir minds ha dea h was no an annihila ion obli era ing and des roying all hings, bu a kind o shi ing and changing o li e which o en ser ed as a guide o hea en or illus rious men and women, while or all o hers he ghos ly li e was kep underground, ye all he same sur i ed.2 n n

 Hence,
 n
 in he belie o our coun rymen, "in hea en Romulus li es e er wi h he gods," as Ennius wro e in obedience o radi ion, and wi h he Greeks here is he belie , which passed rom hem o us and on as ar as Ocean,1 ha Hercules is a grea and help ul god. From his belie i comes ha he son o Semele2 is held a god, and ha he same ale is old o he bre hren, sons o Tyndarus,3 who ha e no only helped he Romans o ic ory in ba le, bu ha e, so runs he rede, been messengers o ic ory as well. Wha ? Is no Ino daugh er o Cadmus, named by he Greeks Λευκοθέα, re erenced as Ma u a4 by our coun rymen? Wha ?

 Fur hermore, as his seems o be ad anced as he sures basis or our belie in he exis ence o gods, ha here is no race so unci ilized, no one in he world, we are old, so barbarous ha his mind has no inkling o a belie in gods:— rue i is ha many men ha e wrong no ions abou he gods, or his is usually he resul o a corrup na ure; ne er heless all men hink ha a di ine power and di ine na ure exis ,1 and ha is no he resul o human con erence or con en ion,2 i is no belie es ablished by regula ion or by s a u e, bu in e ery inquiry he unanimi y o he races o he world mus be regarded as a law o na ure.—Is here hen any being so cons i u ed ha he does no in he irs ins ance mourn or his dear ones because hey ha e been depri ed, as he hinks, o he com or s o li e?3 Do away wi h his belie and you will a once do away wi h mourning. I is no or his own discom or ha anyone grie es; men eel, i may be, sorrow and anguish; bu our cus omary melancholy wailing and weeping or grie come rom he hough ha he being we ha e lo ed is robbed o he com or s o li e and is sensible o heir loss; and his eeling o ours is due, no o any process o reasoning or ins ruc ion, bu o he promp ings o na ure. n n
 n n
 
 
 Bu he principal proo is ha na ure hersel gi es an unspoken judgmen on he immor ali y o souls, because all men are anxious and indeed deeply anxious abou wha will happen
 n
 a er dea h. "Trees does he sow o be o ser ice o he coming age," as S a ius1 says in he Synephebi, and wha no ion is in his mind excep ha e en succeeding ages are his concern? Shall hen a armer indus riously sow rees, no berry o which his eyes will e er see, and a grea man no sow he seed o laws, regula ions and public policy? The bege ing o children, he prolonga ion o a name, he adop ion o sons, he care ul prepara ion o wills, he ery burial monumen s, he epi aphs—wha meaning ha e hey excep ha we are hinking o he u ure as well as he presen ? n n
 n n
 
 And wha o his poin ? Can you doub ha properly our ideal o human na ure should be ormed rom he ines na ures we mee wi h? Wha be er ype o na ure here ore can we ind among human beings han he men who regard hemsel es as born in o he world o help and guard and preser e heir ellow-men? Hercules passed away o join he gods: he would ne er ha e so passed, unless in he course o his mor al li e he had buil or himsel he road he ra elled. Such ins ances are by now ime-worn and hallowed by he religious eeling o he world. n n

 Again, in his commonweal h o ours, wi h wha hough in heir minds do we suppose such an army o illus rious men ha e los heir li es or he commonweal h? Was i ha heir name should be res ric ed o he narrow limi s o heir li e? No one would e er ha e exposed himsel o dea h or his coun ry wi hou good hope o immor ali y. Themis ocles migh ha e led a quie li e, Epaminondas migh ha e done so, and no o quo e old- ime ins ances rom oreign his ory, I migh ha e done so; bu somehow i comes abou ha here is

 in men's minds a sor o deeply roo ed presen imen o u ure ages, and his eeling is s ronges and mos e iden in men o he grea es genius and he lo ies spiri . Take his eeling away and who would be such a madman as o pass his li e con inually in oil and peril? n n
 n n
 
 So ar, I am speaking o s a esmen, bu wha o poe s? Ha e hey no wish o become amous a er dea h? Wha hen is he meaning o he passage: Behold, my ellow-coun rymen, old Ennius' sculp ured ace! n n
 He old he glorious s ory o your a hers' migh y race? n n He demands he recompense o ame rom hose whose a hers he had rendered amous, and he same poe wri es:

 For why? rom lips o lips o men I pass and li ing keep. n n Bu why s op a he poe s? Ar is s wish o become amous a er dea h. Why else did Phidias inser his own likeness on he shield o Miner a in spi e o ha ing no righ o do so? Wha o our philosophers? Do hey no inscribe heir names upon he ac ual books hey wri e abou con emp o ame? n n
 n n
 
 Bu i uni ersal agreemen is he oice o na ure, and all men hroughou he world agree ha here is some hing apper aining o hose who ha e passed away rom li e, we oo are bound o hold he same opinion; and i we hink ha spiri s o ou s anding abili y or moral wor h ha e he cleares insigh in o he meaning

 n n
 
 
 Bu jus as i is by na ural ins inc ha we belie e in he exis ence o gods, and by he exercise o reason ha we learn o know heir na ure, so i is ha res ing upon he agreemen o all races o mankind we hink ha souls ha e an abiding li e, and i is by reason we mus learn heir place o abode and heir na ure. I is ignorance o his ha has in en ed he world below and he errors which no wi hou reason you appeared o despise. Bodies all in o he ground and are co ered wi h ear h, and his is he origin o our word or burial,1 and so men held ha he subsequen li e o he dead was passed underground; his belie resul ed in serious decep ions which poe s exaggera ed. n n
 n n
 
 The crowded concourse in he hea re wi h i s con ingen o silly women and children is s irred a he sound o he swelling s rain:
 
 Here ou o Acheron s raigh I gain by s eep and oilsome road, n n

 n
 which canno ake place and are no in elligible wi hou bodies; he reason was ha hey were unable o grasp he concep ion o souls li ing an independen li e and ried o ind or hem some sor o appearance and shape. This is he origin o Homer's νέκυια,1 his is he origin o he νεκυομαντεῖα2 which my riend Appius prac ised and o Lake A ernus in our neighbourhood,3

The soul hen is some one or o her o hese hings, so ha he mind, wi h all i s ac i i y, has no o lie buried in he hear or brain, or in he blood o Empedocles' heory. n n
 
 Bu as or Dicaearchus, along wi h his con emporary and ellow-pupil Aris oxenus, in spi e o heir undoub ed learning, le us ignore hem. The one appears ne er o ha e el so much as a pang a no no icing ha he had a soul; he o her is so pleased wi h his own unes ha he a emp s o bring hem in o philosophy as well. Bu we can recognize he melody arising ou o he dis ances in pi ch be ween sounds, and he di eren combina ion o hese sounds again produces ur her melodies; I ail o see, howe er, how he posi ion o he limbs
 n
 and he a i ude o he body, where here is no soul, is o produce melody. Bu le his musician, in spi e o his being, as indeed he was, ery learned, lea e philosophy in he hands o his mas er Aris o le, and or himsel con inue his singing lessons: or i is a good rule laid down in he well-known Greek saying: The ar which each man knows, in his le him employ himsel .1 n n

 Le us ur her u erly rejec he no ion o a soul made o indi isible smoo h round bodies brough in o acciden al concurrence, in spi e o he ac ha Democri us2 holds i o be hea ed and airy, ha is o he na ure o brea h. On he o her hand, i he soul, as we regard i , belongs o he our classes o elemen s o which all hings are said o consis , i consis s o kindled air,3 as I see is he iew which mos commends i sel o Panae ius,4 and such a soul necessarily s ri es o reach higher regions; or he wo ligh er classes ha e no downward endency and always seek he heigh s. Consequen ly i souls are dispersed in space, his akes place a a dis ance rom he ear h; i hey sur i e and preser e heir quali y, all he more reason or heir being carried o hea en and breaking heir way hrough and par ing asunder our dense and compac air which is neares o ear h; or he soul is ho er or, pre erably, more glowing han our air which I jus now described as dense and compac ; and his may be known rom he ac ha our bodies, which are ashioned rom he ear hy class o elemen s,5 are hea ed by he glow o he soul. n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 Add ha he soul comes o make i s escape all he more readily rom our air, which I ha e requen ly so named, and breaks i s way hrough, because here is no hing swi er han he soul: here is no sor o speed which can ma ch he speed o he soul. I i sur i es unadul era ed and unchanged in subs ance, i is o necessi y carried away so rapidly as o pierce and par asunder all his a mosphere o ours, in which clouds, s orms and winds collec because o he mois ure and mis produced by e apora ion rom he ear h. When he soul has passed his rac and reaches o and recognizes a subs ance resembling i s own, i s ops amongs he ires which are ormed o rare ied air and he modi ied glow o he sun and ceases o make higher ascen . For when i has reached condi ions o ligh ness and hea resembling i s own, i becomes qui e mo ionless, as hough in a s a e o equilibrium wi h i s surroundings, and hen, and no be ore, inds i s na ural home, when i has pierced o condi ions resembling i s own, and here, wi h all i s needs sa is ied, i will be nourished and main ained on he same ood which main ains and nourishes he s ars.1 n n
 n n
 
 And as i is he pricks o he lesh in our bodies which commonly enkindle us o almos all desires, and he lame is heigh ened by en y o all who possess wha we desire o possess, assuredly we shall be happy when we ha e le our bodies behind and are ree rom all desirings and en yings; and as happens now, when he burden o care is relaxed, we eel he wish or an objec o our obser a ion and a en ion, his will happen much more reely hen, and we shall de o e our whole being o s udy and examina ion, because na ure has plan ed in our
 n
 minds an insa iable longing o see ru h; and he more he ision o he borders only o he hea enly coun ry, o which we ha e come, renders easy he knowledge o hea enly condi ions, he more will our longing or knowledge be increased. n n

 For he beau y o ha ision e en here on ear h called in o being ha philosophy "o sires and grandsires,"1 as Theophras us erms i , which was irs kindled by longing or knowledge.

 For i now men hink i an achie emen when hey ha e seen Pon us and he amous narrows hrough which he essel passed named Argo, or her picked Argi e heroes once n nSailed ou o win he ram's brigh golden leece, n n2 or hose who saw he amous s rai s o Ocean, Where rom he Libyan shore he hungry wa e sundere h Europe, n n wha , pray, do we hink he panorama will be like when we shall be ree o embrace he whole ear h in our sur ey, i s si ua ion, shape, and circum erence, as well as bo h he dis ric s ha are habi able and hose again ha are le wholly uncul i a ed because o he iolence o cold or hea ? We do no e en now dis inguish wi h our eyes he hings we see; or here is no percep ion in he body, bu , as is augh no only by na ural philosophers bu also

 by he exper s o medicine, who ha e seen he proo s openly disclosed, here are, as i were, passages1 bored rom he sea o he soul o eye and ear and nose. O en, here ore, we are hindered by absorp ion in hough or by some a ack o sickness, and hough eyes and ears are open and uninjured, we nei her see nor hear, so ha i can be readily unders ood ha i is he soul which bo h sees and hears,2 and no hose par s o us which ser e as windows o he soul, and ye he mind can percei e no hing hrough hem, unless i is ac i e and a en i e.

For in our presen s a e, al hough he aper ures which, as has been said, are open rom he body o he soul, ha e been ashioned by na ure wi h cunning workmanship, ye hey are in a manner enced in wi h a compound o ear hy par icles: when, howe er, here shall be soul and no hing else, no physical barrier will hinder i s percep ion o he rue na ure o e ery hing. n n

 Did he occasion demand, one migh speak a any leng h on he number, arie y and magni ude o he wondrous sigh s he soul will ha e be ore i in hea enly places. Indeed on re lec ing o er hem I o en ind mysel wondering a he ex ra agance o some philosophers who mar el a na ural science,
 n
 and in he excess o heir joy render hanks o i s disco erer and ounder and do re erence o him as a god;1 hey say ha hrough him hey ha e been se ree rom yrannous mas ers, rom unending error and daily and nigh ly ear. Wha error? Wha ear? Where is he crone so silly as o be a raid o he bugbears o which you gen lemen would, i is ob ious, ha e been a raid, i you had no s udied na ural philosophy?2 "The lo y Acherunsian emples o Orcus,3 wan haun s o dea h, regions clouded o er wi h darkness." Should no a philosopher blush o boas o no being a raid o such hings and o ha ing disco ered heir alsi y? And rom his we can realize he na ural in elligence o hose olk who would, wi hou ins ruc ion, ha e belie ed hem rue. n n
 n n
 
 Yes, bu i is a no able achie emen o ha e learn ha , when once he hour o dea h had come, hey would wholly perish! And gran ed ha i be so—I am no con es ing i —wha ground is here in his or joy or boas ing? And ye no reason really sugges s i sel o my mind why he belie o Py hagoras and Pla o4 should no be rue. For hough Pla o produced no reasoned proo —no e he ribu e I pay he man—he would crush me by he mere weigh o his au hori y: he has, on he con rary, produced such a number o proo s ha i seems he wished o con ince o hers, and beyond doub he seems o ha e con inced himsel . n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 Bu qui e a number o hinkers con end agains his belie and by a sor o capi al sen ence punish souls wi h dea h, and ye hey ha e no reason or hinking he immor ali y o souls incredible excep ha hey are unable o unders and or grasp he concep ion o he na ure o soul wi hou body. As i indeed hey unders ood i s na ure, i s shape, i s size, i s posi ion whils ac ually in he body. Bu supposing or he momen ha all ha is now concealed were discernible in he li ing man, would i seem likely ha he soul could come wi hin he scope o ision, or ra her be o such ine subs ance as o escape he eye? n n
 n n
 
 Le he hinkers who say hey canno unders and soul wi hou body re lec upon hese considera ions, and hey will see how ar hey unders and soul while i is ac ually in he body. For my par , when I s udy he na ure o he soul, he concep ion o i in he body, as i were in a home ha is no i s own, presen s i sel as one much more di icul , much more doub ul han he concep ion o he na ure o he soul when i has qui ed he body and come in o he ree hea en, as i were o i s home. For unless we are unable o realize he na ure o wha we ha e ne er seen, beyond doub we can orm a concep ion o God Himsel and he di ine soul se ree rom he body. I is rue ha Dicaearchus and Aris oxenus1 said ha he soul had no exis ence a all because o he di icul y o unders anding wha he soul was or wha i s na ure was. n n
 n n
 
 I is a poin o he u mos impor ance o realize ha he soul sees by means o he soul alone, and surely his is he meaning o Apollo's maxim ad ising ha each one should know himsel . For I do no suppose he meaning o he
 n
 maxim is ha we should know our limbs, our heigh or shape; our sel es are no bodies, and in speaking as I do o you, I am no speaking o your body. When hen Apollo says, "Know hysel ,"1 he says, "Know hy soul." For he body is as i were a essel or a sor o shel er or he soul: e ery ac o your soul is an ac o yours. Unless hen i had been godlike o know he soul, his maxim, which marks a soul o superior pene ra ion,2 would no ha e been a ribu ed o he god. n n
 Bu i he soul i sel pro e o be wi hou knowledge o he na ure o soul, ell me, pray, will i no ha e knowledge e en o i s exis ence? or e en o i s mo emen ? n n

 On he o her hand a beginning has no bir h, or all hings ha e origin in a beginning, bu he beginning i sel can be born rom no hing else, or he hing ha should be bego en rom any hing else would no be a beginning.

Since i is clear, hen, ha ha which is sel -mo ing is e ernal, who is here o say ha his proper y has no been bes owed on souls? For e ery hing which is se in mo ion by impulse rom he ou side is soulless; wha on he o her hand has soul is s irred by mo emen rom wi hin and i s own. For his is he peculiar essence and charac er o he soul which, i i is ou o all hings he one which is sel -mo ing, has assuredly no been born and is e ernal." n n
 n n
 
 
 All he lower order o philosophers— or such a i le seems appropria e o hose who disagree wi h Pla o and Socra es and heir school—may i hey please lay heir heads oge her, and no only will hey ne er unra el any problem so nea ly, bu hey will no e en apprecia e he accuracy o he conclusion. The soul hen is conscious ha i is in mo ion, and when so conscious i is a he same ime conscious o his, ha i is sel -mo ed by i s own power and no an ou side power, and ha i canno e er be abandoned by i sel ; and his is proo o e erni y—unless you ha e any hing o ad ance. n n
 
 A. n n I ha e ound i easy o le no argumen o he con rary so much as en er my head; I here ore suppor he iew you ha e gi en. n n
 n n
 
 
 M. n n Again! Can you hink, pray, hose iews o less impor ance which pronounce ha here are di ine elemen s in human souls? Could I discern how such elemen s could come in o being I
 n
 should also see how hey came o an end. For i seems o me ha I can ell rom wha he blood, bile, phlegm, bones, sinews, eins,1 in ac all he ramework o he limbs and he whole body ha e been compounded and how hey were ashioned: as or he soul i sel , i i had no charac eris ic excep ha hrough i we ha e li e, I should hink ha he li e o men was suppor ed by na ural process much as he li e o a ine or a ree is, or such hings we say ha e li e. Also, i man's soul had no charac eris ic excep ha o seeking ou or a oiding hings, ha also i would share wi h he beas s. n n
 n n
 
 In he irs place, soul has memory, a memory oo wi hou limi o hings wi hou number; and his Pla o wishes o make he recollec ion2 o a pre ious li e. For in he book en i led Meno Socra es asks a li le lad cer ain geome rical ques ions abou he measuremen o he square. To hese ques ions he boy makes answer as a boy would, ye he ques ions are so easy3 ha by gi ing his answers s ep by s ep he ge s o he same conclusion as he would i he had learn geome ry: his Socra es regards as proo ha learning is no hing bu recollec ing. This subjec he de elops oo wi h much grea er care in he con ersa ion which he held on he ery day he depar ed his li e; or he here eaches ha anyone, hough o all appearance o ally ignoran , shows in answer o skil ul ques ioning ha he is no a he ime learning a lesson bu aking knowledge o hings a resh by remembrance; indeed in no o her way was i possible or us o possess rom
 n
 childhood such a number o impor an ideas, inna e and as i were impressed1 on our souls and called ἔννοιαι,2 unless he soul, be ore i had en ered he body, had been ac i e in acquiring knowledge. n n
 n n
 
 And since here is no rue exis ence in any sensible objec , as Pla o e erywhere argues— or he hinks ha no hing ha has a beginning and an ending exis s, and only ha exis s which is always cons an o i s na ure; his he calls ἰδέα and we "idea"— he soul in he prison-house o he body could no ha e apprehended ideas; i brough he knowledge wi h i : consequen ly our eeling o wonder a he ex en o our knowledge is remo ed. Ye he soul, when suddenly shi ed in o such an unaccus omed and disordered dwelling-place, does no clearly see ideas, bu when i has composed and reco ered i sel i apprehends hem by remembrance. Thus, according o Pla o, learning is no hing bu recollec ing.3 n n
 n n
 
 Bu or my par I wonder a memory in a s ill grea er degree.4 For wha is i ha enables us o remember, or wha charac er has i , or wha is i s origin? I am no inquiring in o he powers o memory which, i is said, Simonides possessed, or
 n
 Theodec es, or he powers o Cineas, whom Pyrrhus sen as ambassador o he Sena e, or he powers in recen days o Charmadas, or o Scepsius Me rodorus, who was la ely ali e, or he powers o our own Hor ensius.1 I am speaking o he a erage memory o man, and chie ly o hose who are engaged in some higher branch o s udy and ar , whose men al capaci y i is hard o es ima e, so much do hey remember. n n
 n n
 
 
 Wha hen is he objec o wha I am saying? I hink i mus be clear by now wha he power so displayed is and whence i comes. Cer ainly i is no a quali y o hear or blood or brain or a oms. Whe her i is o brea h or ire I know no , and I am no ashamed, as hose o hers were, o admi ing my ignorance where I am ignoran : his I do say, i I could make any o her asser ions on a subjec o such di icul y, I should be ready o swear ha , whe her soul is brea h or ire, i is di ine. For consider, I pray, can you really hink ha i is rom ear h, where our a mosphere is so wa ery and oggy, ha he prodigious power o memory has origina ed or been ormed? I you do no see he righ answer o he ques ion, ye you see he problem i in ol es: i you do no see e en ha much, ye surely you see i s impor ance. n n
 n n
 
 Wha hen? Do we hink ha here is in he soul a sor o roominess in o which he hings we remember can be poured as i in o a kind o essel? Tha would be ridiculous; wha can we unders and as he bo om or shape o such a soul, or wha room a all can i ha e ha is adequa e?2 Or do we hink ha like wax he soul has marks impressed upon i and ha memory consis s o he races o hings regis ered
 n
 in he mind? Wha can be he races o words, o ac ual objec s, wha ur her could be he enormous space adequa e o he represen a ion o such a mass o ma erial? Again, wha , I ask, is he power which in es iga es hidden secre s, which is known as disco ery and con ri ance? Do you hink i was ormed ou o his ear hy, mor al and perishable subs ance? n n
 n n
 
 Or was he man so ormed who irs assigned a name o e ery hing, an achie emen which Py hagoras hough one o supreme wisdom; or he man who irs uni ed he sca ered human uni s in o a body and summoned hem o he ellowship o social li e; or he man who by a ew wri en charac ers de ined he meaning o he endless arie y, as i seemed, o he sounds o he oice; or he man who marked down he pa hs o he wandering s ars, heir passings in ron o one ano her, heir s oppings?1 All hese were grea men; earlier s ill he men who disco ered he rui s o he ear h, raimen , dwellings, an ordered way o li e, pro ec ion agains wild crea ures—men under whose ci ilizing and re ining guidance we ha e gradually passed on rom he indispensable handicra s o he iner ar s. For hrough hem our ears ha e gained keen deligh rom he disco ery o he due combina ions o musical sounds o di erse quali y, and we ha e looked up a he s ars, bo h hose ha are ixed in cer ain spo s and hose ha by name are wandering,2 hough no really so, and he who has seen heir re olu ions and all heir mo emen s has augh ha his soul resembles His whose word had ashioned hem in he hea ens. n n
 n n
 n
 
 For when Archimedes as ened on a globe1 he mo emen s o moon, sun and i e wandering s ars, he, jus like Pla o's God who buil he world in he Timaeus,2 made one re olu ion o he sphere con rol se eral mo emen s u erly unlike in slowness and speed. Now i in his world o ours phenomena canno ake place wi hou he ac o God, nei her could Archimedes ha e reproduced he same mo emen s upon a globe wi hou di ine genius. n n
 n n
 
 
 To my mind e en be er known and more amous ields o labour do no seem remo ed rom di ine in luence, or su er me o hink ha he poe pours ou his solemn, swelling s rain wi hou some hea enly inspira ion, or ha eloquence lows in a copious s ream o echoing words and rui ul hough s wi hou some higher in luence: as o philosophy, he mo her o all ar s, wha else is i excep , as Pla o held, he gi ,3 or, as I hold, he disco ery o he gods? I ins ruc ed us irs in he worship o gods, hen in he jus ice o mankind a large which is roo ed in he social union o he race o men, and nex augh us he lessons o emperance and grea ness o soul, and hus dispersed he darkness rom he eyes as i were o he mind, so ha we saw all hings abo e, below, hings irs and las and in be ween. n n
 n n
 
 A power able o bring abou such a number o impor an resul s is o my mind wholly di ine. For wha is he memory o ac s and words? Wha ur her is disco ery?4 Assuredly no hing can be
 n
 comprehended e en in God o grea er alue han his. I do no hink he gods deligh in ambrosia or nec ar or Hebe illing he cups, and I do no lis en o Homer who says ha Ganymede was carried o by he gods or his beau y o ser e as cup-bearer o Jupi er: here was no jus reason why such cruel wrong should be in lic ed on Laomedon.1 Homer imagined hese hings and a ribu ed human eelings o he gods: I had ra her he had a ribu ed di ine eelings o us. Bu wha do we unders and by di ine a ribu es? Ac i i y, wisdom, disco ery, memory. There ore he soul is, as I say, di ine, as Euripides dares o say, God:2 and in ac , i God is ei her air or ire, so also is he soul o man; or jus as he hea enly na ure is ree rom ear h and mois ure, so he human soul is wi hou race o ei her elemen .

Objec s percei ed by he senses are always changing and hardly e er he same. The soul is akin o he in isible and unchanging: he body o he isible and changing. The body drags he soul in o he region o he isible and changing, and he soul wanders and is con used.

 The enor o his hough and he argumen s he used were ha here are wo pa hs, a wo old course or souls on depar ure rom he body: or hose, he said, who had pollu ed hemsel es wi h he sins ha men commi , and deli ered hemsel es o er wholly o heir lus s, and under heir blinding in luence had ei her de iled hemsel es by pri a e sins and iniqui ies or had by public ou rages been guil y o o ences ha could no be a oned, had be ore hem a road apar , remo e rom he company o he gods; hey, on he o her hand, who had kep hemsel es pure and chas e, who had su ered leas con ac wi h he body and always separa ed hemsel es rom i and in he bodies o men had ollowed he li e o he gods, had an easy way o re urn be ore hem o hose rom whom hey had se ou . n n
 n n
 
 And so he rela es ha jus as he swans—who ha e been consecra ed o Apollo, no undesignedly, bu because rom
 n
 Apollo hey seem o ha e he gi o prophecy, and hus ha e a ore as e o he blessing dea h brings—die wi h a song o rap ure,1 so mus all good and learned men do likewise. n n
 n n
 
 And in ac no one could en er ain a doub o his, unless in hinking a en i ely abou he soul we su er he same experience as o en comes rom gazing in en ly a he se ing sun, ha is o losing en irely he sense o sigh ; in he same way he mind's ision, in gazing upon i sel some imes waxes dim, and or ha reason we relax he s eadiness o con empla ion. And so doub ing, wa ching, wa ering, earing many an ad erse chance, our argumen is dri en as i on a ski in a boundless sea.2 This, howe er, is ancien his ory and Greek his ory oo: bu Ca o3 depar ed rom li e wi h a eeling o joy in ha ing ound a reason or dea h; or he God who is mas er wi hin us orbids our depar ure wi hou permission; when, howe er, God Himsel has gi en a alid reason as He did in he pas o Socra es, and in our day o Ca o, and o en o many o hers, hen o a sure y your rue wise man will joy ully pass or hwi h rom he darkness here in o he ligh beyond. All he same he will no break he bonds o his prison-house— he laws orbid i —bu as i in obedience o a magis ra e or some law ul au hori y, he will pass ou a he summons and release o God.4 For he whole li e o he philosopher, as he same wise man says, is a prepara ion or dea h.5 n n
 n n

 For wha else do we do when we seques er he soul rom pleasure, or ha means rom he body; rom pri a e proper y, he handmaid and ser an o he body; rom public in eres s; rom any kind o business: wha , I say, do we hen do excep summon he soul o i s own presence, orce i o companionship wi h i sel and wi hdraw i comple ely rom he body? Bu is se erance o he soul rom he body any hing else han learning how o die? Le us, here ore, belie e me, make his prepara ion and dissocia ion o oursel es rom our bodies, ha is, le us habi ua e oursel es o die. This will, bo h or he ime o our sojourn on ear h, resemble hea enly li e, and when we shall be released rom our chains here, he progress o our soul will be less re arded. For hey who ha e always been caugh in he shackles o he body, e en when hey are se ree, ad ance more slowly, like men who ha e been many years bound wi h chains. And when we ha e come yonder, hen and no be ore shall we li e; or his li e is indeed dea h, and I could sorrow o er i i so I would. n n

For he holds wha nobody denies, ha wha e er has been born perishes; bu he asser s ha souls are born, as is shown by he resemblance o children o heir paren s, which is mani es in disposi ions and no only in bodily ea ures. He alleges nex as his second proo ha here is no hing sensible o pain wi hou being also suscep ible o sickness; all, howe er, ha is subjec o disease, will also perish; now souls are sensible o pain, here ore hey also perish. n n
 n n
 
 
 These argumen s can be re u ed. For hey show his ignorance o he ac ha , when a s a emen is made abou he e erni y o souls, i is made abou he mind which is always ree rom disorderly impulse, and no abou hose par s o us which are subjec o he a acks o dis ress, anger and lus , and hese Pla o, agains whom his argumen s are direc ed, regards as remo e and isola ed rom he mind.3 Then as o resemblance, his is n n

 ...more ob ious in animals whose souls ha e no race o reason; besides in man resemblance is ound more in he con orma ion o he body, and i makes a grea di erence wha sor o body i is in which souls are ac ually placed; or here are many condi ions o he body ending o sharpen he mind and many o deaden i . Indeed Aris o le says ha men o alen are a rabilious and so makes me less dis ressed a being ra her slow-wi ed.1 He gi es a long lis o ins ances and, as i he poin were se led, adds a reason or he phenomenon.

 I pass o er cases where here are no ea ures o resemblance. I could ha e wished ha Panae ius could ha e been here—he li ed in in imacy wi h A ricanus—: I should ha e asked him which member o he amily A ricanus' grea -nephew2 had resembled, who was he image o his a her in ace, bu in manner o li e resembled all debauchees, wi h his dis inc ion, ha he was easily he mos degraded; I should ha e asked oo whom he grandson o P.

Bu wha are we abou ? ha e we orgo en ha a presen he subjec o considera ion, a er we had spoken su icien ly abou e erni y, was ha no e en i souls perished was here any e il in dea h?3 n n

 M. n n I see ha you ha e lo y aims and ha you wish o be a pilgrim hea enward. I hope ha his will be our lo . Bu suppose, as hese hinkers hold, ha souls do no sur i e a er dea h: I see ha in ha case we are depri ed o he hope o a happier li e. Bu wha e il does such a iew imply? For suppose ha he soul perishes like he body: is here hen any de ini e sense o pain or sensa ion a all in he body a er dea h? There is no one who says so, hough Epicurus accuses Democri us o his, bu he ollowers o Democri us deny i . And so here is no sensa ion in he soul ei her, or he soul is nowhere. Where, hen, is he e il, since here is no hird hing? Is i because he ac ual depar ure o soul rom body does no ake place wi hou sense o pain? Though I should belie e his o be so, how pe y a ma er i is! Bu I hink i alse, and he ac is ha o en he depar ure akes place wi hou sensa ion, some imes e en wi h a eeling o pleasure; and he whole hing is ri ial, wha e er he ru h, or depar ure akes place in a momen o ime. n n

I could do so wi h ru h and jus ice. Bu wha need is here, when my objec is o a oid he hough ha we shall be wre ched a er dea h, o rendering li e s ill more wre ched by lamen a ion? We ha e done his in he book in which we did our u mos o console oursel es.1 Dea h hen wi hdraws us rom e il, no

 There is an epigram o Callimachus2 upon Cleombro us o Ambracia who, he says, wi hou ha ing me wi h any mis or une, lung himsel rom he ci y wall in o he sea a er reading Pla o's book. Now in he book o Hegesias whom I ha e men ioned, Ἀποκαρτερῶν,3 here appears a man who was passing away rom li e by s ar a ion and is called back by his riends, and in answer o heir remons rances, de ails he discom or s o human li e. I could do he same, bu I should no go so ar as he does in hinking i no ad an age a all or anyone o li e. O her cases I wa e aside: is i an ad an age s ill o me?

 And re ed ceilings richly car ed, n n would he ha e depar ed rom good or rom e il? A ha da e assuredly he would ha e seemed o depar rom good. Cer ainly i would ha e been a be er a e, and s rains so melancholy would no ha e been sung: 
 
 By he lames I saw all hings de oured, n n

 Jo e's al ar by bloodshed pollu ed. n n As i in such a scene o iolence any hing be er could ha e happened or him in ha hour! Bu i he had died pre iously he would ha e wholly escaped so sad an ending: bu by dying a he momen he did he escaped he sense o he e ils abou him. n n

Had his li e come o an end hen, would he ha e le a scene o good or a scene o e il? Cer ainly he would ha e escaped wre chedness. He would no ha e gone o war wi h his a her-in-law,2 he would no ha e aken up arms when unprepared, he would no ha e le home, he would no ha e led rom I aly, he would no ha e los his army and allen unpro ec ed in o he hands o armed sla es; his poor

Bu le us go so ar as o make he admission ha mankind are depri ed o blessings by dea h: mus we here ore also gran ha he dead eel he need o he com or s o li e, and ha his is a condi ion o wre chedness?2 Assuredly ha is wha hey mus say. Is i possible or he man who does no exis o " eel he need o " any hing? The mere erm " eeling he need o " has a melancholy sound, because he meaning ha underlies i is, he had, he has no ; he misses, looks or, wan s. These, I hink, are he discom or s o one who " eels he need o "; he " eels he need o " eyes, blindness is ha e ul; o children, barrenness is ha e ul. This holds good among he li ing, bu as regards he dead, no one " eels he need," I do no say o he com or s o li e, bu e en o li e i sel . I say his o he dead who do no exis ; bu do we who exis " eel he need" in his sense o horns or ea hers? Can anyone make such a s a emen ? Undoub edly none. Why so? Because, as you are wi hou ha or which you are sui ed nei her by acquired skill nor by na ure, you canno " eel he need o " i , e en i you should be conscious ha you do no possess i . n n

 This argumen mus be repea edly insis ed upon when we ha e irmly es ablished he poin , abou which, i souls are mor al, we can ha e no doub , namely ha des ruc ion in dea h is so comple e ha no e en he ain es es ige o sensa ion is le behind: when ha , hen, is properly se led or once and all, we mus horoughly si , so as o be sure o i , he meaning o " eeling he need o ," ha here may be no possibili y o mis ake in using he phrase. This hen is he meaning o " eeling he n need o ,"1 o be in wan o any hing you wish o possess; or here is a no ion o wish in " eeling he need o ,"—excep when he word carere is used in ano her sense, as or ins ance o a e er, meaning " o be wi hou e er." For i is using he word in qui e a di eren sense o use i where one has no go some hing and is conscious o no ha ing i , e en i one can readily pu up wi h being wi hou i . To " eel he need o " is no used in connec ion wi h e il; or hen e il would no be a hing o grie e abou : he expression " o eel he need o " a good is used, and ha amoun s o an e il. Bu no e en a li ing man " eels he need o " a good, i he does no wan i . In he case o a li ing man i is, howe er, in elligible o say ha you " eel he need o " a hrone— ha , howe er, canno be said qui e accura ely in your case, hough i could ha e been in he case o Tarquin a er he had been de hroned2—: 
 
 n
 s ill in he case o a dead man i is no e en in elligible, or " o eel he need o " is appropria e o a sen ien being, and in a dead man here is no sensa ion in a dead man here ore here is no possibili y ei her o " eeling he need o ." n n

I dea h indeed had been heir ear, L. Bru us would no ha e allen in ba le, pre en ing he re urn o he yran 1 whom he had himsel dri en ou ; he elder Decius in despera e con lic wi h he La ins, his son in con lic wi h he E ruscans, his grandson igh ing Pyrrhus2 would no ha e lung hemsel es upon he weapons o he enemy; Spain would no ha e seen he Scipios3 alling or heir coun ry in he sel same war; Cannae4 would no ha e seen he all o Paullus and Geminus, Venusia o Marcellus,5 Li ana o Albinus6 and Lucania o Gracchus.7 Can any one o hese a he presen day be wre ched? No e en on he day hey ell, a er heir las brea h, or no one can be wre ched when sensa ion has en irely gone. n n

 Bu , i may be objec ed, he mere absence o sensa ion is ha e ul.

I i is na ure's law ha , as our bir h brings he beginning o all hings, so dea h brings us he end o all: hen, as we brough no hing in o he world a bir h, so we ake no hing ou o he world a dea h. Wha e il can here be in his, seeing ha

 Those who minimize i are or making i closely resemble sleep:2 jus as i anyone would wish o li e or nine y years on condi ion o sleeping he remainder a er he had comple ed six y.

You do no hink hen ha he is anxious o er he worries3 o he moon, by whom i is hough he was lulled o sleep, ha she migh kiss him in his slumber. Nay, why should he be anxious who has no so much as he power o sensa ion? You ha e sleep, dea h's coun er ei , and his you daily pu on like a garmen , and you doub he ac o here being no sensa ion in dea h, hough you see ha in i s coun er ei here is no sensa ion. n n

 Le such ollies hen as hinking ha i is wre ched o die be ore our ime be pushed aside as old wi es' ables, which hey pre y nearly are. Wha " ime," pray? Na ure's? Why, she i is who has gran ed he use o li e like a loan, wi hou ixing any day or repaymen . Wha is here hen or you o complain o , i she calls i in when she will? Those were he erms on which you had accep ed he loan. The same grumblers hink ha i a small child dies, he loss mus be borne calmly; i an in an in he cradle, here mus no e en be a lamen . And ye in his la er case na ure has called in her gi wi h grea er cruel y. "The in an had no ye as ed he swee ness o

 On he o her hand, he lo o hose who die a he close o heir prime is applauded. Why should i be? I imagine o no men could a longer li e, i i were gran ed hem, pro e more agreeable. For here is, assuredly, no hing dearer o a man han wisdom, and hough age akes away all else, i undoub edly brings us ha . Wha li e ime in ac is long, or wha is here long a all or a human being?

 Now he children, now he young men, ollowing closely in he race, n n

By he ri er Hypanis, which lows in o he Pon us rom a par o Europe, Aris o le says ha a kind o small animal is born, which li es or a single day.

 Le us hen despise all ollies—wha milder

 Bu i our minds are kep in he suspense and or ure and anguish o expec a ion and longing, ye immor al gods! how deligh ul should he journey pro e which a i s close lea es us no ur her care, no anxie y or he u ure! How charmed I am wi h Theramenes! How lo y a spiri is his! For hough we shed ears as we read, ne er heless a no able man dies a dea h ha is no pi iable: he was lung in o prison by order o he hir y yran s, and when he had swallowed he poison like a hirs y man he ossed he remainder ou o he cup2 o make a splash, and wi h a laugh a he sound i made, “I drink," said he, " o he heal h o he air Cri ias," he man who had rea ed him abominably; I may explain ha a heir banque s he Greeks make a prac ice o naming he gues o whom hey are going o pass he cup. This noble spiri jes ed wi h his las brea h, hough he already had wi hin him he dea h his i als had absorbed, and in reali y he prophesied or he man he had oas ed in he poison he dea h which shor ly o er ook him.3 n n
 n n
 
 Who would applaud his calmness o a grea spiri in he
 n
 hour o dea h, did he judge dea h o be an e il? Theramenes passed o he same prison and he same bowl as Socra es a ew years la er, condemned by a sen ence o judges as criminal as ha o he yran s on Theramenes. Wha hen is he speech which Pla o represen s Socra es as ha ing gi en be ore his judges when he dea h sen ence had been pronounced?1 n n
 
 "I en er ain, gen lemen o he jury, high hopes," said he, " ha i is or my good ha I am sen o dea h; or here mus ollow one o wo consequences, ei her ha dea h akes away all sensa ion al oge her, or ha by dea h a passage is secured rom hese regions o ano her place. Accordingly, i sensa ion is obli era ed and dea h resembles he sleep which some imes brings he calmes res , un roubled e en by he appearances o dreams, good gods, wha gain i is o die! or how many days can be ound pre erable o such a nigh , and i he coming endless succession o ensuing ime resembles his sleep, who can be happier han I? n n

 Bu i here is ru h in he ale ha dea h is a passage o hose shores which are inhabi ed by he depar ed dead, ha is surely happier s ill. To hink ha , when hou has escaped rom hose who wish o be reckoned judges, hou ar coming o hose who can really be called judges, Minos, Rhadaman hus, Aeacus and Trip olemus,2 and mee es he men who ha e li ed righ eous and ai h ul li es: does his seem o you an ordinary pilgrimage? Wha alue, pray, do you se upon he pri ilege o ac ually con ersing wi h Orpheus, Musaeus, Homer and Hesiod? For my par I could eel in my hear he wish o die many imes, ha I migh ha e he pri ilege o inding wha

Do no you ei her, he judges who ha e o ed or my acqui al, ha e ear o dea h. n n

 For no e il can be all any good man ei her in li e or in dea h, nor will his roubles e er be disregarded by he immor al gods, nor has my own lo come by acciden . In ru h I ha e no ground or anger wi h my accusers or hose who ha e condemned me, excep ha hey ha e belie ed ha hey are doing me an injury."

 could be proud! So much so, ha o my hinking a
 man o such high spiri was undeser edly condemned. n n

 Such examples our S a e has produced in coun less

 "Die, Diagoras, or you are no des ined o ascend

In Ennius' ragedy o ha name: or Neop olemus c . I. § 85.



says ha he mus play he philosopher, bu only a li le way, or o doing so en irely he did no appro e:2

In Pla o's Gorgias, 484 C, Callicles says, φιλοσοφία γάρ τοι ἐστι χαρίεν, ἄν τις αὐτοῦ μετρίως ἅψηται ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ· ἐὰν δὲ περαιτέρω τοῦ δέοντος ἐνδιατρίψῃ, διαφθορὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων. C . also Taci us, Agric. IV, where he says ha Agricola prima in ju en a s udium philosophiae acrius, ul ra quam concessum Romano ac sena ori, hausisse, ni pruden ia ma ris incensum ac lagran em animum coercuisse .



I on he o her hand, Bru us, hink ha or my par I “mus ” play he philosopher; or wha can I busy mysel wi h be er, abo e all a a ime when I ha e no hing o busy mysel wi h? Bu no “a li le way” as Neop olemus said, or i is di icul o ha e a li le knowledge in philosophy wi hou ha ing ei her a grea deal or all ha here is: or nei her can a li le be selec ed excep rom much nor, when a man has learn a li le, will he no also go on wi h he same eagerness o mas er wha remains. n n
 n n
 
 All he same in a busy li e and he li e o a soldier, as Neop olemus hen was, only a li le is o en o grea bene i and bears rui —i no he hea y crop which can be ga hered rom he whole ield o philosophy, ye rui ha can a imes ree us in a measure rom lus or dis ress or ear; as or ins ance he discussion I la ely held a my house a Tusculum seemed o resul in a noble scorn o dea h, and his is o no sligh alue in se ing he soul ree rom ear, n n
 n n
 n
 
 or he man who is a raid o he ine i able can by no manner o means li e wi h a soul a peace; bu he man who is wi hou ear o dea h, no simply because i is una oidable bu also because i has no errors or him, has secured a aluable aid owards rendering li e happy. n n
 n n
 
 And ye I am well assured ha many will argue eagerly agains my iew, bu his i was by no means in my power o a oid excep by wri ing no hing a all. For as regards he speeches in which i was my aim o win he appro al o he mul i ude ( or ora ory is a popular ar and eloquence wins he appro al o he hearers1

Cicero says ha he speeches he deli ered in ormer days were cri icised by would-be A icis s or being urgid, bu hey were popular. Wha is o happen o him in his new en ure, when he can no longer coun on popular suppor ?


, n n
 n n
 
 For philosophy is con en wi h ew judges, and o se purpose on her side a oids he mul i ude and is in her urn an objec o suspicion and dislike o hem, wi h he resul ha i anyone should be disposed o n
 re ile all philosophy he could coun on popular suppor , or i he should ry o a ack he school o which we are in he main adheren s, he would ha e power ul assis ance rom he o her schools o philosophy. n n
 
 II. In he Hor ensius, howe er, we ha e replied o he re ilers o philosophy as a whole, whils in he our books o he Academics we ha e se ou , as we hink wi h su icien precision, all ha could be urged on behal o he Academy: all he same we are so ar rom depreca ing cri icism ha we should e en welcome i hear ily, or e en in i s bes days Greek philosophy would ne er ha e been held in such high honour, i he ri alries and disagreemen s o i s chie exponen s had no main ained i s ac i i y. n n
 n n
 
 
 For his reason I encourage all, who ha e he capaci y, o wres rom he now ailing grasp o Greece he renown won rom his ield o s udy and rans er i o his ci y, jus as our ances ors by heir inde a igable zeal rans erred here all he o her really desirable a enues o renown.

 Bu once hese s udies are rans erred o oursel es, we shall ha e no need e en o Greek libraries, in which here is an endless number o books due o he crowd o wri ers; or he same hings are said by many since he day hey crammed he world wi h books and hings will be he same here oo i a larger s ream o wri ers se s oward hese s udies. Bu le us, i we can, s imula e hose who, possessing a liberal educa ion and he power o arguing wi h precision, can deal orderly and me hodically wi h philosophical ques ions. n n

Wha ollowers o his school say and wha hey hink is no unknown o anyone o e en modera e learning. Inasmuch here ore as by heir own showing hey do no rouble how hey express hemsel es, I do no see why hey should be read excep in he circle o hose who hold he same iews and read heir books o one ano her. n n
 n n
 
 For e eryone, e en hose who do no accep heir eaching or are no en husias ic disciples, reads Pla o and he res o he Socra ic school and a er hem heir ollowers, whils scarcely anyone beyond heir own adheren s akes up he works o Epicurus and Me rodorus;2

Me rodorus was a pupil o Epicurus and called by Cicero in De Finibus "paene al er Epicurus." He is no he same as he Scepsius Me rodorus o I. § 59.



similarly hese La in wri ers are only read by hose who appro e heir ene s. n n
 n n
 n
 
 Our opinion on he o her hand is ha e ery hing commi ed o wri ing should appro e i sel o he as e o all educa ed readers, and i we oursel es are unable qui e o succeed in his, we do no or ha reason hink we should aba e our e or s o do so. n n
 n n
 
 Accordingly hese considera ions always led me o pre er he rule o he Peripa e ics and he Academy o discussing bo h sides o e ery ques ion, no only or he reason ha in no o her way did I hink i possible or he probable ru h o be disco ered in each par icular problem, bu also because I ound i ga e he bes prac ice in ora ory. Aris o le irs employed his me hod and la er hose who ollowed him. Philo,1

howe er, as we remember, or we o en heard him lec ure, made a prac ice o eaching he rules o he rhe oricians a one ime, and hose o he philosophers a ano her. I was induced by our riends o ollow his prac ice, and in my house a Tusculum I hus employed he ime a our disposal. Accordingly, a er spending he morning in rhe orical exercises, we wen in he a ernoon, as on he day be ore, down o he Academy,2

Cicero had wo gymnasia a his Tusculan illa, an upper one called Lyceum and a lower one called Academia. Caesar's day on his isi o Cicero, described in Ad A . XIII. 52, was: business ill midday, hen a walk on he shore (bu exercise migh be aken in he illa), hen he ba h, hen dinner abou hal -pas one, and a er ha con ersa ion.



and here a discussion ook place which I do no presen in narra i e orm, bu as nearly as I can in he exac words o our ac ual discussion. n n
 n n
 
 IV. As hen we walked abou he gymnasium our deba e was s ar ed, origina ing in a beginning o pre y much he ollowing charac er. A. I is impossible or me o express he deligh or ra her he eeling o com or I deri ed rom yes erday's discussion, or hough I am no aware o ha ing e er been o er-anxious o li e, ne er heless a shadow o ear and pain occasionally crossed my mind a he hough ha one day here would be an end o his ligh o day and a loss o all he com or s o li e. n n
 n n

 From his kind o dis ress, belie e me, I ha e been relie ed so comple ely ha I hink ha no hing should be less a source o anxie y. n n

 M. There is no hing as onishing in ha , or i shows he e ec o philosophy: i is a physician o souls, akes away he load o emp y roubles, se s us ree rom desires and banishes ears. Bu i s in luence canno be he same or all i s e ec is grea when i has secured a hold upon a charac er sui ed o i . For i is no only rue ha " or une helps he bra e," as he old pro erb says, bu philosophic hough does so in a ar higher degree, and by i s lessons s reng hens as i were he quali y o bra ery. Na ure clearly ga e you a your bir h a cer ain ele a ed and lo y spiri ha looks down on hings ear hly, and so a speech deli ered agains dea h readily ound a res ing place in a bra e soul. Bu can you hink ha hese same argumen s ha e real in luence, apar rom qui e a ew excep ions, wi h he ery men by whom hese argumen s were disco ered, reasoned ou and commi ed o wri ing? How ew philosophers are ound o be so cons i u ed and o ha e principles and a rule o li e so irmly se led as reason requires! how ew here are o hink ha he ene s o heir school are no a display o knowledge bu a law o li e! o con rol hemsel es o heir own will and obey heir own dogmas! n n
 n n
 
 Some o hem we may see guil y o such ri oli y and ani y ha i would ha e been ar be er or hem ne er o ha e been s uden s; o hers are greedy or money, some or ame, many are sla es o heir passions, wi h he resul ha here is a wonder ul disharmony be ween heir alk and heir li es;1

C . Ju enal, Sa . II. 3, who speaks o hypocri ical S oics, Qui Curios simulan e Bacchanalia i un .



and his o my way o hinking is he mos shame ul hing possible. For jus as a man who pro essed o be a grammarian and spoke like a barbarian, or a man who wished o be considered a musician and sang ou o une, would be all he more con emp ible or ailing in he ery par icular in which he claimed pro iciency, so a philosopher who ails in he conduc o his li e is he more con emp ible in ha his ailure is in he du y o which he se s up o be a eacher, and, whils pro essing an ar o li ing, is a aul in his li e. n n

 V. A. Is i no here ore o be eared, i wha you say is rue, ha you may be decking ou philosophy in borrowed plumes? For wha can be a s ronger proo ha she is o no assis ance han ha some inished philosophers li e disgrace ully? M. Tha is in ru h no proo a all: or jus as all ields ha are illed are no produc i e, and he ollowing lines o Accius are alse:
 Though in o poorer soil good seed be sown
 The crops are ine by heir own na ure grown,
 so all charac ers when cul i a ed do no bear rui . And, o keep o he same comparison, jus as a ield, howe er er ile, can produce no crop wi hou cul i a ion, so he soul can produce none wi hou eaching. So rue is i ha ei her is eeble wi hou he o her. Now he cul i a ion o he soul is philosophy: i pulls ou ices by he roo s and makes souls ready o recei e he seed, and commi s o hem and, so o speak, sows in hem wha , when ully grown, may bear he mos abundan rui . n n

 we see greedy o gain, no a ew o ame, many sla es o lus , so ha here is a s range con radic ion be ween heir public u erances and heir li e;1

C . Ju enal, Sa . II. 3, who speaks o hypocri ical S oics, Qui Curios simulan e Bacchanalia i un .



and his seems o me a black disgrace. For jus as i is i a eacher claiming o be a grammarian were guil y o solecisms, or one who should wish o be regarded as a musician were o sing ou o une; he disgrace would be enhanced by he ac o his ailure in he ery subjec o which he pro essed he knowledge ; similarly he philosopher who ails o obser e his rule o li e is he more deeply disgraced, because he s umbles in he du y o which he aims a being he eacher and ails in he conduc o li e hough pro essing o gi e he rule o li e. n n
 n n
 
 V. A. I i is as you say, ha e we no reason o ear ha you are ricking ou philosophy in borrowed plumes? Wha s ronger proo o i s uselessness can here be han o ind ins ances o comple ely rained philosophers who lead disgrace ul li es? M. Tha is really no proo , or no all cul i a ed ields are produc i e, and he dic um o Accius2

is alse:

 Though placed in poorer soil good seed can ye n n
 O i s own na ure bear a shining crop, n n
 
 and in he same way no all educa ed minds bear rui . Moreo er, o con inue he same comparison, jus as a ield, howe er good he ground, canno be produc i e wi hou cul i a ion, so he soul canno be produc i e wi hou eaching. So rue i is ha he one wi hou he o her is ine ec i e. Now he cul i a ion o he soul is philosophy; his pulls ou ices by he roo s and makes souls i or he recep ion o seed, and commi s o he soul and, as we may say, sows in i seed o a kind o bear he riches rui when ully grown. n n
 n n
 n
 
 Le us go on hen as we ha e begun; ell me i you will, wha subjec you wish o ha e discussed.
 A. I consider pain he grea es o all e ils. M. Grea er e en han disgrace? A. I do no en ure o go so ar as ha and I am ashamed o ha ing been dislodged so speedily rom my posi ion. M. You should ha e been s ill more ashamed had you clung o i . For wha is more unwor hy han or you o regard any hing as worse han disgrace, crime and baseness? And o escape hese, wha pain should be, I do no say rejec ed, bu should no ra her be olun arily in i ed, endured and welcomed? A. I am en irely o ha opinion. So hen, gran ed ha pain be no indeed he chie e il, an e il i assuredly is. M. Do you see how much o he dread o pain you ha e go rid o , hanks o my brie reminder? n n
 n n
 
 A. I see clearly, bu I wan uller explana ion. M. Well, I shall ry; bu i is a serious under aking and I shall need a soul ha does no quail a he prospec . A. Tha you can coun upon, or as I did yes erday so o-day I shall ollow he argumen whi hersoe er i leads me.
 VI. M. In he irs place hen I shall deal wi h he eebleness o many philosophers belonging o di eren schools o hough . Firs among hem bo h in in luence and da e is Aris ippus he Socra ic,1

Aris ippus, pupil o Socra es and ounder o he Cyrenaic school, o whom he pleasure o he momen was he highes good.



who had no hesi a ion in pronouncing pain o be he chie e il; nex Epicurus len himsel qui e obedien ly o he suppor o his backboneless, e emina e iew; a er him Hieronymus2

Hieronymus belonged o he Peripa e ic school and li ed abou 300 B.C.



o Rhodes said ha he highes good was o be ree o pain: so much e il he hough lay in pain. The res , wi h he excep ion o Zeno,


Aris o and Pyrrho, held pre y nearly he iew you s a ed jus now, namely ha pain was admi edly an e il bu ha here were o her worse e ils. n n
 n n
 n
 
 We see hen ha , hough na ural ins inc and a sense o na i e wor h a once re ol ed agains your saying ha pain is he highes e il, and orced you, when aced wi h disgrace, o abandon your opinion, ye philosophy, he eacher o li e, has main ained ha iew or all hese cen uries.1

Cicero has already excep ed Zeno, Aris o and Pyrrho, so ha he canno mean all philosophers here, bu only ha all along some philosophers held ha pain was he chie e il.



Wha du y, wha repu a ion, wha glory will be o such alue ha he man who has once con inced himsel ha pain is he highes e il will be willing o seek o secure hem a he cos o bodily pain? And ur her wha shame, wha degrada ion will a man no submi o in order o a oid pain, i he has once decided i o be he highes e il? Who moreo er will no eel wre ched, no merely a he momen ha he is o er aken by a acks o ex reme pain, i hey in ol e he highes e il, bu also when he is conscious ha here is he prospec o pain? And who is here beyond i s reach? The resul is ha absolu ely no one can be happy. n n
 n n
 
 Me rodorus2

C . § 8.



no doub hinks ha man comple ely happy who has a good cons i u ion and an assurance ha he will always enjoy i : bu who is here who can ha e such assurance?
 VII. As or Epicurus, howe er, he speaks in a way ha makes him seem o my mind o be pro oking laugh er. For in one passage he asser s ha i he wise man be burn , i he be or ured—you are wai ing perhaps or him o say, "he will submi , will endure, will no yield": high praise by Hercules and wor hy o he grea god Hercules whose name I in oked; bu his is no enough or Epicurus, ha hard s ern spiri ; i he wise man inds himsel inside Phalaris' bull,1

Phalaris was a Sicilian yran o he six h cen ury B. C. who burn his ic ims in a brazen bull. Wha Epicurus said was ha he wise man was happy e en on he rack, κἂν στρεβλωθῇ.



he will say: "How swee ; how indi eren I am o his!" n n
 n n
 n
 
 Ac ually swee ? Or is "no bi er" a bi inadequa e? And ye hose ery philosophers2

The S oics.



who deny ha pain is an e il do no generally go so ar as o say ha i is swee o be or ured; hey say ha i is unpleasing, di icul , ha e ul, con rary o na ure, and ye ha i is no an e il: Epicurus, who says ha pain is he only e il and he wors o all e ils, hinks ha he wise man will pronounce i swee . n n
 n n
 
 For my par I do no require you o describe pain in he same words as Epicurus, ha de o ee, as you know, o pleasure. Le him, i he likes, say he same inside he bull o Phalaris as he would ha e said, had he been in his own bed: I do no a ribu e o wisdom such wonder ul power agains pain. I is enough or du y i he wise man is bra e in endurance; I do no require him o rejoice; or pain is a melancholy condi ion beyond doub , unpleasing, dis as e ul, repugnan o na ure, di icul o submi o and bear. n n
 n n
 
 Look a Philoc e es whose moans we mus pardon, or he had seen he migh y Hercules on Oe a shrieking aloud in he ex remi y o his pains.3

Philoc e es, son o Poeas, alone consen ed o ligh he uneral pyre or Hercules, and recei ed his bow and arrows as a reward. In he Trojan expedi ion Philoc e es was wounded in he oo by one o Hercules' poisoned arrows. His ou cries orced he Greeks o lea e him on he island o Lemnos.

 No com or , here ore, did he arrows he had recei ed rom Hercules gi e his hero when

From ipers' bi e he eins o all his lesh, n n
Tain ed wi h enom, cruel or ures s ir. n n
And hus he cries ou in he longing or aid and desire o dea h: n n

Ah! who o he sal sea-wa es can consign n n
Me rom he summi o he cli on high? n n
Now, now pierces he pain and he killing n n
Migh o he wound and he ulcer's ire.1 n n
 

These and he preceding erses are rom he Philoc e a o Accius he Roman poe .




 I seems hard o say ha he is no in ol ed in e il, and ha serious e il, when compelled o cry ou in his way. n n
 n n
 
 VIII. Bu le us look a Hercules himsel who broke down under s ress o pain a he momen when dea h i sel was opening he ga e o immor ali y. Wha cries he u ers in he Trachiniae o Sophocles!



When Deianira had go he shir , s eeped in he Cen aur's blood, pu upon him and i had s uck o his lesh, he says:2

o my old age, I ollow he example gi en and make diligen use o our poe s; bu whene er hey ail me I ha e o en ransla ed rom he Greek ha La in speech migh no be wi hou any ornamen o his descrip ion. n n
 n n
 n n

 ransla ed rom he Greek poe s as well, ha La in eloquence migh no lack any embellishmen in his kind o discussion. n n
 n n
 
 Bu do you no e he harm which poe s do? They represen bra e men wailing, hey ener a e our souls, and besides his hey do i wi h such charm ha hey are no merely read, bu learn by hear . Thus when he in luence o he poe s is combined wi h bad amily discipline and a li e passed in he shade o e emina e seclusion, he s reng h o manliness is comple ely sapped. Pla o1 was righ hen in urning hem ou o his imaginary S a e, when he was rying o ind he highes morali y and he bes condi ions or he communi y. We, howe er, augh no doub by Greek example, bo h read and learn by hear rom boyhood he words o he poe s and regard such ins ruc ion and eaching as a ree man's heri age. n n
Pla o, Rep. II. 398 A.




 n n
 
 XII. Bu why are we angry wi h he poe s? Philosophers, he eachers o ir ue, ha e been ound ready o say ha pain was he highes e il. Bu you, young man, a er saying a li le while ago ha you shared his iew, when asked by me whe her you hough ha i was a grea er e il e en han disgrace, a a word2 abandoned your opinion. Pu he same ques ion o Epicurus: he will say ha a modera e degree o pain is worse e il han he deepes disgrace, or no e il is in ol ed in disgrace alone, unless i should be a ended by pain ul circums ances. Wha pain hen does Epicurus eel when he ac ually a irms ha pain is he grea es e il?3 And ye I canno look o ind any worse disgrace han such a sen imen in he mou h o a philosopher. You here ore ga e me all I wan ed when you replied ha you regarded disgrace as a n n
I.e., direc ly I had spoken, § 14.




For Epicurus said disgrace was no e il unless i was ollowed by pain; ye i pain e er a ends disgrace he ough o ha e su ered pain or saying wha he did.




 n n
 n
 
 grea er e il han pain. For i you hold as simply o his ru h you will realize he resis ance which mus be o ered o pain, and we mus no endea our so much o ask whe her pain be an e il as o s reng hen he soul or he endurance o pain. n n
 n n
 
 The S oics cons ruc oolish syllogisms1 o pro e pain no e il, jus as i he di icul y in ques ion were a erbal one and no one o ma er o ac . Why decei e me, Zeno?2 When you say ha wha is dread ul in my eyes is no an e il a all, I am a rac ed and long o know how i can be rue ha he condi ion I regard as u er wre chedness is no e en e il. “There is no hing e il,” says he, “excep wha is base and wicked.” Now you are alking oolishly, or you do no ake away he cause o my ormen : I know ha pain is no illainy; s op eaching me ha ; ell me ha i makes no di erence whe her I am in pain or no in pain. “I ne er makes any di erence,” says he, “ o he ac o leading a happy li e, which is based on ir ue alone; bu , all he same, pain is o be shunned.”3 Why? “I is unpleasing, agains na ure, hard o endure, melancholy, cruel.” n n
Such as-wha is e il hur s, wha hur s makes worse, pain does no make worse, here ore pain is no an e il-which may secure erbal assen bu does no con ince. C . § 42.

 XIII. Here is a lood o words, all o ge a number o di eren expressions or wha we call in a single word “e il.” You are gi ing me a de ini ion o pain, you are no remo ing i , when you say ha i is unpleasing, agains na ure, a hing ha can scarcely be borne or endured, and you do no lie. Bu you should no ha e really yielded he poin under a cloak o aun ing words. “No hing good bu wha is honourable, no hing e il bu wha is base”: his is mere aspira ion, no proo . The n n
 n n
 n
 
 be er and ruer s a emen is ha all such hings as na ure rejec s are coun ed e ils, all such hings as na ure accep s coun as goods.1 Once de ermine his and do away wi h he erbal con ro ersy,2 and i will be ound ha wha he S oics are righ in clinging o, wha we call honourable, righ , becoming, and some imes comprehend under he name o ir ue— his will s ill s and ou in such pre-eminence ha , in comparison, all hings which are held o be goods o body and or une will seem insigni ican and pal ry, whils i will also be ound ha no e il, e en i all e ils were heaped oge her, is o be compared wi h he e il o disgrace. n n
As Pla o, Aris o le and heir ollowers say.




Whe her pain is malum or rejec aneum.




 n n
 
 There ore i , as you admi ed a he ou se , disgrace is worse han pain,3 pain is clearly o no accoun ; or whils you shall hold i base and unwor hy o a man o groan, shriek aloud, wail, break down and be unner ed; so long as honour, so long as nobili y, so long as wor h remain, and so long as you con rol yoursel by keeping your eyes upon hem, assuredly pain will lead o ir ue and grow ain er by a delibera e e or o will; or ei her no ir ue exis s or all pain is o be despised. Do you belie e in he exis ence o prudence, wi hou which we canno so much as realize he meaning o any ir ue? Wha hen? Will prudence4 su er you o do any hing wi hou hereby gaining any ad an age and so only was ing e or uselessly; can i be ha emperance will allow you o ac wi hou sel -res rain ; can jus ice be prac ised by a man who discloses secre s, be rays accomplices, and urns his back on a mul i ude o obliga ions because o he iolence o pain? n n
§ 14.

 n n
 
 How, I ask, will you answer he n n
 n n
 n
 
 claims o courage and i s a endan rain, grea ness o soul, digni y, endurance and con emp o he icissi udes o li e? When you lie crushed and pros ra e, bemoaning your a e in pi i ul accen s, will you hear he words “O how bra e a man!” said o er you? I you are reduced o such s rai s no one will so much as say you are a man. Courage mus here ore go by he board or else a gra e be ound or pain. n n
 n n
 
 XIV. Are you hen unaware ha , i you lose one o your Corin hian ases,1 you can possess he res o your goods in sa e y, bu ha i you lose a single ir ue (and ye ir ue canno be los )2—s ill i you once admi here is a ir ue you do no possess,3 do you no know ha you will possess none a all? n n
Precious ases o me al. The Emperor Augus us was a collec or and called Corin hiarius, c . IV. § 32.




As o whe her ir ue could be los or no he S oics di ered. Clean hes said i was ἀναπόβλητον, Chrysippus ἀποβλητόν.




The S oic eaching was ha all he ir ues were inseparable and he man who had one, had all: Τὰς ἀρετὰς λέγουσιν οἱ Στωικοὶ ἀντακολουθεῖν ἀλλήλοις καὶ τὸν μίαν ἔχοντα πάσας ἔχειν (Diog. Laer . VII. 125). The wise man did all hings in accordance wi h all he ir ues.

 Can you hen possibly regard as a bra e man, as a man o high spiri , enduring, digni ied, as a man who despised or une, ei her he Philoc e es o he poem—? or I pre er no o ake you as my ins ance;4 bu ha was cer ainly no a bra e charac er, who lies

Where rom dumb walls re-echo pi eous sounds
O lamen a ion, plain s and groans and cries.
I do no deny he reali y o pain—why else should courage be wan ed?—bu I say ha i is o ercome by pa ience i only here is a measure o pa ience: i here is none, why do we glori y philosophy and why aun oursel es in i s name? Pain s ings—or i you like le i s rike deep; i you are de enceless, n n

 XV. There is some di erence be ween oil and pain; hey are cer ainly closely rela ed, bu here is a di erence: oil is a men al or physical execu ion o work or du y o more han usual se eri y; pain on he o her hand is disagreeable mo emen in he body, repugnan o he eelings. To hese wo hings our Greek riends, whose language is richer han ours, apply a single erm,4 and accordingly hey call diligen men de o ees o , or ra her lo ers o , pain;5 we n n
Greek has wo dis inc erms, πόνος, labor, and πόνος, dolor. A Greek migh ha e poin ed ou o Cicero ha laborare some imes has a meaning like ha o dolere, c . § 61, quod ehemen er ejus ar us laboraren . For similar remarks abou Greek and La in c . III. § 7.




φιλόπονος has he meaning o indus rius or laboriosus. In con ras o Cicero Lucre ius complains o pa rii sermonis eges as: so do Seneca and Quin ilian. The Greek Tiro, Cicero's amanuensis, reedman and riend, mus ha e been ra her aghas a hese remarks o his.




 n n
 n
 
 more ap ly call hem oilers, or oiling is one hing, eeling pain ano her. O Greece, you are some imes de icien in he words o which you hink you ha e such a plen i ul supply! oiling I say is one hing, eeling pain ano her. When C. Marius had his aricose eins cu ou he el pain;1 when he led his column under a blazing sun he was oiling. All he same here is a sor o resemblance be ween he wo hings, or he habi o oil renders he endurance o pain easier. n n
C . § 53. Marius was born o obscure paren age a Arpinum, Cicero's na i e place.




 n n
 
 Accordingly hose who ga e o Greece he speci ic orm o her go ernmen s were in a our o ha ing young men's bodies s reng hened by oil; he ci izens o Spar a applied he same rule o women, who in all o her ci ies lead a luxurious mode o li e and are “seques ered behind he shadow o walls.” The Spar ans, howe er, wished or no hing o ha sor

I ollows ha pain some imes in er enes in hese

Spar an girls were exercised in running, wres ling, and hrowing he discus and ja elin.

 Bu so ar I am dealing wi h he habi which comes rom raining, and no as ye wi h reasoned philosophy. Old women o en endure going wi hou ood or wo or hree days: ake away an a hle e's ood or a single day; he will en rea Olympian Jo e, he grea god in whose honour he is in raining; he will cry ou ha he canno endure i .

When hen his endurance is bo h required o bra e men and praised when ound, is i no base ei her o shrink rom he coming o pain or ail o bear i s isi a ion? And ye , perhaps, hough all righ -minded s a es are called ir ue, he erm is no appropria e o all ir ues, bu all ha e go he name rom he single ir ue which was ound o ou shine he res , or i is rom he word or “man” ha he word ir ue is deri ed; bu man's peculiar ir ue is or i ude, o which here are wo main unc ions, namely scorn o dea h and scorn o pain. These hen we mus n n

 You will perhaps ask how, and righ ly so, or such an ar o healing philosophy claims o possess.
XIX. Epicurus s eps orward,—in no sense an ill-meaning person, or ra her a gen leman o he bes in en ions, he gi es ad ice o he ex en o his abili y. “Ignore pain,” he says. Who says his? The same hinker who pronounces pain he highes e il. This is no qui e consis en . Le us lis en. “I pain is a i s highes ,” says he, “i mus be shor .”
“Repea ha once again o me!”1
For I do no qui e unders and wha you mean by “a i s highes ” and wha you mean by “shor .” “By ‘a he highes ’ I mean ha which has no hing higher; by ‘shor ’ I mean ha which has no hing shor er. I scorn a degree o pain rom which a brie space o ime will deli er me almos be ore i has come.” Bu wha i he pain be as se ere as ha o Philoc e es? “I admi i seems o me pre y se ere, bu all he same i is no a he highes ; or his pain is only in he oo ; here can be pain in he eyes, pain in he head, sides, lungs, pain e erywhere. He is here ore ar rom su ering pain a he highes .” “There ore,” says he, “con inuous pain admi s o more o gladness han o exa ion.”2 n n
From he Iliona o Pacu ius, c . I. § 106.




Diog. Laer . X. 140. αἱ πολυχρόνιοι τῶν ἀῤῥωστιῶν πλεόναζον ἔχουσι τὸ ἡδόμενον ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ ἤπερ τὸ ἀλγοῦν. Epicurus also said ha we hink many pains superior o pleasures whene er a grea er pleasure comes a er we ha e endured pains or a long ime.




 n n
 
 Now I canno say ha a man o his eminence is wi hou any sense, bu I hink he is mocking us. I say ha he highes pain—and I say “highes ” e en i here is ano her en a oms worse—, is no consequen ly shor , and I can name a number o wor hy men who, according o heir n n
 n n
 n
 
 own accoun , ha e su ered or ures o pain rom gou or se eral years. Bu he cunning rogue ne er ixes he limi ei her o he degree or he con inuance, so as o le me know wha he means by “highes ” in pain or “shor ” in ime. Le us hen pass him o er as saying absolu ely no hing and compel him o admi ha means o relie rom pain are no o be sough rom one who has pronounced pain o be he grea es o all e ils, howe er resolu ely he same person may show a ouch o bra ery in an a ack o colic or a di icul y in passing wa er.1 We mus hen seek or a remedy rom ano her quar er and principally, in ac , i we are looking or wha bes i s he case, rom hose2 in whose eyes he honourable is he highes good and he base he highes e il. In heir presence you will assuredly no dare o groan and oss abou in pain, or ir ue will i sel remons ra e wi h you by heir oice. n n

Will you, hough you ha e seen boys in Lacedaemon, young men a Olympia, barbarians in he arena submi ing o he hea ies blows and enduring hem in silence—will you, i some pain happen o gi e you a wi ch, cry ou like a woman and no endure resolu ely and calmly?—“I is unbearable; na ure canno pu up wi h i .”—Very well. Boys endure rom lo e o ame, o hers endure or shame's sake, many rom ear, and ye are we a raid ha na ure canno pu up wi h wha so many ha e endured in such a number o di eren places? Na ure in ac no only pu s up wi h bu e en demands i ; or she o ers no hing more excellen , no hing more desirable han honour, han renown, han dis inc ion, han glory. By all his number o erms here is only one hing ha I wan o express, n n
 n n
 n
 
 bu I employ a number, in order o make my meaning as clear as possible. Wha I wan o say in ac is ha ar he bes or man is ha which is desirable in and or i sel , has i s source in ir ue or ra her is based on ir ue, is o i sel praisewor hy, and in ac I should pre er o describe i as he only ra her han he highes good. Moreo er, jus as we use language like his in speaking o wha is honourable, so we use he opposi e in speaking o wha is base: here is no hing so re ol ing, no hing so despicable, no hing more unwor hy o a human being. n n
 n n
 
 And i you are so ar con inced— or you said a he ou se ha you hough here was more e il in disgrace han in pain—, i remains or you o be mas er o yoursel . And ye I do no know by wha righ we so express oursel es, jus as i we had wo sel es, one o be mas er and one o obey: s ill he phrase shows insigh , or he soul is di ided in o wo par s,1 one o which is gi ed wi h reason, while he o her is des i u e o i . n n

 XXI. When hen we are direc ed o be mas ers o oursel es, he meaning o he direc ion is ha reason should be a curb upon recklessness. As a rule, all men's minds con ain na urally an elemen o weakness, despondency, ser ili y, a kind o ner elessness and laccidi y. Had human na ure no hing else, no crea ure would be more hideous han man; bu reason, he mis ress and queen o he world, s ands close a hand and moun ing by her own s reng h and pressing onward she becomes comple ed ir ue. I is man's du y o enable reason o ha e rule o er ha par o he soul which ough o obey. n n

 “How is i o be done?” you will say. E en as he mas er n n

I he par o he soul, which I ha e described as yielding, conduc s i sel disgrace ully, i i gi e way in womanish ashion o lamen a ion and weeping, le i be e ered and igh ly bound by he guardianship o riends and rela ions; or o en we ind men crushed by a sense o shame a being o ercome wi hou any reason. Such persons here ore we shall ha e almos o keep in chains and guard closely like sla es, whils hose who shall be ound more s ead as , hough no o he highes s reng h, we shall ha e o warn o be mind ul o honour, like good soldiers recalled o du y. The wises hero o Greece when wounded does no wail ex ra agan ly, in he Nip ra;1 ra her should we say he shows due res rain in saying:

 March s ep by s ep e enly s raining n n
 Les rom a jol here seize me a keener n n

Pacu ius ransla ed or imi a ed a play o Sophocles (Νίπτρα ἢ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀκανθοπλήξ) in which he plo urns upon he dea h o Ulysses rom he bone o he s ing-ray sho by his son Telegonus.




 n n
 
 Pacu ius in his surpasses Sophocles— or in Sophocles he wounded Ulysses wails ery pi i ully: all he same he bearers o he wounded man, ha ing an eye o he digni y o his charac er, ac ually do no hesi a e o say o him when he so ly groans:

 You oo Ulysses albei grie ously n n
 S ricken we see, ye a well-nigh e emina e n n
 Spiri you show or a soldier o war are n n
 Li e-long accus omed. n n
 
The wise poe sees ha he cus om o bearing pain is a eacher no o be despised. n n
 n n
 
 And hen Ulysses no a all ex ra agan ly in his grea pain says: n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 
 Hold back! nay hold! o erpowering is he sore, n n
 Lay i bare; misery! I am in or ure. n n
 
 n n
 He begins o lose hold o himsel ; hen a once he pulls up: n n
 
 
 Co er up, co er up, and away or hwi h; n n
 Make ye despa ch; by your handling and shaking n n
 Ye increase he cruel pain o he wounded. n n
 
 n n
 Do you see how i is no he pain o he body which has been quie ed and reduced o silence, bu he pain o he soul which has been chas ened by rebuke and reduced o silence? And so a he end o he Nip ra1 he rebukes o hers as well, and ha in his las momen s:

 I be i s no o complain o ad erse or une or bemoan; n n
 This man's du y is: on women's na ure weeping was bes owed. n n
 
 n n
The i le Nip ra (washing) seems o poin o some scene in he play based on Odyssey 19. 349, where Euryclea washes he ee o Odysseus. C . V. § 45.

 The weaker par o his soul was submissi e o reason in he same way ha he disciplined soldier obeys he s ric commander.
XXII. Bu he man in whom here shall be per ec wisdom—we ha e ne er, i is rue, seen a li ing example hi her o, bu his charac er, i only one day he can be ound, is described in he words o philosophers—, such a wise man hen, or ra her such a reason as will be ound in him in comple e and per ec measure, will go ern he lower par o his na ure in he same way as a righ eous paren go erns sons o good charac er; he will secure he carrying ou o his wishes by a hin , wi hou rouble and wi hou exa ion; he will rouse and bes ir himsel , make ready and arm himsel o ace pain like an enemy. Wha are he weapons he will n n
 n n
 n
 
 need? He will brace and s reng hen and commune wi h himsel by saying, “Beware o any hing base, slack, unmanly.” n n
 n n
 
 Le he ideals which a rue man honours be kep cons an ly be ore his eyes: le him call up he image o Zeno o Elea1 who endured e ery ormen ra her han be brough o di ulge his accomplices in he plo o o er hrow yranny; le him re lec on he s ory o Anaxarchus2 he ollower o Democri us, who ell in o he power o King Timocreon in Cyprus, and wi hou appealing or mercy recoiled rom no orm o or ure. Callanus he Indian,3 an un u ored sa age, born a he oo o he Caucasus, o his own ree-will was burn ali e. We, on he con rary, canno bear a pain in he oo , or a oo hache (bu suppose he whole body is in pain); he reason is ha here is a kind o womanish and ri olous way o hinking exhibi ed in pleasure as much as in pain, which makes our sel -con rol mel and s ream away hrough weakness, and so we canno endure a bee-s ing wi hou crying ou . n n
No he ounder o he S oic philosophy, bu a na i e o Magna Graecia, abou 460 B. C.




Anaxarchus, a na i e o Thrace, was a companion o Alexander he Grea , and a er his dea h was killed by he King o Cyprus, Timocreon or Nicocreon.




Alexander he Grea made riends wi h Callanus a er he all o Babylon. Callanus was a gymnosophis , as he Greeks called he Hindu asce ic philosophers, c . V. § 77, and was said o ha e predic ed Alexander's dea h.

 Bu as a ma er o ac C. Marius, a coun ryman by ex rac ion ye undoub edly a man, when under he surgeon's kni e, as I rela ed earlier,4 re used rom he ou se o be bound, and here is no record o anyone be ore Marius ha ing been opera ed on wi hou being ied up. Why hen did o hers a erwards do like him? I was he orce o example. Do you see hen ha e il is a crea ure o he imagina ion, no a reali y o na ure? And ye he same Marius showed ha he s ing o he pain was se ere, or he did no o er his o her leg; hus being a man he bore pain, being human he re used o bear grea er pain wi hou ac ual necessi y. The whole poin hen is o be mas er o yoursel . n n

 Bu I ha e now made clear he charac er o sel -mas ery, and such considera ion o he conduc mos wor hy o endurance, courage and grea ness o soul no only subdues he lower par o he soul bu ac ually ser es somehow o mi iga e pain as well. n n

For, jus as i happens in ba le ha he cowardly and ain -hear ed soldier hrows away his shield as soon as he has caugh sigh o he enemy and lies as as as he can, and or ha reason loses his li e1 some imes wi hou e en a wound on his body, whereas no hing o he kind has happened meanwhile o he soldier who has s ood his ground: similarly hose who canno bear he sigh o pain hrow hemsel es away and lie s ricken and slain, whils hose on he o her hand who ha e aced he a ack ery o en qui he ield ic orious. For he soul has cer ain analogies o he body: weigh s are more easily carried by s raining e ery ner e o he body: relax he s rain and he weigh s are oo hea y; qui e similarly he soul by i s in ense2 e or hrows o all he pressure o burdens, bu by relaxa ion o e or is so weighed down ha i canno reco er i sel . n n

 And i we would ha e he ru h, he soul mus s rain e ery ner e in he per ormance o all du ies; in his alone does du y ind i s sa eguard. Bu he principal precau ion o be obser ed in he ma er o pain is o do no hing in a desponden , cowardly, slo h ul, ser ile or womanish spiri , and be ore all o resis and spurn hose Philoc e ean ou cries. Some imes, hough seldom, i is allowable or a man o groan aloud; o shriek, no e en or a woman; and his no doub is he orm o wailing o n n

 which he Twel e Tables orbade he use a unerals. n n
 n n
 
 Nor in ac does he bra e, wise man so much as e er groan aloud, unless perhaps o make an in ense e or or s ead as ness, in he way ha runners shou on he race-course as loudly as hey can. A hle es do he same in raining; boxers in ac , a he momen o s riking heir opponen , groan in he ac o swinging heir gaun le s, no ha hey eel pain or are losing hear , bu because by he burs o sound he whole body is made more ense and he blow comes wi h grea er orce.

 Grea hea ens, I ha e seen M. An onius,2 when s raining e ery ner e in de ence o himsel under he Varian law, ouch he ground wi h his knee. For jus as engines or hurling s ones and he o her machines or hrowing missiles gi e a more power ul discharge in propor ion o he igh ness o he s rain upon he cords,3 so i is wi h he oice, so i is wi h running, and he boxer's blow is hea ier in propor ion o he s rain exer ed. And as he e ec o s rain is so power ul, we shall indulge in a groan a an access o pain, i i can a ail o s reng hen he soul; bu i he groan is melancholy, weak, desponden , pi eous—I can scarcely gi e he name o man o him who has succumbed.

 XXV. Bu wha , you will say, ha e we in ime o n n

 peace, a home, in our easy chairs? You call me back o he philosophers who do no o en1 s ep in o he ba le-line, and one o whom, Dionysius o Heraclea,2 a person cer ainly o li le resolu ion, a er learning rom Zeno o be bra e was augh by pain o orge his lesson. For upon an a ack o kidney rouble, e en amid his shrieks, he kep on crying ou ha he opinions he had himsel pre iously held abou pain were alse. And on being asked by Clean hes,3 his ellow-pupil, wha was he reason ha had seduced him rom his ormer opinion, he replied: “Because i ,4 a er I had gi en such de o ed a en ion o philosophy, I ye pro ed unable o bear pain, ha would be su icien proo ha pain was an e il. Now I ha e spen many years in s udying philosophy and am unable o bear pain: pain is here ore an e il.” Then Clean hes s amped wi h his oo upon he ground and, according o he s ory, reci ed a line rom he Epigoni:5
Do you hear his, Amphiaraus, in your home benea h he ear h?
meaning Zeno and grie ing ha Dionysius was alse o his eaching. n n

 I was no so wi h our Posidonius,6 whom I ha e o en seen wi h my own eyes, and I shall repea he s ory Pompey liked o ell, ha a er reaching Rhodes on gi ing up Syria7 he el n n

 a wish o hear Posidonius; bu on learning ha he was seriously ill wi h an a ack o gou in he join s, he wished a all e en s o go o see so amous a philosopher when he had seen him and o ered his respec s, he paid him dis inguished complimen s and said ha he regre ed ha he was no able o hear him, bu Posidonius said, “You can hear me, nor will I su er bodily pain o be a reason or allowing a man o your eminence o isi me or no hing.” And accordingly Pompey rela ed ha rom his sick bed he philosopher had earnes ly and ully discussed his ery proposi ion, “ ha here is no hing good excep wha is honourable,” and as o en as a paroxysm o pain a acked him, con inually repea ed: “I is no use, pain! or all he dis ress you cause I shall ne er admi ha you are an e il.” n n
 n n
 
 XXVI. And in all cases all oils ha bring glory and dis inc ion are by he e or hey demand rendered endurable. Do we no see, wi h hose who hold in high es eem he spor s called gymnas ic, ha no pain is shunned by he compe i ors who en er or hem? Moreo er men wi h whom a name or hun ing and horsemanship is alued shrink rom no pain in heir cons an ques o his repu a ion. Why should I speak o our candida ure a elec ions, our desire or o ices o S a e? Would ire and wa er s op he men who once used o ga her in such prizes o e by o e?2 And so, A ricanus, who con inually had Xenophon, he ollower o Socra es, in his hand, used par icularly o praise him or saying ha he same oils in war were no equally se ere or general and soldier, because his posi ion alone made he oil n n

 n n
 
 Bu all he same i does come abou ha an imper ec no ion o honour has i s in luence wi h he unphilosophical ulgar, since hey canno see i s rue na ure; and so hey are swayed by repu a ion and he erdic o he mob in hinking ha honourable which he majori y would appro e. In your case, howe er, should you become a igure in he eyes o he mob, I should ne er heless no like you o be dependen on heir judgmen , nor wish you o accep heir iew o wha is aires : you mus use your own judgmen ; i you are con en wi h yoursel in appro ing he righ , hen you will no only win a ic ory o er sel , a rule I laid down a li le while back, bu o er he world o men and hings. n n
 n n
 
 Make his your aim: consider ha largeness o soul and, i I may say so, a cer ain exal a ion o soul o he highes possible pi ch, which bes shows i sel in scorn and con emp or pain, is he one aires hing in he world and all he airer, should i be independen o popular appro al and wi hou rying o win applause ne er heless ind joy in i sel . Nay more, o my mind all hings seem more praisewor hy which are done wi hou glori ica ion and wi hou publici y, no ha his is o be a oided— or all hings done well end o be se in he ligh o day—bu all he same here is no audience or ir ue o higher au hori y han he appro al o conscience. n n
 n n
 
 XXVII. Moreo er le us irs o all re lec upon his poin , ha he endurance o pain, which, as I ha e o en said, mus be s reng hened by an in ense e or o he soul, should show i sel a he same le el in e ery ield. For on many occasions numbers o men ha e bra ely recei ed and bra ely borne n n
 n n
 n
 
 wounds, ei her rom hirs or ic ory or ame, or e en o main ain heir own righ or reedom, and ye he same men, when he s rain o e or is relaxed, are unable o bear he pain o disease; he reason is ha he pain hey had readily endured, hey had endured, no rom principle or he eaching o philosophy, bu rom mo i es ra her o ambi ion and ame. We ind accordingly some unci ilized barbarians able o igh despera ely o he end wi h he sword bu unable o beha e like men in sickness. The Greeks on he o her hand, who are no so ery courageous bu ha e a su iciency o sense answering o heir men al powers, canno look an enemy in he ace;1 and ye hese same men show endurance and spiri , as human beings should, in bearing sickness, while he Cimbri and Cel iberians2 re el in ba le and wail in sickness. For no hing can keep he same le el unless i s ar s wi h ixed principle. n n
Aris o le, Pol. 4. 7. 3, says ha he Greek race was bo h ἔνθυμον καὶ διανοητικόν, no like he nor hern races who were courageous bu unin ellec ual, or he Asia ics who were in ellec ual bu spiri less.




The Cimbri were German, he Cel iberi Spanish.




 n n
 
 Bu since one inds ha men ac ing rom ambi ion or upon un eri ied opinion do no break down under pain in he pursui and a ainmen o heir objec , i should be a du y o hink ei her ha pain is no an e il, or e en i i should be decided o gi e he name o pain o all ha is unpleasan and unna ural, ne er heless, ha his is o such ri ling impor ance ha i is eclipsed by ir ue so comple ely as o be nowhere isible. Re lec on hese considera ions, I pray, by day and nigh , or his principle will spread more widely in i s applica ion and co er a ield a good deal larger han he considera ion o pain alone; or i we are o do e ery hing wi h he objec o a oiding baseness and securing honour, we shall ha e he righ o despising no merely he s ings o pain bu he bol s o or une as well, especially n n
 n n
 n
 
 as such a mansion o re uge has been prepared or us as a resul o yes erday's discussion. n n
 n n
 
 For i a god should say o some na iga or con ron ed wi h a chase by pira es: “Cas yoursel rom he ship; here is ei her a dolphin ready o pick you up like Arion o Me hymna,1 or else he amous horses o Nep une, which aided Pelops and are said o ha e hurried he car a loa o er he wa es,’2 will pick you up and carry you whi her you will,” he would cas o all ear; similarly when unpleasing and ha e ul pains assail you, i hey should be oo keen o be borne, you see he re uge o which you mus ly. This is pre y nearly wha I hough should be said in he ime a ailable. Bu i may be you adhere o your opinion. A. By no means so, and i is my hope ha I ha e in wo days been se ree rom he ear o wo hings o which I was despera ely a raid. M. To-morrow hen we will prac ise declama ion by he wa er-clock, or so we ha e arranged and I see ha his canno be re used you. A.

Is i because wi h he soul we judge o bodily lassi ude and pain, whils wi h he body we canno realize he sickness o he soul? The resul is ha he soul passes judgmen upon i s own condi ion a a momen when he ac ual ins rumen o judgmen is sick. n n

And hen how can we accep he no ion ha he soul canno heal i sel , seeing ha he soul has disco ered he ac ual ar o healing he body, and seeing ha men's cons i u ions o hemsel es, as well as na ure, con ribu e a good deal o he cure o he body, and no all o hose who ha e submi ed o rea men succeed a once in making reco ery as well,1 whereas we see, on he con rary, ha souls which ha e been ready o be cured and ha e obeyed he ins ruc ions o wise men, are undoub edly cured? n n
As we read now in newspapers, “The opera ion was carried ou success ully, bu he pa ien subsequen ly succumbed rom weakness.”

 o dis ress.1 M. Surely no o he o her disorders o he soul oo, errors, lus s, i s o anger? These belong, speaking generally, o he class o emo ions which he Greeks erm πάθη: I migh ha e called hem “diseases,” and his would be a word- or-word rendering:2 bu i would no i in wi h La in usage. For pi y, en y, exul a ion, joy,3 all hese he Greeks erm diseases, mo emen s ha is o he soul which are no obedien o reason;4 we on he o her hand should, I hink, righ ly say ha hese same mo emen s o an agi a ed soul are “disorders,” bu no “diseases” in he ordinary way o speaking, unless you are o ano her opinion. n n
Aegri udo ransla es he Greek λύπη, c . § 83 or i s orms. Tris i ia, “sorrow,” is S . Augus ine's word, c . § 77.




νόσος (c . IV. § 23 νόσημα) is he equi alen o morbus and πάθος o per urba io. For a similar error due o Cicero's zeal in de ence o La in c . II. § 35. As a ma er o ac Greek is be er able o express he abs rac no ions o philosophy han La in, c . I. § 22. The S oics dis inguished our classes o πάθη (irra ional emo ions) gi en in Virg. Aen. 6. 733. Hinc me uun cupiun que dolen gauden que. The S oic order was ἐπιθυμία, φόβος, λύπη, ἡδονή.




These would be πάθη coming under he head o λύπη, aegri udo, and no allowable in he wise man who was ἀπαθής and did no eel desire, grie , anger or joy. The Peripa e ics and Academy hough ha hese emo ions were na ural in origin bu needed res rain .

 A. I hink as you do. M. Do you hink ha hese emo ions come upon he wise man? A. Unques ionably so, I hink. M. 'Pon my word, ha aun ed wisdom o yours is no o be ra ed a a high alue, as i is much he same as unsoundness o mind.5 A. Wha do you mean? Do you regard e ery agi a ion o he soul as unsoundness o mind?

 n n
 
 Now philosophers apply he erm disease o all disorders o he soul and hey say ha no oolish person is ree rom such diseases; su erers rom disease, howe er, are no sound, and he souls o all unwise persons are diseased: here ore all unwise persons are o “unsound” mind]. For hey1 considered ha he sound heal h o souls consis ed in a s a e o equable calm: hey applied he erm “unsoundness” o he mind ha was no in his s a e, because hey hough ha in a disordered soul, as in a disordered body, soundness o heal h was impossible. n n
Our ances ors.




 n n
 
 V. And here was no less insigh in heir gi ing o a condi ion o he soul, marked by an absence o he illumina ing in luence o he mind, he name o “mindlessness” as well as “aberra ion o mind”:2 and rom his we mus unders and ha hose who ga e hese names o such condi ions held he iew which he S oics ook rom Socra es and s eadily adhered o, ha all unwise persons are in an “unsound” s a e. For he soul which is su ering rom some disease—now philosophers as I ha e said apply he erm disease o hese disordered mo emen s —is no more in a sound condi ion han he body which is diseased. I ollows ha wisdom is a sound condi ion o he soul, unwisdom on he o her hand a sor o unheal hiness which is unsoundness and also aberra ion o mind; and hese a ribu es are much be er conno ed by he La in erms han by he Greek, as will be ound also in many o her ins ances.3 Bu o ha elsewhere; now or he business in hand. n n
Amens is he man whose mind has gone: demens he man whose mind has wandered rom he righ way.




In II. § 35 he cri icizes Greek erms in comparison wi h La in. Here his poin seems o be ha he La in erms emphasize be er han Greek he loss o heal hiness and in ellec ha a disordered mind implies. He orge s ἄφρων and παράνοια. Tiro, his Greek secre ary, could ha e old him.




 n n
 n
 
 The na ure hen and meaning o he whole ques ion a issue is shown by he exac orce o he erm.1 For seeing ha i mus be unders ood ha hose, whose mind has no been hrown in o disorder by any mo emen o he na ure o a disease, are in a “sound” condi ion, he erm “unsound” mus be applied o hose who on he con rary are su ering rom disorder. Consequen ly here is no hing be er han he usage o he La in language, where we say ha hose who are unbridled in he indulgence o ei her lus or wra h are beside hemsel es2 ( hough in ac wra h i sel comes under he head o lus , or he de ini ion o wra h is lus o engeance).3 Those hen who are described as beside hemsel es are so described because hey are no under he con rol o mind o which he empire o he whole soul has been assigned by na ure. Now I canno readily gi e he origin o he Greek erm μανία:4 he meaning i ac ually implies is marked wi h be er discrimina ion by us han by he Greeks, or we make a dis inc ion be ween “unsoundness” o mind, which rom i s associa ion wi h olly has a wider conno a ion, and “ renzy.” The Greeks wish o make he dis inc ion bu all shor o success in he erm hey employ: wha we call renzy hey call μελαγχολία,5 jus as i he ru h were ha he mind is in luenced by black bile and no in many ins ances by he s ronger power o wra h or ear or pain, in he sense in which we speak o he renzy o A hamas, Alcmaeon, Ajax and Ores es.6 Whosoe er is so a lic ed is no allowed by he Twel e Tables7 o n n

And hough his seems o be worse han unsoundness o mind, ne er heless here is his o be no ed, ha renzy can come upon he wise man, unsoundness o mind canno .1 Bu his is a di eren problem: le us re urn o our subjec . n n
The wise man, according o he S oics, could no become insane, or insani y is he same as olly, and he wise man could no be oolish. He was s ill a wise man when he was asleep, and similarly he main ained his i le e en i a acked wi h renzy.

 VII. The bra e man is also sel -relian ; or “con iden ” is by a mis aken usage o speech used in a bad sense, hough he word is deri ed rom con idere, “ o ha e rus ,” which implies praise. The sel -relian man, howe er, is assuredly no excessi ely ear ul; or here is a di erence be ween con idence and imidi y. And ye he man who is accessible o dis ress is also accessible o ear. For where hings cause us dis ress by heir presence, we are also n n
 n n
 
 
 n n
 n n\nn
 
 
 a raid o he menace o heir approach. So i comes ha dis ress is incompa ible wi h or i ude. I is here ore probable ha he man who is suscep ible o dis ress is also suscep ible o ear, and indeed o dejec ion and depression o soul. Where men are suscep ible o hese emo ions here also comes a eeling o subjec ion, a readiness o admi hemsel es bea en should occasion arise. He who makes his admission has o admi ear and cowardice as well. Bu o such eelings he bra e man is no suscep ible: here ore he is no suscep ible o dis ress ei her. Bu no one is wise i he is no bra e. There ore he wise man will no be suscep ible o dis ress. n n
 n n
 
 Moreo er he bra e man mus also be high-souled, and he high-souled mus be unconquered; and he unconquered mus look down on human icissi udes and consider hem benea h him. Bu no one can look down upon he hings which can make him su er dis ress. And rom his i ollows ha he bra e man ne er su ers dis ress. Bu all wise men are bra e. There ore he wise man is no suscep ible o dis ress. And jus as he eye, i ou o order, is no in a righ condi ion or discharging i s unc ion, and he o her members, or he body as a whole, i i is no in i s normal condi ion, ails o per orm i s unc ion and work: similarly he soul, i disquie ed, is no i ed o carry ou i s work. Bu he work o he soul is he righ use o reason, and he soul o he wise man is always in a condi ion o make he bes use o reason. There ore i is ne er in a disordered s a e. Bu dis ress is a disorder o he soul. There ore he wise man will always be ree rom i . n n
 n n
 
 VIII. I is also probable ha he empera e man1 n n
The argumen loses i sel in a long digression on erminology wri en in he con ersa ional irregular s yle, which Cicero o en adop s in his dialogues, and is only resumed in § 18 wi h he words Qui si rugi igi ur.




 n n
 n
 
 - he Greeks call him σώφρων, and hey apply he erm σωφροσύνη o he ir ue which I usually call, some imes emperance, some imes sel -con rol, and occasionally also discre ion; bu , i may be, he ir ue could righ ly be called “ rugali y,”1 he erm corresponding o which has a narrower meaning wi h he Greeks, who call “ rugal” men χρήσιμοι, ha is o say simply use ul; bu our erm has a wider meaning, or i conno es all abs inence and ino ensi eness (and his wi h he Greeks has no cus omary erm, bu i is possible o use ἀβλάβεια, harmlessness; or ino ensi eness is a disposi ion o he soul o injure no one)—well, “ rugali y” embraces all he o her ir ues as well; had i s meaning no been so comprehensi e and had i been con ined o he narrow limi s o ordinary accep a ion,2 i would ne er ha e become he much eulogized surname o L. Piso.3 n n
Frugi, rugali as are words which describe he ir ue o he older Romans. Applied o a ield rugi means ha i is produc i e; when rans erred o human beings i means an uprigh , energe ic, pruden , sel -con rolled man who keeps he righ measure in all ha he does, c . IV. § 36. Frugi was he surname gi en o L. Piso: i could also be applied o good sla es. The meaning o rugali as in he main is ha o σωφροσύνη, or ha ir ue bids us use righ reason in all ha we under ake, and implies emperance, sel -con rol, modera ion, s ead as ness and con inence.




i.e. "economical," as in Horace, Sa . 1. 3. 49, Parcius hic i i , rugi dica ur.




Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who gained he cognomen o Frugi, was Consul 133 B.C.




 n n
 
 Bu because nei her he man who hrough ear has deser ed his pos , which is a proo o cowardice, nor he man who hrough a arice has ailed o res ore a rus pri a ely commi ed o him, which is a proo o unrigh eousness, nor he man who hrough rashness has mismanaged a business ransac ion, which is a proo o olly, are usually called “ rugal,” “ rugali y” has come o include he hree ir ues o or i ude, jus ice and prudence: ( hough his is a ea ure common o he ir ues; or n n
 n n
 n
 
 hey are all mu ually linked and bound oge her).1 There ore I coun “ rugali y” by i sel as le o be he our h ir ue. For i seems o be i s special unc ion o guide and compose he eager impulses o he soul and, by a cons an opposi ion o lus , o preser e on e ery occasion a empered irmness: and he ice which is i s opposi e is “wor hlessness.” n n
The ir ues o erlap. In Pla o, Gorgias 507, Socra es argues ha ὁ σώφρων τὰ προσήκοντα πράττοι ἂν καὶ περὶ θεοὺς καὶ περὶ ἀνθρώπους. I he empera e man per orms his du ies o men, he will also be jus , and i he a oids and pursues he hings he ough o, he will also be courageous. The “ rugal” man, Cicero says, shows or i ude, jus ice and prudence. “Frugali y” embraces hese hree and also has i s own peculiar quali y, here ore, says Cicero, “ rugali y” is le or he our h ir ue, emperance. Bu i canno be said ha his " here ore" is clear.




 n n
 
 “Frugali y,” as I hink, is deri ed rom “ rui ” and no hing be er comes rom he ear h: “wor hlessness” is deri ed ( he deri a ion, i may be, will be somewha harsh; bu all he same le us make he a emp ; le i be aken as a jes i i should come o no hing) rom ha which is nequidquam, “ or no hing,” in a man o ha kind; hence he is also said o be “good or no hing.” The man here ore who is “ rugal” or, should you pre er i , sel -res rained and empera e mus be irm; he irm man mus be calm; he calm man mus be ree rom all dis urbance, here ore ree rom dis ress as well. All hese are charac eris ic o he wise man. There ore dis ress will keep ar away rom he wise man. n n
 n n
 
 IX. And so in dealing wi h he passage in Homer where Achilles lamen s o his e ec , I hink:

 Big is he hear in my breas wi h a gloomy swelling o anger, n n
 When I remember ha I ha e been robbed o my honour and glory,2 n n
 
Dionysius o Heraclea3 argues no unskil ully—
Can he hand be in a righ condi ion when su ering rom a swelling? or can any o her limb ail o be n n
Il. 9. 646.




C . II. § 60.




 n n
 n
 
 de ec i e when in a swollen and in lamed s a e? Similarly hen he soul, when pu ed up and swollen, is in a de ec i e s a e. Bu he soul o he wise man is always ree rom de ec and ne er in an in lamed, ne er in a swollen s a e; bu his is he condi ion o he angry soul: here ore he wise man is ne er angry.1 For i he is angry he is also co e ous. The co e ousness peculiar o he angry man is he desire o s amp he brand o u ermos pain upon he person by whom he considers himsel injured. Moreo er he man who has co e ed his end mus necessarily be grea ly rejoiced i he has secured i . Hence i comes abou ha he rejoices in ano her's mis or une. As he wise man is incapable o his, he is also incapable o eeling anger ei her. Bu should he wise man be suscep ible o dis ress, he would also be suscep ible o anger, and as he is ree rom anger he will also be ree rom dis ress. n n
C . § 11.




 n n
 
 For i he wise man could be capable o eeling dis ress he could be also o eeling compassion,2 he could eel en y. (I ha e no said in idia or en y, as i is used where a person is he objec o en y; he word in iden ia, howe er, deri ed rom in idere, can be righ ly used o a oid he ambigui y o in idia3 which comes rom eyeing he prosperi y o a ri al oo narrowly, as in he Melanippus:4

 Who has looked askance upon he promise o my children? n n
 
Bad La in, i seems; bu admirably said by Accius; or jus as idere, “ o look a ,” akes he accusa i e, so in idere lorem, “ o look askance upon he promise,” is ruer han he use o lori he da i e. Nos n n
For compassion and en y come under he head o he πάθος aegri udo, λύπη. In he Pro Ligario, howe er, speaking in praise o Caesar, Cicero says, Nulla de uis ir u ibus plurimis nec gra ior nec admirabilior misericordia es .




In idia has wo senses, al era in idum, al era in idiosum aci , " he one makes an en ious man, he o her a man who rouses en y," Quin . VI. 2. 21. In idere in he Melanippus has he meaning o βασκαίνειν, ascinare, " o cas an e il eye on."




The Melanippus was a play o Accius, I. § 105.




 n n
 n
 
 The usage o language bars us rom doing his; he poe has claimed his righ and spoken wi h grea er reedom.)1 n n
The passage in bracke s is an explana ion o Cicero's, paren he ical o he commen o Dionysius o Heraclea on he passage o Homer.




 n n
 
 X. The same person here ore is suscep ible o pi y and en y. For he man who is pained by ano her's mis or unes is also pained by ano her's prosperi y. For ins ance, Theophras us in lamen ing he dea h o his riend Callis henes2 is exed a he prosperi y o Alexander; and so he says ha Callis henes ell in wi h a man o supreme power and unparalleled good or une, bu one who did no know how o urn prosperi y o good accoun . And ye , as compassion is dis ress due o a neighbour's mis or unes, en y is dis ress due o a neighbour's prosperi y. There ore he man who comes o eel compassion comes also o eel en y. The wise man, howe er, does no come o eel en y; here ore he does no come o eel compassion ei her. Bu i he wise man were accus omed o eel dis ress he would also be accus omed o eel compassion. There ore dis ress keeps away rom he wise man. n n

For as he body, i modera ely ailing, is no heal hy;2 so in he soul he so-called mean or modera e s a e is wi hou heal h. And so our coun rymen, as in many o her ins ances, showed a ine ins inc in gi ing he name o "dis ress" o exa ion, anxie y, and anguish, because o heir resemblance o he condi ion o bodies ou o heal h. n n

 By almos he same erm he Greeks describe all dis urbance o he soul; or hey use πάθος,3 ha is o say, "disease," or any roubled mo emen wha e er in he soul. We do be er; or dis ress o soul closely resembles he condi ion o bodies ou o heal h; bu lus does no resemble sickness, in empera e joy does no , which is an exci ed and exuberan pleasure o he soul. Ac ual ear oo is no ery like disease, hough closely akin o dis ress. Bu i is appropria e ha , like sickness in he body, so dis ress in he soul has a name which in meaning is no dis inc rom he meaning o pain. We mus here ore race ou he origin o his pain which is he e icien cause o dis ress in he soul, as i we were diagnosing sickness in he body. For physicians consider ha , when hey ha e disco ered he cause o disease, hey ha e also disco ered he me hod o rea ing i , and similarly we, when we n n

 XI. I is hen wholly in an idea ha we ind he cause no merely indeed o dis ress bu o all o her dis urbances as well, and hese can be classi ied as our wi h numerous subdi isions. For as all dis urbance is a mo emen o he soul ei her des i u e o reason, or con emp uous o reason, or disobedien o reason, and as such a mo emen is pro oked in wo ways, ei her by an idea o good or idea o e il, we ha e our dis urbances equally di ided. For here are wo proceeding rom an idea o good, one o which is exuberan pleasure, ha is o say, joy exci ed beyond measure by he idea o some grea presen good; he second is he in empera e longing or a supposed grea good, and his longing is disobedien o reason, and may be righ ly ermed desire or lus . n n
 n n
 
 There ore hese wo classes, exuberan pleasure and lus springing rom he idea o good, dis urb he soul jus as he wo remaining, ear and dis ress, cause dis urbances by he idea o e il. For ear is he idea o a serious hrea ening e il and dis ress is he idea o a serious presen e il and indeed an idea reshly concei ed o an e il o such sor ha i seems a due reason or anguish; now ha means ha he man who eels he pain belie es ha he ough o eel pain. We mus , howe er, wi h all our migh and main resis hese dis urbances which olly looses and launches like a kind o e il spiri upon he li e o mankind, i we wish o pass our allo ed span in peace and quie .

 n n
 
 XIII. Do you suppose hen ha here is any possibili y o he wise man being o erwhelmed wi h dis ress, ha is o say, wi h wre chedness? Indeed, while all dis urbance is wre chedness, “dis ress” means being ac ually pu upon he rack. Lus in ol es passion, exuberan joy ri oli y, ear degrada ion; bu dis ress in ol es worse hings, i means decay, or ure, agony, hideousness; i rends and corrodes he soul and brings i o absolu e ruin. Unless we s rip i o 3 and manage o ling i away we canno be ree rom wre chedness. n n
C . II. § 20.




 n n
 
 Moreo er his a any ra e is clear, ha dis ress arises rom he impression o some grea e il which seems o be closely bese ing us. Now Epicurus holds ha he dis ress which he idea o e il pro- n n
 n n
 n
 
 duces is a na ural1 e ec , in he sense ha anyone who con empla es some considerable e il a once eels dis ress, should he imagine ha i has be allen him. n n
Na ural and necessary, Gk. φυσικός. The S oics held dis ress o be con rary o na ure and olun ary.




 n n
 
 The Cyrenaics consider ha dis ress is no caused by e ery e il bu by an unlooked or and unexpec ed e il. Tha , i is rue, has no ordinary e ec in heigh ening dis ress, or all sudden isi a ions seem more serious han o hers. Hence i is ha hese lines are righ ly praised:2
 
 I bega hem and bege ing knew ha hem or dea h I reared. n n
 Also when o Troy I sen hem Greece o igh or and de end, n n
 Well I knew o deadly war are no or eas ing sen I hem. n n
 
 n n
By he Cyrenaics, c . II. § 15, as showing ha e ils an icipa ed are no so dis ressing as unexpec ed e ils. The lines are rom a play o Ennius, where Telamon is speaking o his sons Ajax and Teucer, whom he had sen o war.

 This saying shows ha such e en s are cruel or hose who ha e no re lec ed upon hem. There ore i does no admi o doub ha e ery hing which is hough e il is more grie ous i i comes unexpec edly.2 And so, hough his is no he one cause o he grea es dis ress, ye as oresigh and an icipa ion ha e considerable e ec in lessening pain, a human being should ponder all he icissi udes ha all o man's lo . And do no doub ha here is ound he ideal o ha wisdom which excels and is di ine, namely in he horough s udy and comprehension o human icissi udes, in being as onished a no hing when i happens, and in hinking, be ore he e en is come, ha here is no hing which may no come o pass.

And his was in no way he se ere brow o our old M.

 And here ore, or my par , in con ron ing he changes and chances o li e I accep indeed rom he Cyrenaics such weapons as hey pro ide o enable me, wi h he help o long pre ious considera ion, o break he coming o li e's assaul s, and a he same ime I judge he e il we speak o o lie in belie and no in na ure; or i i were downrigh reali y, why should i be rendered ligh er by an icipa ion? n n
 n n
 
 Bu a more accura e s a emen upon his same subjec is possible, i we irs consider he opinion o Epicurus, who supposes ha all men mus necessarily eel dis ress, i hey hink hemsel es encompassed by e ils, whe her pre iously oreseen and an icipa ed, or long es ablished. For according o him e ils are no lessened by dura ion nor ligh ened by pre ious considera ion, and besides, he hinks i olly o dwell upon an e il which has s ill o come or maybe will no come a all; all e il, he says, is ha e ul enough when i has come; bu he man, who is always hinking a mishap may come, is making ha e il perpe ual: bu i i is no des ined o come a all, he is needlessly he ic im o a n n
 n n
 n
 
 wre chedness he has brough upon himsel : hus he is always or ured ei her by undergoing or by re lec ing on he e il. n n
 n n
 
 Alle ia ion o dis ress, howe er, Epicurus inds in wo direc ions, namely in calling he soul away rom re lec ion upon exa ion and in a “recall”1 o he considera ion o pleasures. For he hinks he soul able o obey reason and ollow i s guidance. Reason here ore (in his iew) orbids a en ion o exa ions, wi hdraws he soul rom morose re lec ions, blun s i s keenness in dwelling upon wre chedness and, sounding a re rea rom such hough s, eagerly urges i on again o descry a arie y o pleasures and engage in hem wi h all he powers o he mind; and according o his philosopher he wise man's li e is packed wi h he recollec ion o pas and he prospec o u ure pleasures. This iew we ha e s a ed in our usual s yle, he Epicureans s a e i in heirs. Bu le us look a heir meaning; heir s yle2 le us ignore. n n
Re oca io is a mili ary me aphor, e.g. recep ui signum au re oca ionem a bello audire non possumus, c . II. § 48. The word is used o calling anyone back rom a course he has begun o an earlier righ course.




Which was uncul i a ed, or Epicurus said, Παιδείαν πᾶσαν, μακάριε, φεύγε.

 XVI. In he irs place hey are wrong in censuring he considera ion o e ils be orehand. For here is no hing so well i ed o deaden and alle ia e dis ress as he con inual li e-long re lec ion ha here is no e en which may no happen; no hing so ser iceable as he considera ion o our s a e as human beings, as he s udy o he law o our being and he prac ice o obedience o i ; and he e ec o his is no o make us always sad bu o pre en us rom being so a all. For he man who re lec s upon na ure, upon he di ersi y o li e and he weakness o humani y, is no saddened by re lec ing upon hese hings, bu in doing so he ul ils mos comple ely he unc ion o wisdom. For he gains doubly, in ha by considering he icissi udes o n n
 n n
 n
 
 human li e he has he enjoymen o he peculiar du y o philosophy, and in ad ersi y he inds a hree old relie o aid his res ora ion; n n
 n n
 
 irs because he has long since re lec ed on he possibili y o mishap, and his is ar he bes me hod o lessening and weakening all exa ion; secondly because he unders ands ha he lo o man mus be endured in he spiri o a man; las ly because he sees ha here is no e il bu guil , bu ha here is no guil when he issue is one agains which he can ha e no guaran ee.1 As or ha "recall" which Epicurus ad ises, when he calls us away rom he con empla ion o e il, I do no add i , or i is null and oid. For under he smar o circums ances which we regard as e il, concealmen or orge ulness is no wi hin our con rol: circums ances ear us in pieces, worry and goad us; heir ouch is iery; hey do no allow us o brea he. And do you, Epicurus, bid me " orge ," hough o orge is con rary o na ure, while you wres rom my grasp he aid which na ure has supplied or he relie o long-s anding pain? For here is a remedy, slow-working i is rue bu e ec ual, brough abou by he long lapse o ime. You bid me re lec on good, orge e il. There would be some hing in wha you say and some hing wor hy o a grea philosopher, were you sensible ha hose hings are good which are mos wor hy o a human being. n n

 He does say his, and so ha li le spi ire Zeno,1 who had he keenes in ellec o hem all, used in his old age o insis a he op o his oice in my hearing a A hens— ha he was happy who had he enjoymen o presen pleasure and he assurance ha he would ha e enjoymen ei her hroughou li e or or a grea par o li e wi hou he in er en ion o pain, or, should pain come, ha i would be shor -li ed i ex reme, bu i prolonged i would imply more ha was pleasan han e il;2 re lec ion on his would make him happy, par icularly i he had had he sa is ac ion o good hings pre iously enjoyed and were wi hou undue ear o dea h or gods. n n

C . II. § 44.




 n n
 
 You ha e Epicurus' no ion o a happy li e, as ormula ed in he words o Zeno, so ha here is no possibili y o denial.
Wha hen? Will he idea and hough o such a li e a ail o relie e ei her Thyes es or Aee es o whom I spoke a li le while back, or Telamon banished rom his coun ry o be an exile, and a needy one as well, a sigh o whom men asked in as onishmen :

 See we here he amous Telamon whom o hea en glory raised, n n
 Whom men gazed on and Greek aces owards his ace were e er urned? n n
 
 n n
 n n
 
 Bu i anyone ind, as he same poe says, ha “spiri a once wi h or une alls,” he mus look or a remedy rom hose earnes philosophers o old, no rom hese de o ees o pleasure. For wha do hese ri lers mean by abundance o good? Suppose, i n n
 n n
 n
 
 you like, ha he highes good is absence o pain; al hough ha is no ermed pleasure1 bu here is no need o go in o e ery hing now—is i o his we ha e been led on o ind relie or sorrow? Gran , i you like, ha pain is he highes e il; does he man who is no in pain a once enjoy he highes good i he be ree rom e il? n n
For i is an in ermedia e s a e o nei her joy nor pain.




 n n
 
 Why do we shirk he ques ion, Epicurus, and why do we no con ess ha we mean by pleasure wha you habi ually say i is, when you ha e hrown o all sense o shame? Are hese your words or no ? For ins ance, in ha book which embraces all your eaching ( or I shall now play he par o ransla or, ha no one may hink I am in en ing) you say his: “For my par I ind no meaning which I can a ach o wha is ermed good, i I ake away rom i he pleasures ob ained by as e, i I ake away he pleasures which come rom lis ening o music, i I ake away oo he charm deri ed by he eyes rom he sigh o igures in mo emen ,2 or o her pleasures produced by any o he senses in he whole man. Nor indeed is i possible o make such a s a emen as his— ha i is joy o he mind which is alone o be reckoned as a good; or I unders and by a mind in a s a e o joy, ha i is so, when i has he hope o all he pleasures I ha e named— ha is o say he hope ha na ure will be ree o enjoy hem wi hou any blending o pain.” n n
e.g. he dancing o he daugh er o Herodias, Ma h. xi . 6. Epicurus' own words were, οὐ γὰρ ἔγωγε δύναμαι νοῆσαι τἀγαθὸν ἀφαιρῶν μὲν τὰς διὰ χυλῶν ἡδονάς, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ τὰς δι᾽ ἀφροδισίων, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ τὰς δι᾽ ἀκροαμάτων, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ τὰς διὰ μορφῆς κατ᾽ ὄψιν ἡδείας κινήσεις, A hen. VII. 280.




 n n
 
 And his much he says in he words I ha e quo ed, so ha anyone you please may realize wha Epicurus unders ands by pleasure. Then a li le lower: “I ha e o en,” he says, “asked men who were called wise wha con en could be le in a good, i hey ook away he ad an ages named, unless i were o be supposed ha i was n n
 n n
 n
 
 heir wish o u er sen ences des i u e o meaning; I ha e been able o learn no hing rom men who, i hey choose o go on babbling abou ' ir ues' or 'wisdoms,'1 will mean no hing bu he way in which he pleasures I ha e named are brough abou .” n n
They alk grandiloquen ly abou ir ue, bu all hey mean is ha ir ue is use ul or securing pleasure; c . De Fin. V. § 80: Dixeri hoc idem Epicurus, semper bea um esse sapien em; quod quidem sole ebullire nonnunquam, and Mad ig's no e.




 n n
 
 Wha ollows is o he same e ec , and he whole book, which deals wi h he highes good,2 is packed wi h words and sen imen s o similar charac er. Is his hen he li e o which you will “recall” he hero Telamon or he relie o his dis ress? and, i you ind any o your rela i es broken down by grie , will you gi e him a s urgeon3 ra her han a Socra ic rea ise, will you urge him o lis en o he music o a wa er organ ra her han ha o Pla o, will you se ou ariega ed blooms or him o look a , will you hold a nosegay o his nos rils, burn spices and bid him wrea he his head wi h garlands and roses?

Le us pop her in o a ea her-bed, bring in a harpis , burn a pla er o Coan pas illes, look ou a drop o soo hing syrup and some hing o ea . Here we ha e a las he good hings which enable us o ge rid o he mos grie ous dis resses. For you explained a li le while ago ha you did no e en unders and any o hers. I should here ore agree wi h Epicurus abou he du y o a “recall” rom mourning o re lec ion upon wha was good, i we were agreed upon he meaning o good. n n
 n n
 
 Someone will say: Wha hen? Do you hink Epicurus mean ha sor o hing, or ha his iews were licen ious? I cer ainly do no . For I see ha many o his u erances brea he an aus ere and many a noble spiri .1 Consequen ly, as I ha e o en said, he ques ion a issue is his in elligence, no his morali y. Howe er much he may scorn he pleasures he has jus appro ed, ye I shall remember wha i was ha he hinks he highes good. For he has no only used he erm pleasure, bu s a ed clearly wha he mean by i . “Tas e,” he says, “and embraces and spec acles and music and he shapes o objec s i ed o gi e a pleasan impression o he eyes.” I am no in en ing, I am no misrepresen ing, am I? I long o be re u ed. For why am I exer ing mysel excep o ge he ru h in e ery problem unra elled? n n
e.g. οὐκ ἔστιν ἡδέως ζῆν ἄνευ τοῦ φρονίμως καὶ καλῶς καὶ δικαίως. Diog. Laer . X. 140.




 n n
 
 Bu wai ! Epicurus also says ha pleasure does no increase when pain has been remo ed, and ha he highes pleasure is he absence o pain. Three big mis akes in a ew words. One n n
 n n
 n
 
 because he con radic s himsel . For jus now he said ha he had no e en an inkling o any good, unless he senses were in some sor ickled wi h pleasure; now, on he con rary, he says ha he highes pleasure is reedom rom pain. Is i possible o be more sel -con radic ory? The second mis ake is ha , as hese are hree na ural s a es, one o joy, he second o pain, he hird o nei her joy nor pain, he here hinks he irs and hird iden ical and makes no dis inc ion be ween pleasure and absence o pain. The hird mis ake he shares wi h cer ain philosophers,1 ha , hough ir ue is he objec o our eager seeking and philosophy has been de ised or he sake o securing i , Epicurus has se ered he highes good rom ir ue. n n

 “Yes, bu he o en praises ir ue.” He does, and so oo C. Gracchus, a er he had gran ed ex ra agan doles and poured ou he unds o he reasury like wa er, none he less, in his words, posed as he pro ec or o he reasury. Why am I o lis en o words, seeing ha I ha e he deeds be ore my eyes? The amous Piso, named Frugi, had spoken consis en ly agains he Corn-law.2 When he law was passed, in spi e o his consular rank, he was here o recei e he corn. Gracchus no iced Piso s anding in he hrong; he asked him in he hearing o he Roman people wha consis ency here was in coming or he corn under he erms o he law which he had opposed. “I shouldn' like i , Gracchus, o come in o your head o di ide up my proper y among all he ci izens; bu should you do so I should come or my share.” Did no he words o his serious and sagacious s a esman show wi h su icien clearness ha he public inheri ance was squandered by he Sempronian n n
The Lex Frumen aria o 123 B. C. by which cheap corn was dis ribu ed o ci izens was proposed by C. Sempronius Gracchus and hence called, as lower down, lex Sempronia. The anecdo e abou Piso ( or whom c . § 16) is in roduced o mark i s e il consequences.




 n n
 n n
 n n\nn
 
 
 law? Read Gracchus' speeches and you will say he was pro ec or o he reasury. n n
 n n
 
 Epicurus says a pleasurable li e is impossible unless accompanied by ir ue; he says ha or une has no power o er he wise man; he pre ers a plain o a rich die ; he says here is no season when he wise man is no happy: all hough s wor hy o a philosopher bu a ariance wi h pleasure. “He does no mean your idea o pleasure.” Le him mean any pleasure he pleases; surely he means pleasure o he kind ha has no share in ir ue. Come, i we do no unders and pleasure, do we unders and pain ei her? There ore I say ha i is no open o he man who measures he highes e il by he s andard o pain o in roduce he name o ir ue. n n
 n n
 
 And ye he Epicureans, excellen crea ures ha hey are ( or ne er was a se o beings less ar ul), complain ha I argue agains Epicurus like a par isan. Ah! hen, I suppose he con es be ween us is one or o ice or posi ion.1 To my hinking he highes good is in he soul, o Epicurus i is in he body; or me i is in ir ue, or him in pleasure. I is he Epicureans who igh , yes, and appeal o he loyal y o heir neighbours; and here are plen y o hem ready o lock in on he ins an :2 i is I who am he one o say ha I am no roubling, ha I shall look upon wha hey ha e se led as se led.3 n n

 There remains he Cyrenaic iew; hey hold ha dis ress arises where an e en has happened unexpec edly. This is indeed an impor an poin , as I ha e said be ore;1 I know ha i is he iew o Chrysippus oo ha wha has no been pre iously oreseen brings a more iolen shock: bu surprise is no e ery hing. Ye i is rue ha a sudden ad ance o he enemy causes a good deal more cons erna ion han an ad ance which is expec ed, and a sudden s orm a sea causes more in ense alarm han one ha is an icipa ed, and here are many ins ances o he kind. Bu on a care ul considera ion o he na ure o he unexpec ed you would ind no hing else, excep ha all sudden occurrences are magni ied, and ha or wo reasons: irs because no scope is gi en or weighing he magni ude o he occurrences; secondly because, where i seems ha pre ious precau ions could ha e been aken i su icien oresigh had been shown, he e il incurred, n n

Many Car haginians were sla es a Rome, many Macedonians a er he cap ure o King Perses.2 I ha e seen oo in he Peloponnese in my you h ul days some na i es o Corin h who were sla es.

 some years a er, i would no ha e been a remedy or wounds bu only or scars. For s ep by s ep, by slow degrees, pain is lessened as i goes on, no ha he ac ual condi ions are ordinarily changed or can be so, bu experience eaches he lesson which reason should ha e augh be ore, ha he hings once magni ied are smaller han hey seemed. n n
 n n
 
 Wha need is here, hen, someone will say, o argumen , or wha need a all o he com or we usually gi e when we wish o alle ia e he grie o mourners? For we ha e on he ip o our ongues as a rule he words “no hing should seem unexpec ed.” Bu how will he burden o loss be more endurable or he man who has recognized ha some hing o he kind mus happen o a human being? For his way o speaking akes no hing rom he ac ual sum o e il; all i does is o sugges ha no hing has aken place which should no ha e been expec ed. And ye such a mode o speaking is no wi hou e ec in impar ing com or ; I should ra her be inclined o hink i had ery grea e ec . There ore such hings as are unexpec ed do no ha e enough in luence o accoun or all dis ress ha arises; or he shock hey cause is perhaps hea ier, bu hey do no make he occurrences seem more serious; hey seem more serious because heir impression is s ill resh, no because o heir suddenness. n n
 n n
 
 The me hod here ore o disco ering he ru h is wo old, no merely in he case o hings ha seem e il, bu also o hings ha seem good. For we ei her inquire in o he charac er o he ac ual occurrence and i s magni ude, as or ins ance in dealing occasionally wi h po er y, he burden o which we ligh en in argumen by n n
 n n
 n
 
 poin ing ou how small and ew na ural needs are; or lea ing aside nice ies o argumen we gi e ins ances: now Socra es is quo ed, now Diogenes, now Caecilius'1 well-known line:

 E en undernea h he a ered man le o do h wisdom hide. n n
 
For, as he s ress o po er y is one and he same, wha reason can be gi en why C. Fabricius2 ound i endurable whils o hers say i is unbearable? n n

 n n
 
 Similar o his second me hod o com or ing is ha which eaches ha all ha has happened is na ural o human li e. For such a line o argumen no only includes a recogni ion o he ac s o man's condi ion, bu indica es ha wha he res o men ha e borne and are bearing is endurable.
In dealing wi h po er y many ins ances o pa ien endurance are quo ed: in dealing wi h scorn o o ice many are gi en o men who ha e no ob ained o ice and ha e been happier or ha ery reason, and praise is bes owed expressly upon he li e o men who ha e pre erred he re iremen o pri a e li e o a public career, and he well-known anapaes s o ha mos migh y king3 are no passed o er, in which he praises he old man and calls him blessed or being des ined o reach his la es day unhonoured and unknown.4 n n

 Similarly, oo, a en ion is called o hose who ha e los heir children, by gi ing ins ances, and so he sorrow o hose whose grie is excessi e is so ened by he examples n n
 n n
 n
 
 o o hers who ha e su ered in his way: he endurance o he o hers makes mishaps seem o ar less magni ude han he es ima e irs ormed o hem. So i is ha by re lec ion men gradually realize he ex reme alsi y o heir belie . Moreo er, he amous Telamon poin s he same moral in:

 I when I bega , . . .1 n n
 
and Theseus:

 Wi hin my hear I pondered ills o come,2 n n
 
and Anaxagoras: "I knew ha I had bego en a mor al."3 For all hese, by din o long re lec ion upon he lo o mankind, unders ood ha i mus by no means be regarded wi h he excessi e ear which i s in wi h popular belie . And o my mind he e ec upon wise men o pre ious considera ion is pre y much he same as he e ec o lapse o ime upon o hers; only i is a process o reasoning which res ores he ormer, while na ure le o hersel res ores he la er, when once he roo o he ma er is grasped, namely ha he e il which was grea es in an icipa ion is by no means grea enough o ruin a happy li e. n n

 n n
 
 All, here ore, we need conclude is ha he shock rom he unexpec ed is more se ere, no , as he Cyrenaics hink, ha , where wo men ha e me wi h equal mis or une, only he one on whom he mis or une has come unexpec edly is a ic im o dis ress. And so4 some, i is said, when sadness comes, ha e el a s ill deeper pang on being old o his common lo o mankind, namely ha i is he law o our en ry in o his world ha no one n n
Unexpec ed mis or une is no he only cause o dis ress, and so we ind men grie ing a he ine i able condi ions o human li e. When Solon was mourning he dea h o his son, someone said o him, “Tha will do no good;” and Solon replied, “I is or ha ery reason I weep, because I can do no good.”




 n n
 n
 
 can permanen ly escape e il. n n
 n n

 I was or his reason ha Carneades, as I see our riend An iochus1 s a es, habi ually censured Chrysippus or his appro al o he well-known passage in Euripides:

No mor al is here bu pain inds him ou n n
And sickness; many mus heir children bury, n n
And sow resh issue; dea h is end or all; n n
In ain do hese hings ex he race o men, n n
Ear h mus go back o ear h: hen li e by all n n
Like crops is har es ed. So mus i be. n n
 n n2
He said ha his way o speaking had no bearing a all on he alle ia ion o dis ress; or he argued ha he ac ual call o grie came rom he ac ha we were subjec o a necessi y so cruel. For Euripides' way o speaking was sui ed o bring com or o ill-disposed people rom he reci al o he e ils o o hers. My iew, howe er, is ar di eren . For he hough ha he lo o man mus be endured pre en s us rom con ending as i were agains God and also warns us ha we are human: and his re lec ion is a grea relie o sorrow, and he de ailed ins ances ci ed are no gi en o deligh he mind o he ill-na ured, bu o lead he mourner o hink ha he mus bear he burdens which he sees many men ha e borne in a spiri o quie res rain . n n
 n n

For we mus , as i were, shore up in e ery way hose who are oppling o er and unable o s and because o he ex en o heir dis ress. Hence, Chrysippus hinks ha dis ress ge s i s own name λύπη3 as being a dissolu ion o he whole man, and i can be en irely roo ed ou when we ha e n n

 disen angled i s cause, as I said a he ou se . For i is no hing else han he idea and con ic ion o an ins an and pressing grea e il. Consequen ly physical pain, he smar o which is exceedingly keen, is endured when we can see be ore us he promise o good, and a li e spen honourably and brillian ly a ords a solace so comple e ha ei her no ouch o dis ress approaches hose who ha e li ed such a li e, or else he prick o pain in he soul is only super icial. n n
 n n
 
 Bu when, in addi ion o he idea o serious e il, we en er ain also he idea ha i is an obliga ion, ha i is righ , ha i is a ma er o du y o be dis ressed a wha has happened,1 hen, and no be ore, he dis urbing e ec o deep dis ress ensues. n n
e.g. a he dea h o rela i es or riends.




 n n
 
 In consequence o his idea come he di eren odious orms o mourning, neglec o person, women's rending o he cheeks, bea ings o he breas and highs and head. Hence he amous Agamemnon o Homer and Accius oo,2
 
 O earing in his grie his unshorn hair, n n
 
which inspired he wi icism o Bion3 ha he ool o a monarch plucked ou his hair in his grie , or all he world as hough baldness were a relie o sadness. n n

 In he Aleïan plain he desola e wandered in sorrow, n n
 Ea ing his hear ou alone, and he oo s eps o men he a oided. n n
 
And Niobe2 is imagined in s one o represen , I suppose, e erlas ing silence in sorrow, while hey hink ha Hecuba on he o her hand, by reason o a sor o ierceness and ury o soul, was imagined o ha e been changed in o a bi ch.3 There are, moreo er, o her mourners who o en ind deligh in holding con erse wi h soli ude i sel , like he well-known nurse in Ennius:

 All hese hings hey do in he hour o grie , in he idea ha such hings are righ and proper and obliga ory, and he chie proo ha hey are done rom a sor o con ic ion o du y is shown by he ac ha , i any o hose who hink hey should be sorrow ul chance o beha e in a more human or cheer ul way, hey resume a gloomy demeanour and accuse hemsel es o misconduc because o his in errup ion o heir grie : indeed mo hers and eachers are e en accus omed o punish children, i in he mids o amily sorrow hey show any undue cheer ulness in ac or speech, and no merely wi h words bu e en wi h he whip hey n n
 n n

 orce hem o shed ears. Wha is he meaning o his? When ac ual cessa ion o sorrow has ensued and i is hus realized ha no hing is gained by mourning; do no he ac s o he case show ha i is en irely a ma er o will? n n
 n n
 
 Wha does he sel - ormen ing charac er—in Greek ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος —say in Terence?

 I ha e resol ed I do my boy less wrong n n
 So long as I mysel am miserable.1 n n
 
He resol es o be miserable. Can you hink anyone akes a resolu ion agains his will?

 Wor hy o any ill should I es eem mysel . n n
 
He es eems himsel “wor hy o ill” i he be no “miserable.” You see here ore ha e il comes rom belie , no rom na ure. Wha o hose whom he circums ances o he case pre en rom mourning? For ins ance in Homer he daily loss o numbers o li es produces an assuagemen o mourning; and so we ind he lines:

 Too many e ery day alling in dea h we see always, n n
 So ha no respi e here is or any rom sorrow o mourning; n n

 I was common alk ha hose who saw Cn.

There ore ear had he power o dri e away heir dis ress, and shall no reason ha e power o dri e i away rom he wise man? n n

 Wha , howe er, has more e ec in pu ing grie aside han he realiza ion o he ac ha i gains us no ad an age and ha indulgence in i is useless? I hen i can be se aside, i is also possible o re rain rom indulging in i . I mus here ore be admi ed ha dis ress is an indulgence due o an ac o will and o con ic ion. n n
 n n
 
 And ha is signi ied by he endurance o hose who submi more readily o any mishap a er hey ha e requen ly been hrough many experiences and who hink hey ha e a las succeeded in hardening hemsel es agains or une, like he charac er in Euripides:

 Were his sad day he irs ha dawned or me, n n

 Good cause had been o oss like new-yoked col n n
 Bu la ely brough o bear he ouch o bi ; n n

Since, hen, he exhaus ion brough by miseries renders dis resses milder, i mus be unders ood ha i is no he mis or une i sel ha is heir cause and origin. n n

 Do no philosophers o he highes eminence, who all he same ha e no ye a ained he s a e o "wisdom," unders and ha hey are in a pligh o u er e il?1 For hey are unwise, and here is no grea er e il han unwisdom; ye hey do no lamen . Why is his? Because o his kind o e il here is no adap ing he belie ha i is righ and regular and a ma er o du y o eel dis ressed a no being wise, whereas we do adap his belie o he kind o dis ress ha in ol es mourning, and such dis ress is he grea es o all. n n
According o he S oics hose who had no comple ely a ained wisdom were u erly wre ched and here was no di erence be ween heir li e and ha o he wors o mankind. For his and o her paradoxes Cicero laughs a hem, Pro Murena 61.

 And so Aris o le2 in upbraiding he philosophers o old or hinking, according o him, ha hanks o heir genius philosophy had reached per ec ion, says ha hey had been guil y o ex reme olly or boas ulness; all he same he adds ha he saw ha , as a consequence o he grea ad ance made in a ew years, philosophy would be absolu ely comple e.

 Wha else was i made hem ranquil excep he hough ha sorrow and mourning were unbe i ing in a man? There ore, where o hers are accus omed o surrender hemsel es o dis ress in he belie ha i is righ , hese men spurned dis ress in he hough ha i was degrading.

In opposi ion o his iew i is urged: Who is so mad as o mourn o his own ree choice? I is na ure ha causes grie , and your Cran or,2 hey say, hinks ha we mus gi e way o i . For i s a ack is pressed home and canno be resis ed. And so he hero Oileus in Sophocles,3 hough he had pre iously consoled Telamon or he dea h o Ajax, ye broke down when he heard o his own son's dea h. His change o mind is hus described:

 And here is none o wisdom so possessed, n n

The opponen s who say, “Who is so mad as o mourn o his own choice?” Bu hey admi ha in eeling dis ress men go ur her han na ure requires. “Well, are hey no hen as 'mad' as hose who mourn olun arily?” answers Cicero.

 Bu here are more reasons han one or alling a ic im o grie . Firs here is he belie already spoken o ha a hing is e il, and a he sigh o i and he con ic ion o i s presence dis ress ine i ably ollows. Secondly men also hink ha by he in ensi y o heir grie hey are gra i ying he dead. Add o hese a cer ain womanish supers i ion; or hey hink hey will more easily sa is y he immor al gods, i hey admi ha hey are crushed and pros ra ed by an o erwhelming blow. Bu he majori y do no see how inconsis en hese ideas are. For hey praise hose who, hey hink, mee dea h calmly; any who bear ano her's dea h wi h calmness hey consider deser ing o censure. As i i were in any sense possible, as is o en said in lo ers' alk, ha anyone should lo e ano her more han himsel . n n

 I is an excellen hing, and i you look in o i , a righ and jus hing oo o lo e hose, who should be our deares , as well as we do oursel es; bu o lo e hem more han oursel es is in no way possible. I is no o be desired in riendship ei her ha my riend should lo e me more han himsel , or I lo e him more han mysel ; i i could be so, i would resul in an upse o li e and all i s obliga ions. n n

 hey hemsel es would wish i hey were conscious, cer ainly ur her han our lo e or oursel es. n n

For bo h hose who ge no relie are wre ched by heir own in i a ion, and hose, who bear heir own mis or unes in a spiri di eren rom ha which hey ha e hemsel es ad oca ed in he case o o hers, are no worse han, as a rule, many a aricious men who censure he a aricious, or ambi ious men who censure he ambi ious; or i is a peculiari y o olly o discern he aul s o o hers and be orge ul o i s own. n n

 Bu beyond ques ion, since i is agreed ha dis ress is remo ed by long con inuance, he chie proo 3 is he ac ha i is no he mere lapse o ime ha produces his e ec , bu con inued re lec ion.

 I has, I hink, been su icien ly insis ed on ha dis ress is he idea o a presen e il wi h his implica ion in i , ha i is a du y o eel dis ress. An addi ion o his de ini ion is righ ly made by Zeno, namely ha his idea o a presen e il is a “ resh”1 one. This word, howe er, his ollowers in erpre o mean ha no only, according o heir iew, is ha “ resh” which has aken place a shor ime pre iously, bu ha so long as he imagined e il preser es a cer ain power o being igorous and re aining so o speak i s greenness,2 i is ermed “ resh.” For ins ance he amous Ar emisia, wi e o Mausolus, King o Caria, who buil he celebra ed burial monumen a Halicarnassus, li ed in sorrow all her days and was ed away under i s en eebling in luence. The idea o her sorrow was “ resh” or her e ery day, and his idea only ceases o be ermed “ resh” when i has wi hered away by leng h o ime. n n
The πάθη, per urba iones, emo ions, were according o he S oics olun ary, and judgmen s (κρίσεις) res ing on an idea or belie (δόξα). Time could weaken heir e ec , bu i hey re ained heir igour, hey coun ed as " resh" or newly concei ed.

And ye i seems o me Clean hes has no qui e seen ha he eeling o dis ress can some imes arise rom he ery hing which he himsel admi s o be he wors e il o all. For wha shall we say—seeing ha Socra es, as we are old, con inced Alcibiades ha he was in no rue sense a man and ha here was no di erence, or all his high posi ion, be ween him and any poor por er, whereupon Alcibiades was much dis ressed and implored Socra es wi h ears o each him ir ue and dri e baseness away,—wha shall we say, Clean hes? Surely no ha here was no e il in he cause which made Alcibiades eel dis ress?1 n n
This s ory is no in Pla o. I is gi en in Augus ine C.D. XIV. 8. Socra es showed Alcibiades ha he was wre ched because o his olly. Alcibiades was dis ressed because he was no wha he ough o ha e been, i.e. was base, which Clean hes says is he wors o all e ils. Clean hes can only say ha he "wise man "is ree rom e il and canno eel dis ress or sorrow: Lyco says ha dis ress is occasioned by ri les. Wha can ei her o hem do or Alcibiades? Is his dis ress real or no ? Is i or is i no due o "e il"? To S . Augus ine i is sorrow ( ris i ia), akin o he "godly sorrow "o 2 Cor. 7. 10, c . § 7.




 n n
 
 Wha o his? Wha is he meaning o Lyco's words?2 By way o minimizing dis ress he says ha i is occasioned by ri ling circums ances, discom or s o or une and o body, no by e ils o he soul. I ask you hen: he grie which Alcibiades el , did i no come rom e ils and laws in he soul? As or he com or Epicurus sugges s, enough has been pre iously said. n n

No need o wonder hen ha in he conduc o cases in cour we do no always ake up he same posi ion2 ( his is he erm we apply o lines o argumen in dispu es), bu we adap he line we ake o he occasion, o he charac er o he dispu e, o he personali y o he li igan ; we ac similarly in he alle ia ion o dis ress, or we ha e o consider wha me hod o rea men is admissible in each par icular case. n n

Ne er heless he course o our argumen has shown, i appears o me, ha hough he ac ual ques ion, whe her any hing was e il unless i could also be described as disgrace ul, was no speci ically pu a he ime—ne er heless, I say, we ha e come o see ha , wha e er e il here is in dis ress, i is no due o na ure, bu brough o a head by a judgmen o he will and by mis aken belie . n n

 These subjec s he Greeks di ide up under separa e heads o discourse, and deal wi h in separa e books; or hey are on he look-ou or subjec s o work a ; all he same he discussions are ull o charm.

Moreo er rom disorders are produced, in he irs place, diseases ( or which he erm is νοσήματα), and besides hese he a ec ions which are he opposi es o such diseases and which are accompanied by unwholesome a ersion and loa hing or cer ain hings; secondly here are produced sicknesses, ermed by he S oics ἀῤῥωστήματα, and hese oo ha e corresponding a ersions which are heir " opposi es."2 A his poin ar oo much a en ion is de o ed by he S oics, principally by Chrysippus, o drawing an analogy be ween diseases o he soul and diseases o he body.

Diseases and sicknesses o soul, like lo e o glory, come rom he disorders o lus and deligh : hey ha e " opposi es" in a ersions and disgus s which spring rom he disorder o ear, as or ins ance ha red o mankind, or lo e is he opposi e o ha e. In logical opposi ion black is he "con rary" o whi e and lo e o ha e. Bo h diseases and sicknesses ha e se erally corresponding a ersions which are "con rary" o hem and are heir "opposi es."

 n n
 
 XI. Whils here is heore ically a di erence be ween he ailmen s I am dealing wi h, in prac ice a any ra e hey are combined and heir origin is ound in lus and deligh . For when money is co e ed and reason is no a once applied as a kind o Socra ic remedy o cure he desire, he e il circula es in he eins and as ens on he i al organs, and disease and sickness ensue, hings which canno be plucked ou when hey are long es ablished; and or such a disease he name is a arice. And similarly he o her diseases like hirs or ame, like lo e o women, o gi e his erm o wha he Greeks call φιλογυνία, and all o her diseases and sicknesses origina e in similar ashion. I is hough moreo er ha ear is he origin o heir opposi es like ha red o women, as or ins ance in he Μισόγυνος o A ilius,1 like he ha red o all mankind el we are old by Timon2 who is ermed μισάνθρωπος, and like inhospi ali y: and all hese sicknesses o he soul origina e in a cer ain ear o he hings hey a oid and ha e. n n
 n n
 
 Fur hermore hey de ine sickness o soul as an in ense belie , persis en and deeply roo ed, which regards a hing ha is no desirable as hough i were eminen ly desirable. The produc o a ersion moreo er is de ined as an in ense belie , persis en and deeply roo ed, which regards a hing ha need no be shunned as hough i ough o be shunned: ur her his sor o belie is an ac o judging ha one has knowledge where one has none. There are moreo er cer ain subdi isions o sickness o he ollowing kind: a arice, ambi ion, lo e o n n

 XII. Now o come o he analogy o heal h and o make use a las o his comparison (bu more sparingly han is he way o he S oics), as some men are more prone o some diseases and o her men o o hers, and so we say o cer ain people ha hey are liable o ca ch cold, cer ain o hers o a acks o colic, no because hey are su ering a he momen bu because hey requen ly do so; in he same way some men are prone o ear, o hers o ano her disorder, in consequence o which in some cases we speak o an anxious emper and hence o anxious people, in o her cases o irascibili y which is di eren rom anger, and i is one hing o be irascible, ano her hing o be angry, jus as an anxious emper is di eren rom eeling anxie y; or no all men who are a imes anxious are o an anxious emper, nor are hose who ha e an anxious emper always eeling anxious, jus as or ins ance here is a di erence be ween in oxica ion and habi ual drunkenness, and i is one hing o be a gallan and ano her hing o be in lo e. Moreo er his proneness o some men o one disease and o hers o ano her is o wide applica ion; or i applies o all disorders. n n
 n n
 
 I is apparen also in a number o de ec s1; n n
 n n
For he di erence be ween i ia and per urba iones c . he beginning o § 30.




 n n
 n n\nI is apparen also in a number o de ec s1; bu or his here is no name. Men here ore are called bo h en ious and malicious (and jealous) and ear ul and compassiona e because o a proneness o such disorders, no because hey are always being hurried in o hem. This proneness hen o each indi idual o his own peculiar disorder would on he analogy o he body be called sickness, pro ided i be unders ood as proneness o sickness. Bu in he case o wha is good, because some men are be er adap ed o one sor o good and o hers o ano her, le i be named inclina ion; in he case o wha is e il le i be named proneness so as o sugges slipping; in he case o wha is nei her good nor bad le i ha e he earlier name. n n
 n n
 
 XIII. Now as he body is liable o disease, o sickness, o de ec , so is he soul. Disease is he erm applied o a break-down o he whole body, sickness o disease a ended by weakness, de ec when he par s o he body are no symme rical wi h one ano her and here ensue crookedness o he limbs, dis or ion, ugliness. And so he irs wo, disease and sickness, are a resul o shock and disorder o he bodily heal h as a whole; "de ec ,” howe er, is discernible o i sel , hough he general heal h is unimpaired. Bu in he soul we can only separa e disease rom sickness heore ically. De ec i eness,2 howe er, is a habi or a disposi ion which is hroughou li e inconsis en and ou o harmony wi h i sel . So i comes ha in he one per ersion o belie s he resul is disease and sickness, in he o her he resul is inconsis ency and discord. For no e ery de ec in ol es equal wan o harmony, as or ins ance he disposi ion o hose who are no ar o n n
 n n
For he di erence be ween i ia and per urba iones d . he beginning o § 30.




i.e. moral de ec i eness, in § 34 " iciousness," as he same rendering does no sui all con ex s.




 n n
 n n\nwisdom is indeed ou o harmony wi h i sel , as long as i is unwise, bu i is no dis or ed or per erse.1 Disease, howe er, and sickness are subdi isions o de ec i eness, bu i is a ques ion whe her disorders are subdi isions o he same class. n n
 n n
 
 For de ec s are permanen disposi ions, bu disorders are shi ing, so ha hey canno be subdi isions o permanen disposi ions. Moreo er as in e il he analogy o he body ex ends o he na ure o he soul, so i does in good. For he chie blessings o he body are beau y, s reng h, heal h, igour, agili y; so are hey o he soul. For as in he body he adjus men o he arious par s, o which we are made up, in heir i ing rela ion o one ano her is heal h, so heal h o he soul means a condi ion when i s judgmen s and belie s are in harmony, and such heal h o soul is ir ue, which some say is emperance alone,2 o hers a condi ion obedien o he dic a es o emperance and ollowing close upon i and wi hou speci ic di erence, bu whe her i be he one or he o her, i exis s, hey say, in he wise man only. There is ur hermore a cer ain kind o heal h o he soul which he unwise oo can enjoy, when agi a ion o mind is remo ed by medical rea men . n n
 n n
 
 And as in he body a cer ain symme rical shape o he limbs combined n n
 n n
The meaning o his passage is di icul o ollow. Cicero seems o be dis inguishing be ween wo s a es o moral de ec , he one a "habi ," he o her a "disposi ion." Bo h are due o per ersion o belie , bu icious "habi " means depra i y, icious " disposi ion means only inconsis ency, some imes more, some imes less. A " disposi ion" by long indulgence can become a "habi ." When Dr. Johnson was urged by Hannah More o ake a li le wine, "I can' ake a li le, child," he answered; " here ore I ne er ouch i ," or he did no in end he "disposi ion " o become a "habi ." On he o her hand Johnson declared himsel " a hardened and shameless ea drinker," or "disposi ion" had been allowed o become "habi ." Horace recognizes he dis inc ion be ween he man who has he habi o ice and who rejoices in iniqui y, and he man who has he "disposi ion o ice bu is a war wi h himsel , Sa .

 n n\nwi h a cer ain charm o colouring is described as beau y; so in he soul he name o beau y is gi en o an equipoise and consis ency o belie s and judgmen s, combined wi h a cer ain s eadiness and s abili y, ollowing upon ir ue or comprising he rue essence o ir ue. And so s reng h o soul resembling he s reng h and sinews and e ec i eness o he body is also described by similar erms.

There is his dissimilari y be ween soul and body, ha he s rong soul canno be a acked by disease as bodies can, bu physical a ersions can occur wi hou blame,1 while i is no so wi h a ersions o he soul in which all diseases and disorders are he resul o con emp o reason. Consequen ly hey are only ound in human beings; or while animals ac in a way ha is comparable, ye hey are no a acked by disorders o he soul. There is, howe er, his di erence be ween quick-wi ed and dull-wi ed men, ha gi ed men resemble Corin hian bronze which is slow o be a acked by rus , and similarly hey are bo h slower o be a acked by disease and quicker in reco ery, while wi h he dull-wi ed i is no so. Nor is he soul o he gi ed man by any means liable o e ery disease and disorder, or i is no so o any hing sa age and mons rous; and some o i s disorders such as compassion, dis ress, ear, bear a n n

And now ha our argumen has worked i s way, as i were, clear o hese rocks wi h all heir ca chy poin s,1 le us pursue he course o he discussion ha remains, pro ided only I ha e gi en an accoun which is adequa ely clear, considering he di icul y o he subjec .

There ore he man, whoe er he is, whose soul is ranquillized by res rain and consis ency and who is a peace wi h himsel , so ha he nei her pines away in dis ress, nor is broken down by ear, nor consumed wi h a hirs o longing in pursui o some ambi ion, nor maudlin in he exuberance o meaningless eagerness-he is he wise man o whom we are in ques , he is he happy man who can hink no human occurrence insuppor able o he poin o dispiri ing him, or unduly deligh ul o he poin o rousing him o ecs asy.

 n n\nspan o our brie li e can seem o momen o he wise man whose soul is e er on he wa ch o pre en he occurrence o any hing un oreseen, any hing unexpec ed, any hing wha e er ha is s range? n n
 n n
 
 Fur her he also direc s so searching a glance in all direc ions wi h he cons an aim o inding an assured re rea or a li e ree rom exa ion and worry, ha , wha e er re erse or une may in lic , he shoulders his burden ranquilly; and he who shall do his will no only be ree rom dis ress bu rom all o her disorders as well. Bu when he soul is reed rom such ailmen s, i renders men comple ely and en irely happy, while he man who is agi a ed and aliena ed rom sure and per ec reason, also loses no only equabili y bu heal h o mind as well. : n n
 And here ore he iews and u erances o he Peripa e ics mus be regarded as weak and e emina e, when hey say ha souls are necessarily subjec o disorders, bu ix a cer ain limi beyond which disorders should no pass. n n
 n n
 
 Do you I ask prescribe a limi or ice? Or is here no ice in re using o obey reason? or is reason so backward in eaching, ei her ha he hing one ei her passiona ely desires or eels ex ra agan ranspor s a securing is no good? or ur her, ha he burden, benea h he pressure o which one ei her lies pros ra e or he pressure o which one scarcely has he resolu ion o resis , is no e il? and ha all ins ances ei her o excessi e sadness or excessi e deligh are due o decep ion? And i his decep ion should in he case o ools ha e i s impression weakened by lapse o ime (wi h he resul ha , hough he same process o decep ion con inually goes on, hey bear wha is o long s anding in one way, wha is o n n
 n n
 n n
 n n\nrecen occurrence in ano her), ye wise men would no be so much as ouched by i a all. n n
 n n
 
 For1 wha , I ask, will he sugges ed "limi " be? Le us inquire or ins ance in o he limi o dis ress o which hey de o e mos a en ion. I has been recorded in Fannius2 ha P. Rupilius was dis ressed a his bro her's ailure o be elec ed o he consulship. Bu all he same he seems o ha e passed he limi , since he died o chagrin. He ough here ore o ha e shown more res rain . Well, suppose ha , hough he showed modera ion under his blow, here had come in addi ion he loss o children? a new dis ress would ha e arisen: gran i a modera e one: s ill an addi ion o consequence would ha e been made. Well, suppose ha subsequen ly se ere bodily pains, suppose loss o proper y, suppose blindness, suppose exile had ollowed. I here were an addi ion o dis ress o ma ch each separa e e il, here would be a sum o al impossible o bear. n n
 n n
 
 XVIII. He here ore who looks or a "limi " o ice is doing much he same as i he were o hink ha a man who has lung himsel headlong rom Leucas3 can s op his all when he will. For jus as ha is impossible, so i is impossible or a disordered and exci ed soul o con rol i sel or s op where i wishes; and, speaking generally, hings which are ruinous in heir de elopmen are icious also in heir origin. n n
 n n
 
 Moreo er dis ress and all o her orms o disorder, when in ensi ied, are assuredly deadly; here ore, also, when experienced, heir endency is rom he ou se o a grea ex en deadly. For hey are orced on by heir na ure, when once he se erance rom reason has begun, and weakness is by i s na ure sel -indulgen and is carried ou o sea wi h- n n

This is he language hey use. In he irs place hey praise irascibili y1 a grea leng h; hey name i he whe s one o bra ery and say ha he assaul s o angry men upon an enemy or disloyal ci izen show grea er ehemence; bu ha here is no subs ance in he pe y logic o hose who coldly argue like his: "I is righ o igh his ba le; i is proper o con end or laws, or liber y, or coun ry;" ha hese words ha e no meaning unless bra ery breaks ou in a blaze o anger. And hey do no argue abou warriors only; no s ern commands in ime o need are gi en, hey hink, wi hou some hing o he keen edge o irascibili y. Finally hey do no appro e o an ora or unless he uses he prickles o irascibili y, no merely in bringing an accusa ion bu e en in conduc ing a de ence, and hough he anger be no genuine, ye i should, hey hink, be eigned in language and ges ure, ha he deli ery o he ora or may kindle he anger o he hearer. In ine hey say ha hey do no regard anyone, who does no know how o be angry, n n

 And indeed hey do no only praise lus o his sor ( or anger is as I de ined i la ely3 he lus o engeance), bu hey say ha his sel same kind o emo ion, call i lus or desire,4 has been bes owed by na ure or purposes o he highes u ili y; or no one is able o do any hing really well excep he has a lus or i . Themis ocles walked by nigh in a public place because he was, he said, unable o sleep, and in answer o ques ions replied ha he was kep awake by he rophies o Mil iades. Who has no heard o he sleeplessness o Demos henes? who said ha he was grie ed i e er he had been bea en by he diligence o workmen rising be ore he break o day. Las ly he leaders o philosophy i sel would ne er ha e been able o make such prodigious ad ance in heir s udies wi hou a iery longing.

Cicero wishes o show ha he ollowers o he Academy, o whom he was one, do no endea our o suppor a preconcei ed opinion or o engage in he war o sec s, bu o ind ou he iew which is neares o he ru h.




 n n

Fur her han his he mind o man canno ad ance. There is he de ini ion o disorder which I hink Zeno righ ly employed; or his de ini ion1 is ha "disorder is an agi a ion o he soul alien rom reason, con rary o na ure," or more brie ly ha "disorder is a longing o undue iolence," unduly iolen howe er being unders ood o mean a longing which is ar remo ed rom he equabili y o na ure.

 Besides, he words o he S oics are in he main hose o men arguing wi h wisdom and insigh : he o hers deal in rhe orical ireworks,2 "kindlings o souls and whe s ones o ir ues." Or is i he ac ha a bra e man canno be bra e unless he begins o lose his emper? True or gladia ors-yes; and ye in hese sel same men we o en see an equable spiri : Con erse hold hey, mee oge her, ques ions ask and make reques s,3 so ha hey seem o be cool ra her han angry. Bu suppose, i you like, here be in his class o men some Pacideianus o he spiri described by Lucilius:4 Kill him or my par I shall and shall conquer, he says, i you ask his.

 O A ricanus5 indeed, o whom we ha e be er knowledge, because his memory is resh in our minds, I can e en ake my oa h ha he was no in a blaze o irascibili y when on he ield o ba le he co ered M. Allienus Pelignus wi h his shield and plan ed his sword in he breas o his enemy. I n n

 Why hen do you bring in anger here? Is i ha bra ery has no impulses o i s own unless i begins o lose i s wi s? Again, do you hink ha Hercules, who was raised o hea en by ha sel same bra ery you would ha e o be irascibili y, was angry when he s ruggled wi h he boar o Eryman hus or he lion o Nemea? or Theseus oo when he gripped he horns o he bull o Mara hon?

When such principles ha e been es ablished by judgmen and hough , hen appears he s rong and s eady bra ery we are looking or, unless, i may be, our no ion is ha ac s done in an impe uous, iery and high-spiri ed way are done in a mood o irascibili y. To my mind e en ha Scipio,2 he chie pon i , who eri ied he ru h o he S oic maxim ha he wise man is ne er ou o o ice, does no seem o ha e been angry wi h Tiberius Gracchus when he le he spiri less consul and, hough himsel holding no o icial posi ion, called, as hough he were consul, upon all who desired he sa e y o he commonweal h o ollow him. I canno say whe her I mysel ha e ac ed bra ely in public li e: i e er I ha e so ac ed, assuredly I ha e no ac ed in anger. Or is here any hing more like unsoundness o mind han anger? n n

E ery now and again here are hin s o wha was expec ed o Marcus Bru us in regard o Caesar, c . § 2.

 Wha share ha e change o colour, oice, eyes, brea hing, ungo ernableness o speech and ac in soundness o mind? Wha more degraded han Homer's Achilles, han his Agamemnon in heir brawl?1 Ajax2 I need no quo e, or him a any ra e anger led on o madness and dea h. Bra ery hen does no need he backing o irascibili y. I is o i sel su icien ly equipped, prepared and armed. Su icien ly I say, or here is, no doub , a sense in which we may call drunkenness o use o bra ery, aberra ion o mind oo o use, because he madman and he drunkard o en do many hings wi h uncommon impe uosi y. Ajax is always bra e bu bra es in renzy; or Glorious was he deed he wrough when Danaan ranks were alling back; The common sa e y he secured: in ury he he ray renewed.3 n n

 XXIV. Are we here ore o say ha unsoundness o mind is use ul? Examine he de ini ions o bra ery; you will realize ha i s ands in no need o loss o emper. Bra ery hen is a disposi ion o he soul obedien o he highes law in enduring icissi udes; or he main enance o a s eady judgmen in mee ing and repulsing icissi udes which seem dread ul; or he knowledge o icissi udes which are dread ul and he opposi e o dread ul or wholly o be ignored, main aining a s eady judgmen o such icissi udes, or more brie ly as Chrysippus n n

Tha his is ir ue's work I should show, had no he pre ious day's discussions made i ully plain. n n
 n n
 
 Fur her, since dis urbances o he soul produce wre chedness, while ranquilli y produces happy li e; and as he course o dis urbance is wo old, because dis ress and ear res on e ils ha are expec ed, whils ex ra agan joy and lus res on a mis aken no ion o wha is good, and all hese hings con lic wi h delibera ion and reason-will you hesi a e o gi e he name o happy o he man whom you ind undis urbed by, libera ed and ree rom agi a ions so oppressi e and so mu ually discordan and es ranged rom one ano her? And ye his is always he condi ion o he wise man : he wise man here ore is always happy. Fur hermore oo e ery good hing is joy ul; now wha is joy ul deser es credi and es eem; moreo er wha can be so described is also glorious; now i glorious i is assuredly praisewor hy; moreo er wha is praisewor hy is surely also righ ; wha is good here ore is righ .1 n n
The conclusion predica es he las predica e righ o he irs subjec good, c . III. § 15.

 Bu wha our opponen s coun as good hings hey do no e en hemsel es pronounce righ ; here ore he only good is wha is righ : and rom his i ollows ha happy li e is bound up wi h rec i ude alone. n n
 n
 Those hings here ore he abundan possession o which does no pre en ex reme wre chedness canno be named or considered good. n n

 Ha e you any doub ha excellen heal h, s reng h, beau y, senses keen and igorous in he ex reme; add i you like oo suppleness and quickness o mo emen ; bes ow weal h, dis inc ions, commands, resources, glory;-i he man who possesses hese hings is unjus , in empera e, ear ul, wi h an in elligence sluggish or e en non-exis en , will you hesi a e o pronounce him wre ched?

Le us be care ul les i be no rue ha jus as a heap o any hing is made up o grains o i s own kind,1 so happy li e is bound o be made up o par s ha are like i sel .

For all ha is o he na ure o good is desirable; moreo er wha is desirable is cer ainly o be appro ed; bu wha one has appro ed mus be regarded as welcome and agreeable: here ore also i mus be held wor hy o dis inc ion. And i his is so i mus o necessi y be praisewor hy. And rom his i ollows ha wha is righ is he only good.2 n n
e.g. whea , barley, oa s.




Chain-argumen again as in § 43.




 n n
 
 And unless we desire o hold as his conclusion here are a number o hings we shall eel bound o pronounce good; I pass o er riches which I do no include in he ca egory o good, as anyone howe er unwor hy can possess hem; or i is 
 n no anyone you will who can possess wha is good: I pass o er good bir h and public repu a ion where i is called in o being by he uni ed oice o ools and kna es: bu ake such insigni ican hings-we ha e o call hem good-as whi e ee h, ine eyes, resh colour and he hings ha An iclea1 praises in washing he ee o Ulysses, n n

 "Bu s ay! or he S oics gi e he name o ad an ages or pre erences2 o he same hings ha he Peripa e ics name good." I is rue hey do, bu hey do no say ha happy li e is hereby ul illed; he Peripa e ics on he con rary hink ha wi hou hese hings no li e can be happy, or supposing i be happy, i cer ainly canno be supremely happy. Now we wish i o be supremely happy and our iew is con irmed by Socra es' well-known conclusion. For his was he way in which ha leader o philosophy argued, ha as was he disposi ion o each indi idual soul so was he man; and as was he man in himsel so was his speech; moreo er deeds resembled speech and li e resembled deeds. Fur her he disposi ion o he soul in a good man is praisewor hy, and here ore he li e o a good man is praisewor hy, and or ha reason righ , seeing ha i is praisewor hy. And rom hese argumen s he conclusion comes ha he li e o good men is happy. n n
An iclea was he mo her o Ulysses. His nurse was Euryclea. The erse comes rom he play o Pacu ius, quo ed in II. § 49.

 And righ ly so, or—in he name o gods and men !—
 nhas no su icien been learn rom our pre ious discussions; or is i or he sake o amusemen and passing he ime ha we ha e said ha he wise man is always ree rom all agi a ion o soul o which I gi e he name o dis urbance? ha in his soul here reigns he mos ranquil calm? The man hen who is empera e, s ead as , wi hou ear, wi hou dis ress, wi hou any eagerness, wi hou lus , is he no happy? Bu such is he charac er o he wise man always: here ore he wise man is always happy. Again, how can he good man ail o re er all his ac s and eelings o he s andard he holds o be praisewor hy?
 
 Bu he re ers e ery hing o he s andard o li ing happily;1 here ore happy li e is praisewor hy; and wi hou ir ue no hing is praisewor hy; happy li e here ore is consumma ed by ir ue. n n

 And his conclusion is pro ed again in he ollowing way: nei her in a wre ched li e nor in such a li e as is nei her wre ched nor happy is here any hing commendable or wor hy o glory; and ye in he li es o some men here is some hing commendable, illus rious and exemplary, as in he li e o Epaminondas : n n

 So hen, i happy li e is a reali y, i is wor hy o 
 n glory and commendable and exemplary; or here is no hing else o be commendable and exemplary. And when his is es ablished you realize wha is he conclusion, and in any case, unless he li e which is a he same ime righ is happy, here mus o necessi y be some hing else be er han happy li e. For surely hey will admi ha wha is ound o be righ is be er: consequen ly here will be some hing be er han happy li e, and can any s a emen more wrong-headed han his be made? Tell me! when hey admi ha ice has su icien power o make li e wre ched, mus hey no admi ha ir ue has he same power o make li e happy? For rom hings ha are opposed consequences ha are opposi es ollow logically. n n
 n n
 
 And a his poin I ask or he meaning o he amous balance o Cri olaus,1 who claims ha i in one scale he pu s he good ha belongs o he soul, and in he o her he good ha belongs o he body and good hings which come rom ou side he man, he irs scale sinks so ar as o ou weigh he second wi h land and seas hrown in as well. n n
 Wha hen pre en s ei her his hinker or he amous Xenocra es2 as well, ha mos in luen ial o philosophers, who exal s ir ue so earnes ly and deprecia es and rejec s e ery hing else, rom making no merely happy li e depend upon ir ue bu supremely happy li e as well? And, in ac , i his is no done, he annihila ion o he ir ues will be he consequence. n n

 For he man who is suscep ible o dis ress mus necessarily be also suscep ible o ear; or ear is he anxious an icipa ion o coming dis ress; moreo er he man who is suscep ible o ear is also suscep ible o righ , imidi y, error, cowardice;3

 Again, i ir ue gi es su icien aid or leading a good li e, i also gi es su icien or a happy one. For surely ir ue gi es su icien o make us li e bra ely; i bra ely, su icien oo o make us high-souled and in ac ne er appalled by any e en and always unde ea ed.

 happy li e comes rom unceasing ulness o joys, i ollows ha i comes rom rec i ude.1 n n
 n n
 
 Bu ha we may no ry by he use o argumen alone o reach he ru h we wish o re eal, we mus se be ore our eyes cer ain as i were palpable inducemen s o make us urn more readily o he knowledge and unders anding o i s meaning. Le us assume a man pre-eminen ly endowed wi h he highes quali ies and le our imagina ion play or a momen wi h he pic ure. In he irs place he mus be o ou s anding in elligence; or ir ue is no easily ound o go wi h sluggish minds; secondly he mus ha e an eager en husiasm in he ques o ru h; and rom his springs he amous hree old progeny o he soul:2 one cen red in he knowledge o he uni erse and he disen anglemen o he secre s o na ure; he second in dis inguishing he hings ha should be sough ou or a oided and in raming a rule o li e; he hird in judging wha is he consequence o e ery premise, wha is incompa ible wi h i , and in his lies all re inemen o argumen and ru h o judgmen . n n
 n n
 
 Wi h wha joy, pray, mus hen he soul o he wise man be hrilled when in such company he spends his li e and passes his nigh s in heir s udy! When or ins ance3 he disco ers he mo emen s and re olu ions o he whole hea en4 and sees he coun less s ars ixed in he sky in unison wi h he mo emen o he aul i sel as hey keep heir appoin ed place, se en o hers preser ing heir se eral courses, n hough ar remo e rom one ano her in he heigh or lowliness o heir posi ion, and ye heir wandering mo emen s mark he se led and regula ed spaces o heir course-no wonder he spec acle o all his s imula ed hose men o old and encouraged hem o ur her search.1 n n
 n n
 
 Hence sprang he in es iga ion in o he beginnings and as i were he seeds rom which all hings go heir origin, propaga ion and grow h, o ind ou wha was he beginning o each kind whe her inanima e or anima e, or mu e or speaking, wha li e is, wha dea h, and wha he change and ransmu a ion rom one hing in o ano her, wha he origin o he ear h, wha weigh s preser e i s equilibrium,2 wha are he ca erns in which he seas are upheld,3 wha orce o gra i y makes all hings end o he world's cen re which is also lowes in wha is spherical.4 n n
 To he soul occupied nigh and day in hese medi a ions here comes he knowledge enjoined by he god a Delphi,5 ha he mind should know i s own sel and eel i s union wi h he di ine mind, he source o he ulness o joy unquenchable. For medi a ion upon he power and na ure o he gods o i sel kindles he desire o a aining an immor ali y ha resembles heirs, nor does he soul hink ha i is limi ed o his shor span o li e, when i sees ha he causes o hings are linked one o ano her in an ine i able chain, and ne er heless heir succession rom e erni y o e erni y is go erned n by reason and in elligence. n n
 n n
 
 As he wise man gazes upon his spec acle and looks upward or ra her looks round upon all he par s and regions o he uni erse, wi h wha calmness o soul he urns again o re lec upon wha is in man and ouches him more nearly! Hence comes his knowledge o ir ue;1 he kinds and species o he ir ues break in o blossom, disco ery is made o wha na ure regards as he end in wha is good and he las ex remi y in wha is e il,2 he objec o our du ies and he rule or he conduc o li e ha mus be chosen. n n
 n n
 
 And by he explora ion o hese and similar problems he chie conclusion o all a ained is he aim o his discussion o ours, ha ir ue is sel -su icien or leading a happy li e. In he hird place ollows ha which spreads reely o er all par s o he ield o wisdom, which gi es he de ini ion o a hing, dis inguishes kinds, links up sequences, draws jus conclusions, discerns rue and alse,— he ar and science o reasoning;3 and his, besides i s supreme use ulness in weighing judgmen s, a ords par icularly a noble deligh which is wor hy o wisdom. Bu his is he occupa ion o leisure le he wise man we ha e imagined also pass o he main enance o he public weal.4 Wha course more excellen could he ake, since his prudence shows him he rue ad an age o his ellow ci izens, his jus ice le s him di er no hing o heirs o his own amily, and he is s rong in he exercise o so many di eren remaining ir ues? Add o his he rui which springs rom riendships5 in which learned men ind he counsel which shares heir hough s and almos brea hes he same brea h hroughou he course o li e, as well as he supreme charm o daily social in ercourse. Wha , pray, does n such a li e require o make i happier? n n
 n n
 
 And o a li e illed wi h joys so abundan and in ense, or une i sel is bound o yield i s place. I hen i is happiness o rejoice in such goods o he soul, and all wise men ha e ull experience o such joys, we are bound o admi ha hey are all happy. n n
 A. E en in or ure and upon he rack? M. Do you hink I mean on beds o iole s and roses? Or is Epicurus, who merely pu s on he mask o a philosopher and has bes owed he i le on himsel , o be allowed o say (and say i indeed he does, really and ruly, wi h my pronounced appro al, spi e o his inconsis ency) ha here is no ime when he wise man, e en i burn , racked, cu in pieces, canno cry ou : "I coun i all as no hing," par icularly as Epicurus res ric s e il o pain and good o pleasure, makes a mock o his "righ and base" o ours and says we are busied wi h words and u ering sounds emp y o meaning, and ha no hing in eres s us excep he bodily sensa ion o ei her rough or smoo h. Shall we allow his man, whose judgmen di ers bu li le rom he ins inc o he beas s, o be orge ul o himsel and be disdain ul o or une a he momen when all ha he holds good and e il is a or une's disposal; o say ha he is happy in he ex remi y o or ure and upon he rack a he momen when he has laid down ha no only is pain he wors o e ils bu is he only one as well? n n
 n n
 
 And he has in no way pro ided or himsel hose healing aids o he endurance o pain o be ound in s reng h o soul, shame o baseness, he habi ual prac ice o pa ience, he lessons o or i ude, a manly hardness, bu says ha he inds peace in he recollec ion o pas npleasures and in ha alone, jus as i a man swel ering in uneasy endurance o iolen summer hea should choose o recollec a dip in he cool reshness o he s reams1 in my Arpinum; n n
 n n
 
 or I do no see how pas pleasures can allay presen e ils. Bu as his man, who would ha e no righ o say i i he chose o be sel -consis en , says ha he wise man is always happy, wha ough o be expec ed o hose who consider no hing desirable, no hing wor h reckoning as a good where rec i ude is no ound? n n
 For my par , I should say, le he Peripa e ics also and he Old Academy make an end some ime or o her o heir s u ering and ha e he courage o say openly and loudly ha happy li e will s ep down in o he bull o Phalaris.2 n n
 n n
 
 For gran ha here are hree kinds o good hings ( o make a inal escape rom he meshes o S oic sub le ies o which I realize I ha e made more use han I generally do), gran i you will he exis ence o hese kinds o good, pro ided only ha goods o he body and ex ernal goods lie gro elling on he ground and are merely ermed good because hey are o be "pre erred,"3 whils hose o her di ine goods4 ex end heir in luence ar and wide and reach o he hea ens: why should I pronounce anyone who has secured hem o be happy only, and no supremely happy as well? n n
 Bu will he wise man be erribly a raid o pain ?5 For pain is he chie obs acle o our iew : or agains dea h, our own and ha o our rela i es, and agains dis ress and all o her disorders o he soul we ha e,
 
 n 
 I hink, been su icien ly armed and pro ided by he pre ious days' discussions: pain seems o be he mos ac i e an agonis o ir ue; i poin s i s iery dar s, i hrea ens o undermine or i ude, grea ness o soul and pa ience. n n
 n n
 
 Will ir ue hen ha e o gi e way o pain, will he happy li e o he wise and s ead as man yield o i ? Wha degrada ion, grea gods o hea en! Spar an boys1 u er no cry when heir bodies are mangled wi h pain ul blows; I ha e seen wi h my own eyes roops o youngs ers in Lacedaemon igh ing wi h inconcei able obs inacy, using is s and ee and nails and e en ee h o he poin o losing heir li es ra her han admi de ea . Wha barbarous coun ry more rude and wild han India?

 n n
 
 whils he women in India, when he husband o any o hem dies, compe e wi h one ano her o decide whom he husband lo ed bes ( or each man usually has more han one wi e): and she who is ic orious, accompanied by her rela i es, goes joy ully o join her husband on he uneral pyre; he conquered ri al sadly qui s he ield.

c . § 13.




This is precisely wha he has o pro e.




 n
 
 
 For i is charac eris ic o he wise man o do no hing o which he can repen , no hing agains his will, o do e ery hing nobly, consis en ly, soberly, righ ly, no o look orward o any hing as i i were bound o come, o be as onished a no occurrence under he impression ha i s occurrence is unexpec ed and s range, o bring all hings o he s andard o his own judgmen , o abide by his own decisions. And wha can be happier han his I cer ainly canno concei e. n n
 n n
 
 For he S oics indeed he conclusion is easy, since hey hold i he so ereign good o li e according o na ure and in harmony wi h na ure, seeing ha no only is his he wise man's se led du y bu also i lies in his power, and so or hem i ollows necessarily ha where a man has he chie good in his power, he also has he power o happy li e: hus he li e o he wise is rendered happy always. Now you know he u erances I hink he mos courageous abou happy li e and, a he poin we now are unless you ha e some hing be er o sugges — he rues as well. n n
 A. I ha e no be er sugges ion o o er or my par , bu here is a a our I should like o ob ain rom you, i i is no roublesome (seeing ha you are no hampered by being ied o any de ini e school o hough , and as e rom all o hem e ery hing ha s rikes you mos as ha ing he semblance o ru h),1 as a li le while back you appeared o be urging he Peripa e ics and he Old Academy o ha e he courage o say reely wi hou reser a ion ha wise men were always supremely happy, his is wha I should like o hear, how you hink i is consis en or hem o say so; n or you ha e said a good deal in opposi ion o he opinion hey hold1 by adop ing he conclusions o he S oic reasoning. M. Le me hen use he reedom allowed o my school o philosophic hough alone, which decides no hing on i s own pronouncemen bu ranges o er he whole ield,2 in order ha he ques ion may be decided by o hers on i s own meri s, wi hou in oking anyone's au hori y. And since i appears ha wha you wish es ablished is ha , wha e er he iews held by warring sec s abou he limi s3 o good and e il, ne er heless ir ue is su icien securi y or a happy li e, a proposi ion which Carneades we are old habi ually discussed4-bu he did so hea edly, as was his way in opposing he S oics whom he was always mos eager o re u e, and agains whose eaching his emper had ired up- or my par I shall rea he ques ion calmly. For i he S oics ha e righ ly ixed he limi s o he good, he ques ion is se led: i ollows o necessi y ha he wise man is always happy. n n
 n n
 
 Bu le us inquire, i possible, in o each single opinion o he remaining schools o hough , ha so his noble dogma, as i were, o happy li e, can i in wi h he iews and eaching o hem all.5 n n
 Now hese in my opinion are he iews abou "limi s" s ill main ained and suppor ed. Firs our simple ones: ha no hing is good unless i is morally righ , as he S oics say; no good excep pleasure, as Epicurus; no good excep absence o pain, as Hieronymus ; no good excep enjoymen o he irs goods o na ure, ei her all or he chie o hem, as Carneades argued agains he S oics. n n

 pain, as Hieronymus ;1 no good excep enjoymen o he irs goods o na ure,2 ei her all or he chie o hem, as Carneades argued agains he S oics. n n
 n n
 
 These hen are he simple; he nex are composi e : hree kinds o good, he highes o he soul, second o he body, hird rom he ou side, as he Peripa e ics,3 and he Old Academy are much he same ; Dinomachus and Callipho4 ha e coupled pleasure wi h rec i ude; he Peripa e ic Diodorus5 has joined, howe er, reedom rom pain o rec i ude. n n
 n n
 
 These are he iews which ha e some solid suppor ; or hose o Aris o, Pyrrho, Herillus6 and some o hers ha e mel ed in o air. Le us see wha hese can do or us, lea ing on one side he S oics whose iew I hink I ha e suppor ed su icien ly already. And besides hem he Peripa e ic case is cleared up: apar rom Theophras us7 and any who ollow him in a eeble dread and abhorrence o pain, i is allowable or he res o hem a any ra e o do as hey usually do, ha is o say, exal he digni y and grandeur o ir ue. And when hey ha e raised i o he hea ens, in he way habi ual o men who ha e a ine low o eloquence, i is easy o rample all else under oo and despise i in comparison wi h ir ue; or i is no allowable or men who say ha renown mus be sough a he cos o pain o deny ha hose who had a ained heir aim are happy; or hough hey are in ol ed in cer ain e ils, ye his erm o happiness has a wide and ar-reaching meaning. n n
 For as commerce is ermed pro i able and n arming produc i e, no i he one always escapes all loss, he o her always escapes all damage rom bad wea her, bu i in he main here is in each a good margin o prosperi y; so li e can be ermed happy, no only i i is brim ul o good hings o e ery sor , bu i in he main and on he weigh ier side here is a marked preponderance o good. n n
 n n
 
 There ore by he reasoning o hese philosophers1 happy li e will ollow ir ue e en o or ure and in i s company pass down in o he bull,2 on he au hori y o Aris o le, Xenocra es, Speusippus, Polemo,3 and hrea s and bribes will no per er i o abandon ir ue. The opinion o Callipho and Diodorus will be he same, bo h o whom so warmly espouse rec i ude ha all hings ha ha e no go i mus , hey hold, be ranked a long way behind i . The res do seem o be in somewha o a s rai , s ill hey manage o swim heir way ou -Epicurus, Hieronymus, and any who are ound o care o suppor poor deser ed Carneades. For here is none o hem who does no regard he soul as judge o he rue good and join in ins ruc ing i o be able o despise such hings as ha e only he semblance o good or e il. n n
 n n
 
 For wha you hold o be he case o Epicurus, will also be he case o Hieronymus and Carneades and, upon my word, o all he res o hem; or who o hem is insu icien ly pro ided agains dea h or pain? Le us begin, i you will, wi h he man we name e emina e,4 name a olup uary. Well, do you hink him a raid o dea h or pain? He calls he day o his dea h happy and in he su erings o acu e pains he represses hose ery pains by he li ing remembrance o his disco eries. n n

 When a grea quan i y o gold and sil er was being carried in a procession, Socra es said, "How much here is I do no need!"1 When ambassadors brough i y alen s o Xenocra es2 rom Alexander, a ery large sum or hose days, par icularly a A hens, he carried o he ambassadors o sup wi h him in he Academy and pu be ore hem jus enough o be su icien , wi hou any display.

 Bu Diogenes,3 cer ainly, was more ou spoken, in his quali y o Cynic, when Alexander asked him o name any hing he wan ed: "Jus now," said he, "s and a bi away rom he sun!"4 Alexander apparen ly had in er ered wi h his basking in he hea . And in ac Diogenes, o show how ar superior he was o he King o Persia in he condi ions o his li e, used o argue ha while he had no needs, no hing would e er be enough or he king; he did no miss he pleasures wi h which he king could ne er be sa ed, he king could ne er enjoy he pleasures o he philosopher. n n

 You are, I ake i , aware ha Epicurus has dis inguished di eren kinds o pleasure, no perhaps wi h o er-much exac ness, s ill in a way ha is o ser ice:5 in par , hey are, he says, na ural and necessary, in par na ural and no necessary, in par nei her one nor he o her; n n

 scarcely any hing is required o sa is y he necessary pleasures or he s ores o na ure are a ailable;1 and he second kind o desires is he hinks nei her hard o sa is y nor indeed hard o go wi hou ; he hird kind he hough should be u erly rejec ed, because hey were comple ely meaningless, and so ar rom coun ing as necessary, had no any rela ion o na ure ei her. n n
 n n
 
 A his poin his disciples en er on a long argumen , and hose pleasures which belong o kinds hey despise hey beli le in de ail, ye all he same look ou or a plen i ul supply o all hem.2 For lewd pleasures upon which hey dwell a leng h are, hey say, easy o sa is y, general, wi hin reach o all, and should na ure demand hem, he s andard o alue should, hey hink, no be bir h, posi ion or rank, bu beau y, age, shape, and abs inence is by no means di icul a he call o ei her heal h or du y or repu a ion, and in general his kind o pleasures is desirable, should here be no obs acle, bu is ne er o bene i .3 n n
 n n
 
 The whole eaching o Epicurus abou pleasure is ha pleasure is, he hinks, always o be wished and sough or in and or i sel because i is pleasure, and ha on he same principle pain is always o be a oided or he simple reason ha i is pain, and so he wise man will employ a sys em o coun erbalancing which enables him bo h o a oid pleasure, should i be likely o ensure grea er pain, and submi o pain where i ensures grea er pleasure; n n

 and all pleasurable hings, al hough judged o by he bodily senses, are no wi hs anding ransmi ed on again o he soul;1 n n
 n n
 
 and or his reason while he body eels deligh or he ime ha i has he sensa ion o presen pleasure, i is he soul which has bo h he realiza ion o presen pleasure conjoin ly wi h he body and an icipa es coming pleasure, and does no su er pas pleasure o slip away: hus he wise man will always ha e an unbroken issue o pleasures, as he expec a ion o pleasures hoped or is combined wi h he recollec ion o pleasures already realized. n n
 n n
 
 And similar reasoning is also applied o ood, and he cos ly splendour o banque s is beli led, because hey say na ure is con en ed wi h li le elabora ion. For who does no see ha need is he seasoning or all such hings? When Darius2 in his ligh drank muddy wa er pollu ed by corpses he said he had ne er had a more deligh ul drink; ob iously he had ne er be ore been hirs y when he drank. And P olemy3 had ne er been hungry when he a e or when he was on a progress hrough Egyp and was par ed rom his escor and gi en coarse bread in a co age, i seemed o him ha no hing was more deligh ul han his bread. Socra es, i is said, would walk hard ill e ening, and when he was asked in consequence why he did so, he replied ha by walking he was ge ing hunger as a relish o make a be er dinner.4 n n

 Again! do we no know o he are pu be ore he Lacedaemonians a heir public meals? When he yran Dionysius1 dined wi h hem he said ha he black bro h2 which was he s aple o he meal was no o his as e; whereupon he cook who had made i said: "No wonder; or you did no ha e he seasoning.

In wha na ure can he elemen s be so wonder ully mixed?"3 n n

 Wha charm hen can here be in he li e where here is no prudence, no emperance? This shows us he mis ake o Sardanapalus, he ery weal hy king o Syria, who had car ed upon his omb he lines:
"All I ha e ea en and wan oned and pleasures o lo e I ha e as ed,
These I possess bu ha e le all else o my riches behind me."4
"Wha else," says Aris o le,5 "could one inscribe on he gra e o an ox, no on ha o a king?" He says ha in dea h he possesses he hings which e en in li e he possessed only or he momen o enjoymen . n n

 Why hen should he need o riches be el , or in wha does po er y re use o allow o happiness? S a ues, I suppose; pic ures are your hobby. I here is anyone o ind deligh in hem,

 such u er scorn o dea h ha when, a er being

 wi h a cheer ul and joyous look, and an enemy said
 o him, "Do you scorn he laws o Lycurgus?" he
 replied: "I am deeply gra e ul o him or in lic ing
 upon me a penal y which I could pay wi hou borrow-

 could be proud! So much so, ha o my hinking a
 man o such high spiri was undeser edly condemned. n n

 Such examples our S a e has produced in coun less

 seeing ha Ca o records ha he legions o en

In Ennius' ragedy o ha name: or Neop olemus c . I. § 85.



says ha he mus play he philosopher, bu only a li le way, or o doing so en irely he did no appro e:2

In Pla o's Gorgias, 484 C, Callicles says, φιλοσοφία γάρ τοι ἐστι χαρίεν, ἄν τις αὐτοῦ μετρίως ἅψηται ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ· ἐὰν δὲ περαιτέρω τοῦ δέοντος ἐνδιατρίψῃ, διαφθορὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων. C . also Taci us, Agric. IV, where he says ha Agricola prima in ju en a s udium philosophiae acrius, ul ra quam concessum Romano ac sena ori, hausisse, ni pruden ia ma ris incensum ac lagran em animum coercuisse .



I on he o her hand, Bru us, hink ha or my par I “mus ” play he philosopher; or wha can I busy mysel wi h be er, abo e all a a ime when I ha e no hing o busy mysel wi h? Bu no “a li le way” as Neop olemus said, or i is di icul o ha e a li le knowledge in philosophy wi hou ha ing ei her a grea deal or all ha here is: or nei her can a li le be selec ed excep rom much nor, when a man has learn a li le, will he no also go on wi h he same eagerness o mas er wha remains. n n
 n n
 
 All he same in a busy li e and he li e o a soldier, as Neop olemus hen was, only a li le is o en o grea bene i and bears rui —i no he hea y crop which can be ga hered rom he whole ield o philosophy, ye rui ha can a imes ree us in a measure rom lus or dis ress or ear; as or ins ance he discussion I la ely held a my house a Tusculum seemed o resul in a noble scorn o dea h, and his is o no sligh alue in se ing he soul ree rom ear, n n
 n n
 n
 
 or he man who is a raid o he ine i able can by no manner o means li e wi h a soul a peace; bu he man who is wi hou ear o dea h, no simply because i is una oidable bu also because i has no errors or him, has secured a aluable aid owards rendering li e happy. n n
 n n
 
 And ye I am well assured ha many will argue eagerly agains my iew, bu his i was by no means in my power o a oid excep by wri ing no hing a all. For as regards he speeches in which i was my aim o win he appro al o he mul i ude ( or ora ory is a popular ar and eloquence wins he appro al o he hearers1

The Roman imi a ors o he A ic s yle, according o Cicero, in a oiding ornamen and redundancy succeeded only in being dry and po er y-s ricken.

Cicero says ha he speeches he deli ered in ormer days were cri icised by would-be A icis s or being urgid, bu hey were popular. Wha is o happen o him in his new en ure, when he can no longer coun on popular suppor ?


, n n
 n n
 
 For philosophy is con en wi h ew judges, and o se purpose on her side a oids he mul i ude and is in her urn an objec o suspicion and dislike o hem, wi h he resul ha i anyone should be disposed o n
 re ile all philosophy he could coun on popular suppor , or i he should ry o a ack he school o which we are in he main adheren s, he would ha e power ul assis ance rom he o her schools o philosophy. n n
 
 II. In he Hor ensius, howe er, we ha e replied o he re ilers o philosophy as a whole, whils in he our books o he Academics we ha e se ou , as we hink wi h su icien precision, all ha could be urged on behal o he Academy: all he same we are so ar rom depreca ing cri icism ha we should e en welcome i hear ily, or e en in i s bes days Greek philosophy would ne er ha e been held in such high honour, i he ri alries and disagreemen s o i s chie exponen s had no main ained i s ac i i y. n n
 n n
 
 
 For his reason I encourage all, who ha e he capaci y, o wres rom he now ailing grasp o Greece he renown won rom his ield o s udy and rans er i o his ci y, jus as our ances ors by heir inde a igable zeal rans erred here all he o her really desirable a enues o renown.

 Bu once hese s udies are rans erred o oursel es, we shall ha e no need e en o Greek libraries, in which here is an endless number o books due o he crowd o wri ers; or he same hings are said by many since he day hey crammed he world wi h books and hings will be he same here oo i a larger s ream o wri ers se s oward hese s udies. Bu le us, i we can, s imula e hose who, possessing a liberal educa ion and he power o arguing wi h precision, can deal orderly and me hodically wi h philosophical ques ions. n n

Wha ollowers o his school say and wha hey hink is no unknown o anyone o e en modera e learning. Inasmuch here ore as by heir own showing hey do no rouble how hey express hemsel es, I do no see why hey should be read excep in he circle o hose who hold he same iews and read heir books o one ano her. n n
 n n
 
 For e eryone, e en hose who do no accep heir eaching or are no en husias ic disciples, reads Pla o and he res o he Socra ic school and a er hem heir ollowers, whils scarcely anyone beyond heir own adheren s akes up he works o Epicurus and Me rodorus;2

Me rodorus was a pupil o Epicurus and called by Cicero in De Finibus "paene al er Epicurus." He is no he same as he Scepsius Me rodorus o I. § 59.



similarly hese La in wri ers are only read by hose who appro e heir ene s. n n
 n n
 n
 
 Our opinion on he o her hand is ha e ery hing commi ed o wri ing should appro e i sel o he as e o all educa ed readers, and i we oursel es are unable qui e o succeed in his, we do no or ha reason hink we should aba e our e or s o do so. n n
 n n
 
 Accordingly hese considera ions always led me o pre er he rule o he Peripa e ics and he Academy o discussing bo h sides o e ery ques ion, no only or he reason ha in no o her way did I hink i possible or he probable ru h o be disco ered in each par icular problem, bu also because I ound i ga e he bes prac ice in ora ory. Aris o le irs employed his me hod and la er hose who ollowed him. Philo,1

howe er, as we remember, or we o en heard him lec ure, made a prac ice o eaching he rules o he rhe oricians a one ime, and hose o he philosophers a ano her. I was induced by our riends o ollow his prac ice, and in my house a Tusculum I hus employed he ime a our disposal. Accordingly, a er spending he morning in rhe orical exercises, we wen in he a ernoon, as on he day be ore, down o he Academy,2

Cicero had wo gymnasia a his Tusculan illa, an upper one called Lyceum and a lower one called Academia. Caesar's day on his isi o Cicero, described in Ad A . XIII. 52, was: business ill midday, hen a walk on he shore (bu exercise migh be aken in he illa), hen he ba h, hen dinner abou hal -pas one, and a er ha con ersa ion.



and here a discussion ook place which I do no presen in narra i e orm, bu as nearly as I can in he exac words o our ac ual discussion. n n
 n n
 
 IV. As hen we walked abou he gymnasium our deba e was s ar ed, origina ing in a beginning o pre y much he ollowing charac er. A. I is impossible or me o express he deligh or ra her he eeling o com or I deri ed rom yes erday's discussion, or hough I am no aware o ha ing e er been o er-anxious o li e, ne er heless a shadow o ear and pain occasionally crossed my mind a he hough ha one day here would be an end o his ligh o day and a loss o all he com or s o li e. n n
 n n

 From his kind o dis ress, belie e me, I ha e been relie ed so comple ely ha I hink ha no hing should be less a source o anxie y. n n

 M. There is no hing as onishing in ha , or i shows he e ec o philosophy: i is a physician o souls, akes away he load o emp y roubles, se s us ree rom desires and banishes ears. Bu i s in luence canno be he same or all i s e ec is grea when i has secured a hold upon a charac er sui ed o i . For i is no only rue ha " or une helps he bra e," as he old pro erb says, bu philosophic hough does so in a ar higher degree, and by i s lessons s reng hens as i were he quali y o bra ery. Na ure clearly ga e you a your bir h a cer ain ele a ed and lo y spiri ha looks down on hings ear hly, and so a speech deli ered agains dea h readily ound a res ing place in a bra e soul. Bu can you hink ha hese same argumen s ha e real in luence, apar rom qui e a ew excep ions, wi h he ery men by whom hese argumen s were disco ered, reasoned ou and commi ed o wri ing? How ew philosophers are ound o be so cons i u ed and o ha e principles and a rule o li e so irmly se led as reason requires! how ew here are o hink ha he ene s o heir school are no a display o knowledge bu a law o li e! o con rol hemsel es o heir own will and obey heir own dogmas! n n
 n n
 
 Some o hem we may see guil y o such ri oli y and ani y ha i would ha e been ar be er or hem ne er o ha e been s uden s; o hers are greedy or money, some or ame, many are sla es o heir passions, wi h he resul ha here is a wonder ul disharmony be ween heir alk and heir li es;1

and his o my way o hinking is he mos shame ul hing possible. For jus as a man who pro essed o be a grammarian and spoke like a barbarian, or a man who wished o be considered a musician and sang ou o une, would be all he more con emp ible or ailing in he ery par icular in which he claimed pro iciency, so a philosopher who ails in he conduc o his li e is he more con emp ible in ha his ailure is in he du y o which he se s up o be a eacher, and, whils pro essing an ar o li ing, is a aul in his li e. n n

 V. A. Is i no here ore o be eared, i wha you say is rue, ha you may be decking ou philosophy in borrowed plumes? For wha can be a s ronger proo ha she is o no assis ance han ha some inished philosophers li e disgrace ully? M. Tha is in ru h no proo a all: or jus as all ields ha are illed are no produc i e, and he ollowing lines o Accius are alse:
 Though in o poorer soil good seed be sown
 The crops are ine by heir own na ure grown,
 so all charac ers when cul i a ed do no bear rui . And, o keep o he same comparison, jus as a ield, howe er er ile, can produce no crop wi hou cul i a ion, so he soul can produce none wi hou eaching. So rue is i ha ei her is eeble wi hou he o her. Now he cul i a ion o he soul is philosophy: i pulls ou ices by he roo s and makes souls ready o recei e he seed, and commi s o hem and, so o speak, sows in hem wha , when ully grown, may bear he mos abundan rui . n n

C . Ju enal, Sa . II. 3, who speaks o hypocri ical S oics, Qui Curios simulan e Bacchanalia i un .



and his seems o me a black disgrace. For jus as i is i a eacher claiming o be a grammarian were guil y o solecisms, or one who should wish o be regarded as a musician were o sing ou o une; he disgrace would be enhanced by he ac o his ailure in he ery subjec o which he pro essed he knowledge ; similarly he philosopher who ails o obser e his rule o li e is he more deeply disgraced, because he s umbles in he du y o which he aims a being he eacher and ails in he conduc o li e hough pro essing o gi e he rule o li e. n n
 n n
 
 V. A. I i is as you say, ha e we no reason o ear ha you are ricking ou philosophy in borrowed plumes? Wha s ronger proo o i s uselessness can here be han o ind ins ances o comple ely rained philosophers who lead disgrace ul li es? M. Tha is really no proo , or no all cul i a ed ields are produc i e, and he dic um o Accius2

is alse:

 Though placed in poorer soil good seed can ye n n
 O i s own na ure bear a shining crop, n n
 
 and in he same way no all educa ed minds bear rui . Moreo er, o con inue he same comparison, jus as a ield, howe er good he ground, canno be produc i e wi hou cul i a ion, so he soul canno be produc i e wi hou eaching. So rue i is ha he one wi hou he o her is ine ec i e. Now he cul i a ion o he soul is philosophy; his pulls ou ices by he roo s and makes souls i or he recep ion o seed, and commi s o he soul and, as we may say, sows in i seed o a kind o bear he riches rui when ully grown. n n
 n n
 n
 
 Le us go on hen as we ha e begun; ell me i you will, wha subjec you wish o ha e discussed.
 A. I consider pain he grea es o all e ils. M. Grea er e en han disgrace? A. I do no en ure o go so ar as ha and I am ashamed o ha ing been dislodged so speedily rom my posi ion. M. You should ha e been s ill more ashamed had you clung o i . For wha is more unwor hy han or you o regard any hing as worse han disgrace, crime and baseness? And o escape hese, wha pain should be, I do no say rejec ed, bu should no ra her be olun arily in i ed, endured and welcomed? A. I am en irely o ha opinion. So hen, gran ed ha pain be no indeed he chie e il, an e il i assuredly is. M. Do you see how much o he dread o pain you ha e go rid o , hanks o my brie reminder? n n
 n n
 
 A. I see clearly, bu I wan uller explana ion. M. Well, I shall ry; bu i is a serious under aking and I shall need a soul ha does no quail a he prospec . A. Tha you can coun upon, or as I did yes erday so o-day I shall ollow he argumen whi hersoe er i leads me.
 VI. M. In he irs place hen I shall deal wi h he eebleness o many philosophers belonging o di eren schools o hough . Firs among hem bo h in in luence and da e is Aris ippus he Socra ic,1

Aris ippus, pupil o Socra es and ounder o he Cyrenaic school, o whom he pleasure o he momen was he highes good.



who had no hesi a ion in pronouncing pain o be he chie e il; nex Epicurus len himsel qui e obedien ly o he suppor o his backboneless, e emina e iew; a er him Hieronymus2

Hieronymus belonged o he Peripa e ic school and li ed abou 300 B.C.



o Rhodes said ha he highes good was o be ree o pain: so much e il he hough lay in pain. The res , wi h he excep ion o Zeno,


Aris o and Pyrrho, held pre y nearly he iew you s a ed jus now, namely ha pain was admi edly an e il bu ha here were o her worse e ils. n n
 n n
 n
 
 We see hen ha , hough na ural ins inc and a sense o na i e wor h a once re ol ed agains your saying ha pain is he highes e il, and orced you, when aced wi h disgrace, o abandon your opinion, ye philosophy, he eacher o li e, has main ained ha iew or all hese cen uries.1

Cicero has already excep ed Zeno, Aris o and Pyrrho, so ha he canno mean all philosophers here, bu only ha all along some philosophers held ha pain was he chie e il.



Wha du y, wha repu a ion, wha glory will be o such alue ha he man who has once con inced himsel ha pain is he highes e il will be willing o seek o secure hem a he cos o bodily pain? And ur her wha shame, wha degrada ion will a man no submi o in order o a oid pain, i he has once decided i o be he highes e il? Who moreo er will no eel wre ched, no merely a he momen ha he is o er aken by a acks o ex reme pain, i hey in ol e he highes e il, bu also when he is conscious ha here is he prospec o pain? And who is here beyond i s reach? The resul is ha absolu ely no one can be happy. n n
 n n
 
 Me rodorus2

C . § 8.



no doub hinks ha man comple ely happy who has a good cons i u ion and an assurance ha he will always enjoy i : bu who is here who can ha e such assurance?
 VII. As or Epicurus, howe er, he speaks in a way ha makes him seem o my mind o be pro oking laugh er. For in one passage he asser s ha i he wise man be burn , i he be or ured—you are wai ing perhaps or him o say, "he will submi , will endure, will no yield": high praise by Hercules and wor hy o he grea god Hercules whose name I in oked; bu his is no enough or Epicurus, ha hard s ern spiri ; i he wise man inds himsel inside Phalaris' bull,1

Phalaris was a Sicilian yran o he six h cen ury B. C. who burn his ic ims in a brazen bull. Wha Epicurus said was ha he wise man was happy e en on he rack, κἂν στρεβλωθῇ.



he will say: "How swee ; how indi eren I am o his!" n n
 n n
 n
 
 Ac ually swee ? Or is "no bi er" a bi inadequa e? And ye hose ery philosophers2

The S oics.



who deny ha pain is an e il do no generally go so ar as o say ha i is swee o be or ured; hey say ha i is unpleasing, di icul , ha e ul, con rary o na ure, and ye ha i is no an e il: Epicurus, who says ha pain is he only e il and he wors o all e ils, hinks ha he wise man will pronounce i swee . n n
 n n
 
 For my par I do no require you o describe pain in he same words as Epicurus, ha de o ee, as you know, o pleasure. Le him, i he likes, say he same inside he bull o Phalaris as he would ha e said, had he been in his own bed: I do no a ribu e o wisdom such wonder ul power agains pain. I is enough or du y i he wise man is bra e in endurance; I do no require him o rejoice; or pain is a melancholy condi ion beyond doub , unpleasing, dis as e ul, repugnan o na ure, di icul o submi o and bear. n n
 n n

o my old age, I ollow he example gi en and make diligen use o our poe s; bu whene er hey ail me I ha e o en ransla ed rom he Greek ha La in speech migh no be wi hou any ornamen o his descrip ion. n n
 n n
 n n
 n n\nn
 
 
 ransla ed rom he Greek poe s as well, ha La in eloquence migh no lack any embellishmen in his kind o discussion. n n
 n n
 
 Bu do you no e he harm which poe s do? They represen bra e men wailing, hey ener a e our souls, and besides his hey do i wi h such charm ha hey are no merely read, bu learn by hear . Thus when he in luence o he poe s is combined wi h bad amily discipline and a li e passed in he shade o e emina e seclusion, he s reng h o manliness is comple ely sapped. Pla o1 was righ hen in urning hem ou o his imaginary S a e, when he was rying o ind he highes morali y and he bes condi ions or he communi y. We, howe er, augh no doub by Greek example, bo h read and learn by hear rom boyhood he words o he poe s and regard such ins ruc ion and eaching as a ree man's heri age. n n
Pla o, Rep. II. 398 A.




 n n
 
 XII. Bu why are we angry wi h he poe s? Philosophers, he eachers o ir ue, ha e been ound ready o say ha pain was he highes e il. Bu you, young man, a er saying a li le while ago ha you shared his iew, when asked by me whe her you hough ha i was a grea er e il e en han disgrace, a a word2 abandoned your opinion. Pu he same ques ion o Epicurus: he will say ha a modera e degree o pain is worse e il han he deepes disgrace, or no e il is in ol ed in disgrace alone, unless i should be a ended by pain ul circums ances. Wha pain hen does Epicurus eel when he ac ually a irms ha pain is he grea es e il?3 And ye I canno look o ind any worse disgrace han such a sen imen in he mou h o a philosopher. You here ore ga e me all I wan ed when you replied ha you regarded disgrace as a n n
I.e., direc ly I had spoken, § 14.




For Epicurus said disgrace was no e il unless i was ollowed by pain; ye i pain e er a ends disgrace he ough o ha e su ered pain or saying wha he did.




 n n
 n
 
 grea er e il han pain. For i you hold as simply o his ru h you will realize he resis ance which mus be o ered o pain, and we mus no endea our so much o ask whe her pain be an e il as o s reng hen he soul or he endurance o pain. n n
 n n
 
 The S oics cons ruc oolish syllogisms1 o pro e pain no e il, jus as i he di icul y in ques ion were a erbal one and no one o ma er o ac . Why decei e me, Zeno?2 When you say ha wha is dread ul in my eyes is no an e il a all, I am a rac ed and long o know how i can be rue ha he condi ion I regard as u er wre chedness is no e en e il. “There is no hing e il,” says he, “excep wha is base and wicked.” Now you are alking oolishly, or you do no ake away he cause o my ormen : I know ha pain is no illainy; s op eaching me ha ; ell me ha i makes no di erence whe her I am in pain or no in pain. “I ne er makes any di erence,” says he, “ o he ac o leading a happy li e, which is based on ir ue alone; bu , all he same, pain is o be shunned.”3 Why? “I is unpleasing, agains na ure, hard o endure, melancholy, cruel.” n n
Such as-wha is e il hur s, wha hur s makes worse, pain does no make worse, here ore pain is no an e il-which may secure erbal assen bu does no con ince. C . § 42.




I. 19.




I coun s amongs rejec anea, ἀποπροηγμένα, hings o be rejec ed, bu no "e ils."




 n n
 
 XIII. Here is a lood o words, all o ge a number o di eren expressions or wha we call in a single word “e il.” You are gi ing me a de ini ion o pain, you are no remo ing i , when you say ha i is unpleasing, agains na ure, a hing ha can scarcely be borne or endured, and you do no lie. Bu you should no ha e really yielded he poin under a cloak o aun ing words. “No hing good bu wha is honourable, no hing e il bu wha is base”: his is mere aspira ion, no proo . The n n
 n n
 n
 
 be er and ruer s a emen is ha all such hings as na ure rejec s are coun ed e ils, all such hings as na ure accep s coun as goods.1 Once de ermine his and do away wi h he erbal con ro ersy,2 and i will be ound ha wha he S oics are righ in clinging o, wha we call honourable, righ , becoming, and some imes comprehend under he name o ir ue— his will s ill s and ou in such pre-eminence ha , in comparison, all hings which are held o be goods o body and or une will seem insigni ican and pal ry, whils i will also be ound ha no e il, e en i all e ils were heaped oge her, is o be compared wi h he e il o disgrace. n n
As Pla o, Aris o le and heir ollowers say.




Whe her pain is malum or rejec aneum.




 n n
 
 There ore i , as you admi ed a he ou se , disgrace is worse han pain,3 pain is clearly o no accoun ; or whils you shall hold i base and unwor hy o a man o groan, shriek aloud, wail, break down and be unner ed; so long as honour, so long as nobili y, so long as wor h remain, and so long as you con rol yoursel by keeping your eyes upon hem, assuredly pain will lead o ir ue and grow ain er by a delibera e e or o will; or ei her no ir ue exis s or all pain is o be despised. Do you belie e in he exis ence o prudence, wi hou which we canno so much as realize he meaning o any ir ue? Wha hen? Will prudence4 su er you o do any hing wi hou hereby gaining any ad an age and so only was ing e or uselessly; can i be ha emperance will allow you o ac wi hou sel -res rain ; can jus ice be prac ised by a man who discloses secre s, be rays accomplices, and urns his back on a mul i ude o obliga ions because o he iolence o pain? n n
§ 14.

 n n
 
 How, I ask, will you answer he n n
 n n
 n
 
 claims o courage and i s a endan rain, grea ness o soul, digni y, endurance and con emp o he icissi udes o li e? When you lie crushed and pros ra e, bemoaning your a e in pi i ul accen s, will you hear he words “O how bra e a man!” said o er you? I you are reduced o such s rai s no one will so much as say you are a man. Courage mus here ore go by he board or else a gra e be ound or pain. n n
 n n
 
 XIV. Are you hen unaware ha , i you lose one o your Corin hian ases,1 you can possess he res o your goods in sa e y, bu ha i you lose a single ir ue (and ye ir ue canno be los )2—s ill i you once admi here is a ir ue you do no possess,3 do you no know ha you will possess none a all? n n
Precious ases o me al. The Emperor Augus us was a collec or and called Corin hiarius, c . IV. § 32.




As o whe her ir ue could be los or no he S oics di ered. Clean hes said i was ἀναπόβλητον, Chrysippus ἀποβλητόν.




The S oic eaching was ha all he ir ues were inseparable and he man who had one, had all: Τὰς ἀρετὰς λέγουσιν οἱ Στωικοὶ ἀντακολουθεῖν ἀλλήλοις καὶ τὸν μίαν ἔχοντα πάσας ἔχειν (Diog. Laer . VII. 125). The wise man did all hings in accordance wi h all he ir ues.

 Can you hen possibly regard as a bra e man, as a man o high spiri , enduring, digni ied, as a man who despised or une, ei her he Philoc e es o he poem—? or I pre er no o ake you as my ins ance;4 bu ha was cer ainly no a bra e charac er, who lies
in dwelling dank,
Where rom dumb walls re-echo pi eous sounds
O lamen a ion, plain s and groans and cries.
I do no deny he reali y o pain—why else should courage be wan ed?—bu I say ha i is o ercome by pa ience i only here is a measure o pa ience: i here is none, why do we glori y philosophy and why aun oursel es in i s name? Pain s ings—or i you like le i s rike deep; i you are de enceless, n n

 XV. There is some di erence be ween oil and pain; hey are cer ainly closely rela ed, bu here is a di erence: oil is a men al or physical execu ion o work or du y o more han usual se eri y; pain on he o her hand is disagreeable mo emen in he body, repugnan o he eelings. To hese wo hings our Greek riends, whose language is richer han ours, apply a single erm,4 and accordingly hey call diligen men de o ees o , or ra her lo ers o , pain;5 we n n
Greek has wo dis inc erms, πόνος, labor, and πόνος, dolor. A Greek migh ha e poin ed ou o Cicero ha laborare some imes has a meaning like ha o dolere, c . § 61, quod ehemen er ejus ar us laboraren . For similar remarks abou Greek and La in c . III. § 7.




φιλόπονος has he meaning o indus rius or laboriosus. In con ras o Cicero Lucre ius complains o pa rii sermonis eges as: so do Seneca and Quin ilian. The Greek Tiro, Cicero's amanuensis, reedman and riend, mus ha e been ra her aghas a hese remarks o his.




 n n
 n
 
 more ap ly call hem oilers, or oiling is one hing, eeling pain ano her. O Greece, you are some imes de icien in he words o which you hink you ha e such a plen i ul supply! oiling I say is one hing, eeling pain ano her. When C. Marius had his aricose eins cu ou he el pain;1 when he led his column under a blazing sun he was oiling. All he same here is a sor o resemblance be ween he wo hings, or he habi o oil renders he endurance o pain easier. n n
C . § 53. Marius was born o obscure paren age a Arpinum, Cicero's na i e place.




 n n
 
 Accordingly hose who ga e o Greece he speci ic orm o her go ernmen s were in a our o ha ing young men's bodies s reng hened by oil; he ci izens o Spar a applied he same rule o women, who in all o her ci ies lead a luxurious mode o li e and are “seques ered behind he shadow o walls.” The Spar ans, howe er, wished or no hing o ha sor

I ollows ha pain some imes in er enes in hese

A amous Roman ac or and riend o Cicero. Though he could ac he par o Eurypylus upon he s age, he could no ha e borne he pain o a real wound in ba le like he rained soldier Eurypylus.




 n n
 
 Bu so ar I am dealing wi h he habi which comes rom raining, and no as ye wi h reasoned philosophy. Old women o en endure going wi hou ood or wo or hree days: ake away an a hle e's ood or a single day; he will en rea Olympian Jo e, he grea god in whose honour he is in raining; he will cry ou ha he canno endure i .

The gaun le s were o ox-hide s i ened wi h lead and iron, c . Virg. Aen. 5. 425.

 I is uni ersally agreed hen, no merely by he learned bu by he unlearned as well, ha i is charac eris ic o men who are bra e, high-spiri ed, enduring, and superior o human icissi udes o su er pain wi h pa ience; nor was here anyone, we said, who did no hink ha he man who su ered in his spiri was deser ing o praise. When hen his endurance is bo h required o bra e men and praised when ound, is i no base ei her o shrink rom he coming o pain or ail o bear i s isi a ion? And ye , perhaps, hough all righ -minded s a es are called ir ue, he erm is no appropria e o all ir ues, bu all ha e go he name rom he single ir ue which was ound o ou shine he res , or i is rom he word or “man” ha he word ir ue is deri ed; bu man's peculiar ir ue is or i ude, o which here are wo main unc ions, namely scorn o dea h and scorn o pain.

 You will perhaps ask how, and righ ly so, or such an ar o healing philosophy claims o possess.
XIX. Epicurus s eps orward,—in no sense an ill-meaning person, or ra her a gen leman o he bes in en ions, he gi es ad ice o he ex en o his abili y. “Ignore pain,” he says. Who says his? The same hinker who pronounces pain he highes e il. This is no qui e consis en . Le us lis en. “I pain is a i s highes ,” says he, “i mus be shor .”
“Repea ha once again o me!”1
For I do no qui e unders and wha you mean by “a i s highes ” and wha you mean by “shor .” “By ‘a he highes ’ I mean ha which has no hing higher; by ‘shor ’ I mean ha which has no hing shor er. I scorn a degree o pain rom which a brie space o ime will deli er me almos be ore i has come.” Bu wha i he pain be as se ere as ha o Philoc e es? “I admi i seems o me pre y se ere, bu all he same i is no a he highes ; or his pain is only in he oo ; here can be pain in he eyes, pain in he head, sides, lungs, pain e erywhere. He is here ore ar rom su ering pain a he highes .” “There ore,” says he, “con inuous pain admi s o more o gladness han o exa ion.”2 n n

 n n
 
 Now I canno say ha a man o his eminence is wi hou any sense, bu I hink he is mocking us. I say ha he highes pain—and I say “highes ” e en i here is ano her en a oms worse—, is no consequen ly shor , and I can name a number o wor hy men who, according o heir n n

Bu he cunning rogue ne er ixes he limi ei her o he degree or he con inuance, so as o le me know wha he means by “highes ” in pain or “shor ” in ime. Le us hen pass him o er as saying absolu ely no hing and compel him o admi ha means o relie rom pain are no o be sough rom one who has pronounced pain o be he grea es o all e ils, howe er resolu ely he same person may show a ouch o bra ery in an a ack o colic or a di icul y in passing wa er.1 We mus hen seek or a remedy rom ano her quar er and principally, in ac , i we are looking or wha bes i s he case, rom hose2 in whose eyes he honourable is he highes good and he base he highes e il.

Boys endure rom lo e o ame, o hers endure or shame's sake, many rom ear, and ye are we a raid ha na ure canno pu up wi h wha so many ha e endured in such a number o di eren places? Na ure in ac no only pu s up wi h bu e en demands i ; or she o ers no hing more excellen , no hing more desirable han honour, han renown, han dis inc ion, han glory. By all his number o erms here is only one hing ha I wan o express, n n
 n n

 bu I employ a number, in order o make my meaning as clear as possible. Wha I wan o say in ac is ha ar he bes or man is ha which is desirable in and or i sel , has i s source in ir ue or ra her is based on ir ue, is o i sel praisewor hy, and in ac I should pre er o describe i as he only ra her han he highes good. Moreo er, jus as we use language like his in speaking o wha is honourable, so we use he opposi e in speaking o wha is base: here is no hing so re ol ing, no hing so despicable, no hing more unwor hy o a human being. n n

 And i you are so ar con inced— or you said a he ou se ha you hough here was more e il in disgrace han in pain—, i remains or you o be mas er o yoursel . And ye I do no know by wha righ we so express oursel es, jus as i we had wo sel es, one o be mas er and one o obey: s ill he phrase shows insigh , or he soul is di ided in o wo par s,1 one o which is gi ed wi h reason, while he o her is des i u e o i . n n

 XXI. When hen we are direc ed o be mas ers o oursel es, he meaning o he direc ion is ha reason should be a curb upon recklessness. As a rule, all men's minds con ain na urally an elemen o weakness, despondency, ser ili y, a kind o ner elessness and laccidi y. Had human na ure no hing else, no crea ure would be more hideous han man; bu reason, he mis ress and queen o he world, s ands close a hand and moun ing by her own s reng h and pressing onward she becomes comple ed ir ue.

Such persons here ore we shall ha e almos o keep in chains and guard closely like sla es, whils hose who shall be ound more s ead as , hough no o he highes s reng h, we shall ha e o warn o be mind ul o honour, like good soldiers recalled o du y. The wises hero o Greece when wounded does no wail ex ra agan ly, in he Nip ra;1 ra her should we say he shows due res rain in saying:

Pacu ius ransla ed or imi a ed a play o Sophocles (Νίπτρα ἢ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀκανθοπλήξ) in which he plo urns upon he dea h o Ulysses rom he bone o he s ing-ray sho by his son Telegonus.




 n n
 
 Pacu ius in his surpasses Sophocles— or in Sophocles he wounded Ulysses wails ery pi i ully: all he same he bearers o he wounded man, ha ing an eye o he digni y o his charac er, ac ually do no hesi a e o say o him when he so ly groans:

 You oo Ulysses albei grie ously n n
 S ricken we see, ye a well-nigh e emina e n n
 Spiri you show or a soldier o war are n n
 Li e-long accus omed. n n
 
The wise poe sees ha he cus om o bearing pain is a eacher no o be despised. n n
 n n
 
 And hen Ulysses no a all ex ra agan ly in his grea pain says: n n
 n n
 n
 
 
 
 Hold back! nay hold! o erpowering is he sore, n n
 Lay i bare; misery! I am in or ure. n n

 He begins o lose hold o himsel ; hen a once he pulls up: n n
 
 
 Co er up, co er up, and away or hwi h; n n
 Make ye despa ch; by your handling and shaking n n
 Ye increase he cruel pain o he wounded. n n
 
 n n
 Do you see how i is no he pain o he body which has been quie ed and reduced o silence, bu he pain o he soul which has been chas ened by rebuke and reduced o silence? And so a he end o he Nip ra1 he rebukes o hers as well, and ha in his las momen s:

 This man's du y is: on women's na ure weeping was bes owed. n n

Bu he man in whom here shall be per ec wisdom—we ha e ne er, i is rue, seen a li ing example hi her o, bu his charac er, i only one day he can be ound, is described in he words o philosophers—, such a wise man hen, or ra her such a reason as will be ound in him in comple e and per ec measure, will go ern he lower par o his na ure in he same way as a righ eous paren go erns sons o good charac er; he will secure he carrying ou o his wishes by a hin , wi hou rouble and wi hou exa ion; he will rouse and bes ir himsel , make ready and arm himsel o ace pain like an enemy. Wha are he weapons he will n n
 n n

 Le he ideals which a rue man honours be kep cons an ly be ore his eyes: le him call up he image o Zeno o Elea1 who endured e ery ormen ra her han be brough o di ulge his accomplices in he plo o o er hrow yranny; le him re lec on he s ory o Anaxarchus2 he ollower o Democri us, who ell in o he power o King Timocreon in Cyprus, and wi hou appealing or mercy recoiled rom no orm o or ure. Callanus he Indian,3 an un u ored sa age, born a he oo o he Caucasus, o his own ree-will was burn ali e. We, on he con rary, canno bear a pain in he oo , or a oo hache (bu suppose he whole body is in pain); he reason is ha here is a kind o womanish and ri olous way o hinking exhibi ed in pleasure as much as in pain, which makes our sel -con rol mel and s ream away hrough weakness, and so we canno endure a bee-s ing wi hou crying ou . n n
No he ounder o he S oic philosophy, bu a na i e o Magna Graecia, abou 460 B. C.




Anaxarchus, a na i e o Thrace, was a companion o Alexander he Grea , and a er his dea h was killed by he King o Cyprus, Timocreon or Nicocreon.

And ye he same Marius showed ha he s ing o he pain was se ere, or he did no o er his o her leg; hus being a man he bore pain, being human he re used o bear grea er pain wi hou ac ual necessi y.

 Nor in ac does he bra e, wise man so much as e er groan aloud, unless perhaps o make an in ense e or or s ead as ness, in he way ha runners shou on he race-course as loudly as hey can. A hle es do he same in raining; boxers in ac , a he momen o s riking heir opponen , groan in he ac o swinging heir gaun le s, no ha hey eel pain or are losing hear , bu because by he burs o sound he whole body is made more ense and he blow comes wi h grea er orce.

And as he e ec o s rain is so power ul, we shall indulge in a groan a an access o pain, i i can a ail o s reng hen he soul; bu i he groan is melancholy, weak, desponden , pi eous—I can scarcely gi e he name o man o him who has succumbed.

You call me back o he philosophers who do no o en1 s ep in o he ba le-line, and one o whom, Dionysius o Heraclea,2 a person cer ainly o li le resolu ion, a er learning rom Zeno o be bra e was augh by pain o orge his lesson. For upon an a ack o kidney rouble, e en amid his shrieks, he kep on crying ou ha he opinions he had himsel pre iously held abou pain were alse. And on being asked by Clean hes,3 his ellow-pupil, wha was he reason ha had seduced him rom his ormer opinion, he replied: “Because i ,4 a er I had gi en such de o ed a en ion o philosophy, I ye pro ed unable o bear pain, ha would be su icien proo ha pain was an e il. Now I ha e spen many years in s udying philosophy and am unable o bear pain: pain is here ore an e il.” Then Clean hes s amped wi h his oo upon he ground and, according o he s ory, reci ed a line rom he Epigoni:5

 XXVI. And in all cases all oils ha bring glory and dis inc ion are by he e or hey demand rendered endurable. Do we no see, wi h hose who hold in high es eem he spor s called gymnas ic, ha no pain is shunned by he compe i ors who en er or hem? Moreo er men wi h whom a name or hun ing and horsemanship is alued shrink rom no pain in heir cons an ques o his repu a ion. Why should I speak o our candida ure a elec ions, our desire or o ices o S a e? Would ire and wa er s op he men who once used o ga her in such prizes o e by o e?2 And so, A ricanus, who con inually had Xenophon, he ollower o Socra es, in his hand, used par icularly o praise him or saying ha he same oils in war were no equally se ere or general and soldier, because his posi ion alone made he oil n n

 Bu all he same i does come abou ha an imper ec no ion o honour has i s in luence wi h he unphilosophical ulgar, since hey canno see i s rue na ure; and so hey are swayed by repu a ion and he erdic o he mob in hinking ha honourable which he majori y would appro e.

Nay more, o my mind all hings seem more praisewor hy which are done wi hou glori ica ion and wi hou publici y, no ha his is o be a oided— or all hings done well end o be se in he ligh o day—bu all he same here is no audience or ir ue o higher au hori y han he appro al o conscience. n n

 XXVII. Moreo er le us irs o all re lec upon his poin , ha he endurance o pain, which, as I ha e o en said, mus be s reng hened by an in ense e or o he soul, should show i sel a he same le el in e ery ield. For on many occasions numbers o men ha e bra ely recei ed and bra ely borne n n
 n n
 n
 
 wounds, ei her rom hirs or ic ory or ame, or e en o main ain heir own righ or reedom, and ye he same men, when he s rain o e or is relaxed, are unable o bear he pain o disease; he reason is ha he pain hey had readily endured, hey had endured, no rom principle or he eaching o philosophy, bu rom mo i es ra her o ambi ion and ame. We ind accordingly some unci ilized barbarians able o igh despera ely o he end wi h he sword bu unable o beha e like men in sickness. The Greeks on he o her hand, who are no so ery courageous bu ha e a su iciency o sense answering o heir men al powers, canno look an enemy in he ace;1 and ye hese same men show endurance and spiri , as human beings should, in bearing sickness, while he Cimbri and Cel iberians2 re el in ba le and wail in sickness. For no hing can keep he same le el unless i s ar s wi h ixed principle. n n
Aris o le, Pol. 4. 7. 3, says ha he Greek race was bo h ἔνθυμον καὶ διανοητικόν, no like he nor hern races who were courageous bu unin ellec ual, or he Asia ics who were in ellec ual bu spiri less.




The Cimbri were German, he Cel iberi Spanish.

 Bu since one inds ha men ac ing rom ambi ion or upon un eri ied opinion do no break down under pain in he pursui and a ainmen o heir objec , i should be a du y o hink ei her ha pain is no an e il, or e en i i should be decided o gi e he name o pain o all ha is unpleasan and unna ural, ne er heless, ha his is o such ri ling impor ance ha i is eclipsed by ir ue so comple ely as o be nowhere isible.

For pi y, en y, exul a ion, joy,3 all hese he Greeks erm diseases, mo emen s ha is o he soul which are no obedien o reason;4 we on he o her hand should, I hink, righ ly say ha hese same mo emen s o an agi a ed soul are “disorders,” bu no “diseases” in he ordinary way o speaking, unless you are o ano her opinion. n n
Aegri udo ransla es he Greek λύπη, c . § 83 or i s orms. Tris i ia, “sorrow,” is S . Augus ine's word, c . § 77.




νόσος (c . IV. § 23 νόσημα) is he equi alen o morbus and πάθος o per urba io. For a similar error due o Cicero's zeal in de ence o La in c . II. § 35. As a ma er o ac Greek is be er able o express he abs rac no ions o philosophy han La in, c . I. § 22. The S oics dis inguished our classes o πάθη (irra ional emo ions) gi en in Virg. Aen. 6. 733. Hinc me uun cupiun que dolen gauden que. The S oic order was ἐπιθυμία, φόβος, λύπη, ἡδονή.




These would be πάθη coming under he head o λύπη, aegri udo, and no allowable in he wise man who was ἀπαθής and did no eel desire, grie , anger or joy. The Peripa e ics and Academy hough ha hese emo ions were na ural in origin bu needed res rain .

 A. I hink as you do. M. Do you hink ha hese emo ions come upon he wise man? A. Unques ionably so, I hink. M. 'Pon my word, ha aun ed wisdom o yours is no o be ra ed a a high alue, as i is much he same as unsoundness o mind.5 A. Wha do you mean? Do you regard e ery agi a ion o he soul as unsoundness o mind?

 n n
 
 Now philosophers apply he erm disease o all disorders o he soul and hey say ha no oolish person is ree rom such diseases; su erers rom disease, howe er, are no sound, and he souls o all unwise persons are diseased: here ore all unwise persons are o “unsound” mind]. For hey1 considered ha he sound heal h o souls consis ed in a s a e o equable calm: hey applied he erm “unsoundness” o he mind ha was no in his s a e, because hey hough ha in a disordered soul, as in a disordered body, soundness o heal h was impossible. n n
Our ances ors.




 n n
 
 V. And here was no less insigh in heir gi ing o a condi ion o he soul, marked by an absence o he illumina ing in luence o he mind, he name o “mindlessness” as well as “aberra ion o mind”:2 and rom his we mus unders and ha hose who ga e hese names o such condi ions held he iew which he S oics ook rom Socra es and s eadily adhered o, ha all unwise persons are in an “unsound” s a e. For he soul which is su ering rom some disease—now philosophers as I ha e said apply he erm disease o hese disordered mo emen s —is no more in a sound condi ion han he body which is diseased. I ollows ha wisdom is a sound condi ion o he soul, unwisdom on he o her hand a sor o unheal hiness which is unsoundness and also aberra ion o mind; and hese a ribu es are much be er conno ed by he La in erms han by he Greek, as will be ound also in many o her ins ances.3 Bu o ha elsewhere; now or he business in hand. n n
Amens is he man whose mind has gone: demens he man whose mind has wandered rom he righ way.




In II. § 35 he cri icizes Greek erms in comparison wi h La in. Here his poin seems o be ha he La in erms emphasize be er han Greek he loss o heal hiness and in ellec ha a disordered mind implies. He orge s ἄφρων and παράνοια. Tiro, his Greek secre ary, could ha e old him.




 n n
 n
 
 The na ure hen and meaning o he whole ques ion a issue is shown by he exac orce o he erm.1 For seeing ha i mus be unders ood ha hose, whose mind has no been hrown in o disorder by any mo emen o he na ure o a disease, are in a “sound” condi ion, he erm “unsound” mus be applied o hose who on he con rary are su ering rom disorder. Consequen ly here is no hing be er han he usage o he La in language, where we say ha hose who are unbridled in he indulgence o ei her lus or wra h are beside hemsel es2 ( hough in ac wra h i sel comes under he head o lus , or he de ini ion o wra h is lus o engeance).3 Those hen who are described as beside hemsel es are so described because hey are no under he con rol o mind o which he empire o he whole soul has been assigned by na ure. Now I canno readily gi e he origin o he Greek erm μανία:4 he meaning i ac ually implies is marked wi h be er discrimina ion by us han by he Greeks, or we make a dis inc ion be ween “unsoundness” o mind, which rom i s associa ion wi h olly has a wider conno a ion, and “ renzy.” The Greeks wish o make he dis inc ion bu all shor o success in he erm hey employ: wha we call renzy hey call μελαγχολία,5 jus as i he ru h were ha he mind is in luenced by black bile and no in many ins ances by he s ronger power o wra h or ear or pain, in he sense in which we speak o he renzy o A hamas, Alcmaeon, Ajax and Ores es.6 Whosoe er is so a lic ed is no allowed by he Twel e Tables7 o n n

And hough his seems o be worse han unsoundness o mind, ne er heless here is his o be no ed, ha renzy can come upon he wise man, unsoundness o mind canno .1 Bu his is a di eren problem: le us re urn o our subjec . n n
The wise man, according o he S oics, could no become insane, or insani y is he same as olly, and he wise man could no be oolish. He was s ill a wise man when he was asleep, and similarly he main ained his i le e en i a acked wi h renzy.

 VII. The bra e man is also sel -relian ; or “con iden ” is by a mis aken usage o speech used in a bad sense, hough he word is deri ed rom con idere, “ o ha e rus ,” which implies praise. The sel -relian man, howe er, is assuredly no excessi ely ear ul; or here is a di erence be ween con idence and imidi y. And ye he man who is accessible o dis ress is also accessible o ear. For where hings cause us dis ress by heir presence, we are also n n
 n n
 
 
 n n
 n n\nn
 
 
 a raid o he menace o heir approach. So i comes ha dis ress is incompa ible wi h or i ude. I is here ore probable ha he man who is suscep ible o dis ress is also suscep ible o ear, and indeed o dejec ion and depression o soul. Where men are suscep ible o hese emo ions here also comes a eeling o subjec ion, a readiness o admi hemsel es bea en should occasion arise. He who makes his admission has o admi ear and cowardice as well. Bu o such eelings he bra e man is no suscep ible: here ore he is no suscep ible o dis ress ei her. Bu no one is wise i he is no bra e. There ore he wise man will no be suscep ible o dis ress. n n
 n n
 
 Moreo er he bra e man mus also be high-souled, and he high-souled mus be unconquered; and he unconquered mus look down on human icissi udes and consider hem benea h him. Bu no one can look down upon he hings which can make him su er dis ress. And rom his i ollows ha he bra e man ne er su ers dis ress. Bu all wise men are bra e. There ore he wise man is no suscep ible o dis ress. And jus as he eye, i ou o order, is no in a righ condi ion or discharging i s unc ion, and he o her members, or he body as a whole, i i is no in i s normal condi ion, ails o per orm i s unc ion and work: similarly he soul, i disquie ed, is no i ed o carry ou i s work. Bu he work o he soul is he righ use o reason, and he soul o he wise man is always in a condi ion o make he bes use o reason. There ore i is ne er in a disordered s a e. Bu dis ress is a disorder o he soul. There ore he wise man will always be ree rom i . n n
 n n
 
 VIII. I is also probable ha he empera e man1 n n
The argumen loses i sel in a long digression on erminology wri en in he con ersa ional irregular s yle, which Cicero o en adop s in his dialogues, and is only resumed in § 18 wi h he words Qui si rugi igi ur.




 n n
 n
 
 - he Greeks call him σώφρων, and hey apply he erm σωφροσύνη o he ir ue which I usually call, some imes emperance, some imes sel -con rol, and occasionally also discre ion; bu , i may be, he ir ue could righ ly be called “ rugali y,”1 he erm corresponding o which has a narrower meaning wi h he Greeks, who call “ rugal” men χρήσιμοι, ha is o say simply use ul; bu our erm has a wider meaning, or i conno es all abs inence and ino ensi eness (and his wi h he Greeks has no cus omary erm, bu i is possible o use ἀβλάβεια, harmlessness; or ino ensi eness is a disposi ion o he soul o injure no one)—well, “ rugali y” embraces all he o her ir ues as well; had i s meaning no been so comprehensi e and had i been con ined o he narrow limi s o ordinary accep a ion,2 i would ne er ha e become he much eulogized surname o L. Piso.3 n n
Frugi, rugali as are words which describe he ir ue o he older Romans. Applied o a ield rugi means ha i is produc i e; when rans erred o human beings i means an uprigh , energe ic, pruden , sel -con rolled man who keeps he righ measure in all ha he does, c . IV. § 36. Frugi was he surname gi en o L. Piso: i could also be applied o good sla es. The meaning o rugali as in he main is ha o σωφροσύνη, or ha ir ue bids us use righ reason in all ha we under ake, and implies emperance, sel -con rol, modera ion, s ead as ness and con inence.




i.e. "economical," as in Horace, Sa . 1. 3. 49, Parcius hic i i , rugi dica ur.




Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who gained he cognomen o Frugi, was Consul 133 B.C.




 n n
 
 Bu because nei her he man who hrough ear has deser ed his pos , which is a proo o cowardice, nor he man who hrough a arice has ailed o res ore a rus pri a ely commi ed o him, which is a proo o unrigh eousness, nor he man who hrough rashness has mismanaged a business ransac ion, which is a proo o olly, are usually called “ rugal,” “ rugali y” has come o include he hree ir ues o or i ude, jus ice and prudence: ( hough his is a ea ure common o he ir ues; or n n
 n n
 n
 
 hey are all mu ually linked and bound oge her).1 There ore I coun “ rugali y” by i sel as le o be he our h ir ue. For i seems o be i s special unc ion o guide and compose he eager impulses o he soul and, by a cons an opposi ion o lus , o preser e on e ery occasion a empered irmness: and he ice which is i s opposi e is “wor hlessness.” n n
The ir ues o erlap. In Pla o, Gorgias 507, Socra es argues ha ὁ σώφρων τὰ προσήκοντα πράττοι ἂν καὶ περὶ θεοὺς καὶ περὶ ἀνθρώπους. I he empera e man per orms his du ies o men, he will also be jus , and i he a oids and pursues he hings he ough o, he will also be courageous. The “ rugal” man, Cicero says, shows or i ude, jus ice and prudence. “Frugali y” embraces hese hree and also has i s own peculiar quali y, here ore, says Cicero, “ rugali y” is le or he our h ir ue, emperance. Bu i canno be said ha his " here ore" is clear.




 n n
 
 “Frugali y,” as I hink, is deri ed rom “ rui ” and no hing be er comes rom he ear h: “wor hlessness” is deri ed ( he deri a ion, i may be, will be somewha harsh; bu all he same le us make he a emp ; le i be aken as a jes i i should come o no hing) rom ha which is nequidquam, “ or no hing,” in a man o ha kind; hence he is also said o be “good or no hing.” The man here ore who is “ rugal” or, should you pre er i , sel -res rained and empera e mus be irm; he irm man mus be calm; he calm man mus be ree rom all dis urbance, here ore ree rom dis ress as well. All hese are charac eris ic o he wise man. There ore dis ress will keep ar away rom he wise man. n n
 n n
 
 IX. And so in dealing wi h he passage in Homer where Achilles lamen s o his e ec , I hink:

 Big is he hear in my breas wi h a gloomy swelling o anger, n n
 When I remember ha I ha e been robbed o my honour and glory,2 n n
 
Dionysius o Heraclea3 argues no unskil ully—
Can he hand be in a righ condi ion when su ering rom a swelling? or can any o her limb ail o be n n
Il. 9. 646.




C . II. § 60.




 n n
 n
 
 de ec i e when in a swollen and in lamed s a e? Similarly hen he soul, when pu ed up and swollen, is in a de ec i e s a e. Bu he soul o he wise man is always ree rom de ec and ne er in an in lamed, ne er in a swollen s a e; bu his is he condi ion o he angry soul: here ore he wise man is ne er angry.1 For i he is angry he is also co e ous. The co e ousness peculiar o he angry man is he desire o s amp he brand o u ermos pain upon he person by whom he considers himsel injured. Moreo er he man who has co e ed his end mus necessarily be grea ly rejoiced i he has secured i . Hence i comes abou ha he rejoices in ano her's mis or une. As he wise man is incapable o his, he is also incapable o eeling anger ei her. Bu should he wise man be suscep ible o dis ress, he would also be suscep ible o anger, and as he is ree rom anger he will also be ree rom dis ress. n n
C . § 11.




 n n
 
 For i he wise man could be capable o eeling dis ress he could be also o eeling compassion,2 he could eel en y. (I ha e no said in idia or en y, as i is used where a person is he objec o en y; he word in iden ia, howe er, deri ed rom in idere, can be righ ly used o a oid he ambigui y o in idia3 which comes rom eyeing he prosperi y o a ri al oo narrowly, as in he Melanippus:4

 Who has looked askance upon he promise o my children? n n

The wise man, howe er, does no come o eel en y; here ore he does no come o eel compassion ei her. Bu i he wise man were accus omed o eel dis ress he would also be accus omed o eel compassion.

For as he body, i modera ely ailing, is no heal hy;2 so in he soul he so-called mean or modera e s a e is wi hou heal h. And so our coun rymen, as in many o her ins ances, showed a ine ins inc in gi ing he name o "dis ress" o exa ion, anxie y, and anguish, because o heir resemblance o he condi ion o bodies ou o heal h. n n

The Peripa e ics did no admi he “mean” in a bad s a e. There can be iolen sickness or ri ling ailmen , bu no “mean” be ween hem ha is good, Aris . E h. II. 6. 17.

 By almos he same erm he Greeks describe all dis urbance o he soul; or hey use πάθος,3 ha is o say, "disease," or any roubled mo emen wha e er in he soul. We do be er; or dis ress o soul closely resembles he condi ion o bodies ou o heal h; bu lus does no resemble sickness, in empera e joy does no , which is an exci ed and exuberan pleasure o he soul. Ac ual ear oo is no ery like disease, hough closely akin o dis ress. Bu i is appropria e ha , like sickness in he body, so dis ress in he soul has a name which in meaning is no dis inc rom he meaning o pain. We mus here ore race ou he origin o his pain which is he e icien cause o dis ress in he soul, as i we were diagnosing sickness in he body. For physicians consider ha , when hey ha e disco ered he cause o disease, hey ha e also disco ered he me hod o rea ing i , and similarly we, when we n n

 XI. I is hen wholly in an idea ha we ind he cause no merely indeed o dis ress bu o all o her dis urbances as well, and hese can be classi ied as our wi h numerous subdi isions. For as all dis urbance is a mo emen o he soul ei her des i u e o reason, or con emp uous o reason, or disobedien o reason, and as such a mo emen is pro oked in wo ways, ei her by an idea o good or idea o e il, we ha e our dis urbances equally di ided. For here are wo proceeding rom an idea o good, one o which is exuberan pleasure, ha is o say, joy exci ed beyond measure by he idea o some grea presen good; he second is he in empera e longing or a supposed grea good, and his longing is disobedien o reason, and may be righ ly ermed desire or lus . n n
 n n
 
 There ore hese wo classes, exuberan pleasure and lus springing rom he idea o good, dis urb he soul jus as he wo remaining, ear and dis ress, cause dis urbances by he idea o e il. For ear is he idea o a serious hrea ening e il and dis ress is he idea o a serious presen e il and indeed an idea reshly concei ed o an e il o such sor ha i seems a due reason or anguish; now ha means ha he man who eels he pain belie es ha he ough o eel pain. We mus , howe er, wi h all our migh and main resis hese dis urbances which olly looses and launches like a kind o e il spiri upon he li e o mankind, i we wish o pass our allo ed span in peace and quie .

 XIII. Do you suppose hen ha here is any possibili y o he wise man being o erwhelmed wi h dis ress, ha is o say, wi h wre chedness? Indeed, while all dis urbance is wre chedness, “dis ress” means being ac ually pu upon he rack. Lus in ol es passion, exuberan joy ri oli y, ear degrada ion; bu dis ress in ol es worse hings, i means decay, or ure, agony, hideousness; i rends and corrodes he soul and brings i o absolu e ruin. Unless we s rip i o 3 and manage o ling i away we canno be ree rom wre chedness. n n
C . II. § 20.




 n n
 
 Moreo er his a any ra e is clear, ha dis ress arises rom he impression o some grea e il which seems o be closely bese ing us. Now Epicurus holds ha he dis ress which he idea o e il pro- n n
 n n

Na ural and necessary, Gk. φυσικός. The S oics held dis ress o be con rary o na ure and olun ary.




 n n
 
 The Cyrenaics consider ha dis ress is no caused by e ery e il bu by an unlooked or and unexpec ed e il. Tha , i is rue, has no ordinary e ec in heigh ening dis ress, or all sudden isi a ions seem more serious han o hers. Hence i is ha hese lines are righ ly praised:2

 Also when o Troy I sen hem Greece o igh or and de end, n n
 Well I knew o deadly war are no or eas ing sen I hem. n n

By he Cyrenaics, c . II. § 15, as showing ha e ils an icipa ed are no so dis ressing as unexpec ed e ils. The lines are rom a play o Ennius, where Telamon is speaking o his sons Ajax and Teucer, whom he had sen o war.

 This saying shows ha such e en s are cruel or hose who ha e no re lec ed upon hem. There ore i does no admi o doub ha e ery hing which is hough e il is more grie ous i i comes unexpec edly.2 And so, hough his is no he one cause o he grea es dis ress, ye as oresigh and an icipa ion ha e considerable e ec in lessening pain, a human being should ponder all he icissi udes ha all o man's lo . And do no doub ha here is ound he ideal o ha wisdom which excels and is di ine, namely in he horough s udy and comprehension o human icissi udes, in being as onished a no hing when i happens, and in hinking, be ore he e en is come, ha here is no hing which may no come o pass.

 n n
 
 Bu a more accura e s a emen upon his same subjec is possible, i we irs consider he opinion o Epicurus, who supposes ha all men mus necessarily eel dis ress, i hey hink hemsel es encompassed by e ils, whe her pre iously oreseen and an icipa ed, or long es ablished. For according o him e ils are no lessened by dura ion nor ligh ened by pre ious considera ion, and besides, he hinks i olly o dwell upon an e il which has s ill o come or maybe will no come a all; all e il, he says, is ha e ul enough when i has come; bu he man, who is always hinking a mishap may come, is making ha e il perpe ual: bu i i is no des ined o come a all, he is needlessly he ic im o a n n
 n n
 n
 
 wre chedness he has brough upon himsel : hus he is always or ured ei her by undergoing or by re lec ing on he e il. n n
 n n
 
 Alle ia ion o dis ress, howe er, Epicurus inds in wo direc ions, namely in calling he soul away rom re lec ion upon exa ion and in a “recall”1 o he considera ion o pleasures. For he hinks he soul able o obey reason and ollow i s guidance. Reason here ore (in his iew) orbids a en ion o exa ions, wi hdraws he soul rom morose re lec ions, blun s i s keenness in dwelling upon wre chedness and, sounding a re rea rom such hough s, eagerly urges i on again o descry a arie y o pleasures and engage in hem wi h all he powers o he mind; and according o his philosopher he wise man's li e is packed wi h he recollec ion o pas and he prospec o u ure pleasures. This iew we ha e s a ed in our usual s yle, he Epicureans s a e i in heirs. Bu le us look a heir meaning; heir s yle2 le us ignore. n n
Re oca io is a mili ary me aphor, e.g. recep ui signum au re oca ionem a bello audire non possumus, c . II. § 48. The word is used o calling anyone back rom a course he has begun o an earlier righ course.




Which was uncul i a ed, or Epicurus said, Παιδείαν πᾶσαν, μακάριε, φεύγε.

For here is no hing so well i ed o deaden and alle ia e dis ress as he con inual li e-long re lec ion ha here is no e en which may no happen; no hing so ser iceable as he considera ion o our s a e as human beings, as he s udy o he law o our being and he prac ice o obedience o i ; and he e ec o his is no o make us always sad bu o pre en us rom being so a all. For he man who re lec s upon na ure, upon he di ersi y o li e and he weakness o humani y, is no saddened by re lec ing upon hese hings, bu in doing so he ul ils mos comple ely he unc ion o wisdom. For he gains doubly, in ha by considering he icissi udes o n n
 n n
 n
 
 human li e he has he enjoymen o he peculiar du y o philosophy, and in ad ersi y he inds a hree old relie o aid his res ora ion; n n
 n n
 
 irs because he has long since re lec ed on he possibili y o mishap, and his is ar he bes me hod o lessening and weakening all exa ion; secondly because he unders ands ha he lo o man mus be endured in he spiri o a man; las ly because he sees ha here is no e il bu guil , bu ha here is no guil when he issue is one agains which he can ha e no guaran ee.1 As or ha "recall" which Epicurus ad ises, when he calls us away rom he con empla ion o e il, I do no add i , or i is null and oid. For under he smar o circums ances which we regard as e il, concealmen or orge ulness is no wi hin our con rol: circums ances ear us in pieces, worry and goad us; heir ouch is iery; hey do no allow us o brea he. And do you, Epicurus, bid me " orge ," hough o orge is con rary o na ure, while you wres rom my grasp he aid which na ure has supplied or he relie o long-s anding pain? For here is a remedy, slow-working i is rue bu e ec ual, brough abou by he long lapse o ime. You bid me re lec on good, orge e il. There would be some hing in wha you say and some hing wor hy o a grea philosopher, were you sensible ha hose hings are good which are mos wor hy o a human being. n n

Zeno he Epicurean, a con emporary o Cicero, and named he coryphaeus o Epicurus. He called Socra es scurra A icus and spoke o Chrysippus in ariably as Chrysippa, in scorn o his i le o “ a her,” c . Hor. Sa . 1. 3. 127: Non nos i, quid pa er, inqui , Chrysippus dica .




C . II. § 44.




 n n
 
 You ha e Epicurus' no ion o a happy li e, as ormula ed in he words o Zeno, so ha here is no possibili y o denial.
Wha hen? Will he idea and hough o such a li e a ail o relie e ei her Thyes es or Aee es o whom I spoke a li le while back, or Telamon banished rom his coun ry o be an exile, and a needy one as well, a sigh o whom men asked in as onishmen :

 See we here he amous Telamon whom o hea en glory raised, n n
 Whom men gazed on and Greek aces owards his ace were e er urned? n n
 
 n n
 n n
 
 Bu i anyone ind, as he same poe says, ha “spiri a once wi h or une alls,” he mus look or a remedy rom hose earnes philosophers o old, no rom hese de o ees o pleasure. For wha do hese ri lers mean by abundance o good? Suppose, i n n
 n n
 n
 
 you like, ha he highes good is absence o pain; al hough ha is no ermed pleasure1 bu here is no need o go in o e ery hing now—is i o his we ha e been led on o ind relie or sorrow? Gran , i you like, ha pain is he highes e il; does he man who is no in pain a once enjoy he highes good i he be ree rom e il? n n
For i is an in ermedia e s a e o nei her joy nor pain.




 n n
 
 Why do we shirk he ques ion, Epicurus, and why do we no con ess ha we mean by pleasure wha you habi ually say i is, when you ha e hrown o all sense o shame? Are hese your words or no ? For ins ance, in ha book which embraces all your eaching ( or I shall now play he par o ransla or, ha no one may hink I am in en ing) you say his: “For my par I ind no meaning which I can a ach o wha is ermed good, i I ake away rom i he pleasures ob ained by as e, i I ake away he pleasures which come rom lis ening o music, i I ake away oo he charm deri ed by he eyes rom he sigh o igures in mo emen ,2 or o her pleasures produced by any o he senses in he whole man. Nor indeed is i possible o make such a s a emen as his— ha i is joy o he mind which is alone o be reckoned as a good; or I unders and by a mind in a s a e o joy, ha i is so, when i has he hope o all he pleasures I ha e named— ha is o say he hope ha na ure will be ree o enjoy hem wi hou any blending o pain.” n n
e.g. he dancing o he daugh er o Herodias, Ma h. xi . 6. Epicurus' own words were, οὐ γὰρ ἔγωγε δύναμαι νοῆσαι τἀγαθὸν ἀφαιρῶν μὲν τὰς διὰ χυλῶν ἡδονάς, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ τὰς δι᾽ ἀφροδισίων, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ τὰς δι᾽ ἀκροαμάτων, ἀφαιρῶν δὲ τὰς διὰ μορφῆς κατ᾽ ὄψιν ἡδείας κινήσεις, A hen. VII. 280.




 n n
 
 And his much he says in he words I ha e quo ed, so ha anyone you please may realize wha Epicurus unders ands by pleasure. Then a li le lower: “I ha e o en,” he says, “asked men who were called wise wha con en could be le in a good, i hey ook away he ad an ages named, unless i were o be supposed ha i was n n
 n n
 n
 
 heir wish o u er sen ences des i u e o meaning; I ha e been able o learn no hing rom men who, i hey choose o go on babbling abou ' ir ues' or 'wisdoms,'1 will mean no hing bu he way in which he pleasures I ha e named are brough abou .” n n
They alk grandiloquen ly abou ir ue, bu all hey mean is ha ir ue is use ul or securing pleasure; c . De Fin. V. § 80: Dixeri hoc idem Epicurus, semper bea um esse sapien em; quod quidem sole ebullire nonnunquam, and Mad ig's no e.

 Wha ollows is o he same e ec , and he whole book, which deals wi h he highes good,2 is packed wi h words and sen imen s o similar charac er.

 A magni icen s rain; i brea hes melancholy in he s ory, he dic ion and he rhy hm. Le us sna ch away her dis ress. How? Le us pop her in o a ea her-bed, bring in a harpis , burn a pla er o Coan pas illes, look ou a drop o soo hing syrup and some hing o ea . Here we ha e a las he good hings which enable us o ge rid o he mos grie ous dis resses. For you explained a li le while ago ha you did no e en unders and any o hers. I should here ore agree wi h Epicurus abou he du y o a “recall” rom mourning o re lec ion upon wha was good, i we were agreed upon he meaning o good. n n
 n n
 
 Someone will say: Wha hen? Do you hink Epicurus mean ha sor o hing, or ha his iews were licen ious? I cer ainly do no . For I see ha many o his u erances brea he an aus ere and many a noble spiri .1 Consequen ly, as I ha e o en said, he ques ion a issue is his in elligence, no his morali y. Howe er much he may scorn he pleasures he has jus appro ed, ye I shall remember wha i was ha he hinks he highes good. For he has no only used he erm pleasure, bu s a ed clearly wha he mean by i . “Tas e,” he says, “and embraces and spec acles and music and he shapes o objec s i ed o gi e a pleasan impression o he eyes.” I am no in en ing, I am no misrepresen ing, am I? I long o be re u ed. For why am I exer ing mysel excep o ge he ru h in e ery problem unra elled? n n
e.g. οὐκ ἔστιν ἡδέως ζῆν ἄνευ τοῦ φρονίμως καὶ καλῶς καὶ δικαίως. Diog. Laer . X. 140.




 n n
 
 Bu wai ! Epicurus also says ha pleasure does no increase when pain has been remo ed, and ha he highes pleasure is he absence o pain. Three big mis akes in a ew words. One n n
 n n
 n
 
 because he con radic s himsel . For jus now he said ha he had no e en an inkling o any good, unless he senses were in some sor ickled wi h pleasure; now, on he con rary, he says ha he highes pleasure is reedom rom pain. Is i possible o be more sel -con radic ory? The second mis ake is ha , as hese are hree na ural s a es, one o joy, he second o pain, he hird o nei her joy nor pain, he here hinks he irs and hird iden ical and makes no dis inc ion be ween pleasure and absence o pain. The hird mis ake he shares wi h cer ain philosophers,1 ha , hough ir ue is he objec o our eager seeking and philosophy has been de ised or he sake o securing i , Epicurus has se ered he highes good rom ir ue. n n
Cyrenaics and o hers.

 “Yes, bu he o en praises ir ue.” He does, and so oo C. Gracchus, a er he had gran ed ex ra agan doles and poured ou he unds o he reasury like wa er, none he less, in his words, posed as he pro ec or o he reasury. Why am I o lis en o words, seeing ha I ha e he deeds be ore my eyes? The amous Piso, named Frugi, had spoken consis en ly agains he Corn-law.2 When he law was passed, in spi e o his consular rank, he was here o recei e he corn. Gracchus no iced Piso s anding in he hrong; he asked him in he hearing o he Roman people wha consis ency here was in coming or he corn under he erms o he law which he had opposed. “I shouldn' like i , Gracchus, o come in o your head o di ide up my proper y among all he ci izens; bu should you do so I should come or my share.” Did no he words o his serious and sagacious s a esman show wi h su icien clearness ha he public inheri ance was squandered by he Sempronian n n
The Lex Frumen aria o 123 B. C. by which cheap corn was dis ribu ed o ci izens was proposed by C. Sempronius Gracchus and hence called, as lower down, lex Sempronia. The anecdo e abou Piso ( or whom c . § 16) is in roduced o mark i s e il consequences.




 n n
 n n
 n n\nn
 
 
 law? Read Gracchus' speeches and you will say he was pro ec or o he reasury. n n
 n n
 
 Epicurus says a pleasurable li e is impossible unless accompanied by ir ue; he says ha or une has no power o er he wise man; he pre ers a plain o a rich die ; he says here is no season when he wise man is no happy: all hough s wor hy o a philosopher bu a ariance wi h pleasure. “He does no mean your idea o pleasure.” Le him mean any pleasure he pleases; surely he means pleasure o he kind ha has no share in ir ue. Come, i we do no unders and pleasure, do we unders and pain ei her? There ore I say ha i is no open o he man who measures he highes e il by he s andard o pain o in roduce he name o ir ue. n n
 n n
 
 And ye he Epicureans, excellen crea ures ha hey are ( or ne er was a se o beings less ar ul), complain ha I argue agains Epicurus like a par isan. Ah! hen, I suppose he con es be ween us is one or o ice or posi ion.1 To my hinking he highes good is in he soul, o Epicurus i is in he body; or me i is in ir ue, or him in pleasure. I is he Epicureans who igh , yes, and appeal o he loyal y o heir neighbours; and here are plen y o hem ready o lock in on he ins an :2 i is I who am he one o say ha I am no roubling, ha I shall look upon wha hey ha e se led as se led.3 n n

 There remains he Cyrenaic iew; hey hold ha dis ress arises where an e en has happened unexpec edly.

Ye i is rue ha a sudden ad ance o he enemy causes a good deal more cons erna ion han an ad ance which is expec ed, and a sudden s orm a sea causes more in ense alarm han one ha is an icipa ed, and here are many ins ances o he kind. Bu on a care ul considera ion o he na ure o he unexpec ed you would ind no hing else, excep ha all sudden occurrences are magni ied, and ha or wo reasons: irs because no scope is gi en or weighing he magni ude o he occurrences; secondly because, where i seems ha pre ious precau ions could ha e been aken i su icien oresigh had been shown, he e il incurred, n n

 some years a er, i would no ha e been a remedy or wounds bu only or scars. For s ep by s ep, by slow degrees, pain is lessened as i goes on, no ha he ac ual condi ions are ordinarily changed or can be so, bu experience eaches he lesson which reason should ha e augh be ore, ha he hings once magni ied are smaller han hey seemed. n n
 n n
 
 Wha need is here, hen, someone will say, o argumen , or wha need a all o he com or we usually gi e when we wish o alle ia e he grie o mourners? For we ha e on he ip o our ongues as a rule he words “no hing should seem unexpec ed.” Bu how will he burden o loss be more endurable or he man who has recognized ha some hing o he kind mus happen o a human being? For his way o speaking akes no hing rom he ac ual sum o e il; all i does is o sugges ha no hing has aken place which should no ha e been expec ed. And ye such a mode o speaking is no wi hou e ec in impar ing com or ; I should ra her be inclined o hink i had ery grea e ec . There ore such hings as are unexpec ed do no ha e enough in luence o accoun or all dis ress ha arises; or he shock hey cause is perhaps hea ier, bu hey do no make he occurrences seem more serious; hey seem more serious because heir impression is s ill resh, no because o heir suddenness. n n
 n n
 
 The me hod here ore o disco ering he ru h is wo old, no merely in he case o hings ha seem e il, bu also o hings ha seem good. For we ei her inquire in o he charac er o he ac ual occurrence and i s magni ude, as or ins ance in dealing occasionally wi h po er y, he burden o which we ligh en in argumen by n n
 n n
 n
 
 poin ing ou how small and ew na ural needs are; or lea ing aside nice ies o argumen we gi e ins ances: now Socra es is quo ed, now Diogenes, now Caecilius'1 well-known line:

 E en undernea h he a ered man le o do h wisdom hide. n n
 
For, as he s ress o po er y is one and he same, wha reason can be gi en why C. Fabricius2 ound i endurable whils o hers say i is unbearable? n n

 Similar o his second me hod o com or ing is ha which eaches ha all ha has happened is na ural o human li e. For such a line o argumen no only includes a recogni ion o he ac s o man's condi ion, bu indica es ha wha he res o men ha e borne and are bearing is endurable.
In dealing wi h po er y many ins ances o pa ien endurance are quo ed: in dealing wi h scorn o o ice many are gi en o men who ha e no ob ained o ice and ha e been happier or ha ery reason, and praise is bes owed expressly upon he li e o men who ha e pre erred he re iremen o pri a e li e o a public career, and he well-known anapaes s o ha mos migh y king3 are no passed o er, in which he praises he old man and calls him blessed or being des ined o reach his la es day unhonoured and unknown.4 n n

 Similarly, oo, a en ion is called o hose who ha e los heir children, by gi ing ins ances, and so he sorrow o hose whose grie is excessi e is so ened by he examples n n
 n n

 o o hers who ha e su ered in his way: he endurance o he o hers makes mishaps seem o ar less magni ude han he es ima e irs ormed o hem. So i is ha by re lec ion men gradually realize he ex reme alsi y o heir belie . Moreo er, he amous Telamon poin s he same moral in:

 Wi hin my hear I pondered ills o come,2 n n
 
and Anaxagoras: "I knew ha I had bego en a mor al."3 For all hese, by din o long re lec ion upon he lo o mankind, unders ood ha i mus by no means be regarded wi h he excessi e ear which i s in wi h popular belie . And o my mind he e ec upon wise men o pre ious considera ion is pre y much he same as he e ec o lapse o ime upon o hers; only i is a process o reasoning which res ores he ormer, while na ure le o hersel res ores he la er, when once he roo o he ma er is grasped, namely ha he e il which was grea es in an icipa ion is by no means grea enough o ruin a happy li e. n n

 All, here ore, we need conclude is ha he shock rom he unexpec ed is more se ere, no , as he Cyrenaics hink, ha , where wo men ha e me wi h equal mis or une, only he one on whom he mis or une has come unexpec edly is a ic im o dis ress. And so4 some, i is said, when sadness comes, ha e el a s ill deeper pang on being old o his common lo o mankind, namely ha i is he law o our en ry in o his world ha no one n n
Unexpec ed mis or une is no he only cause o dis ress, and so we ind men grie ing a he ine i able condi ions o human li e. When Solon was mourning he dea h o his son, someone said o him, “Tha will do no good;” and Solon replied, “I is or ha ery reason I weep, because I can do no good.”




 n n

 can permanen ly escape e il. n n
 n n

 I was or his reason ha Carneades, as I see our riend An iochus1 s a es, habi ually censured Chrysippus or his appro al o he well-known passage in Euripides:

No mor al is here bu pain inds him ou n n
And sickness; many mus heir children bury, n n
And sow resh issue; dea h is end or all; n n
In ain do hese hings ex he race o men, n n
Ear h mus go back o ear h: hen li e by all n n
Like crops is har es ed. So mus i be. n n
 n n2
He said ha his way o speaking had no bearing a all on he alle ia ion o dis ress; or he argued ha he ac ual call o grie came rom he ac ha we were subjec o a necessi y so cruel. For Euripides' way o speaking was sui ed o bring com or o ill-disposed people rom he reci al o he e ils o o hers. My iew, howe er, is ar di eren . For he hough ha he lo o man mus be endured pre en s us rom con ending as i were agains God and also warns us ha we are human: and his re lec ion is a grea relie o sorrow, and he de ailed ins ances ci ed are no gi en o deligh he mind o he ill-na ured, bu o lead he mourner o hink ha he mus bear he burdens which he sees many men ha e borne in a spiri o quie res rain . n n
 n n

For we mus , as i were, shore up in e ery way hose who are oppling o er and unable o s and because o he ex en o heir dis ress. Hence, Chrysippus hinks ha dis ress ge s i s own name λύπη3 as being a dissolu ion o he whole man, and i can be en irely roo ed ou when we ha e n n

 disen angled i s cause, as I said a he ou se . For i is no hing else han he idea and con ic ion o an ins an and pressing grea e il. Consequen ly physical pain, he smar o which is exceedingly keen, is endured when we can see be ore us he promise o good, and a li e spen honourably and brillian ly a ords a solace so comple e ha ei her no ouch o dis ress approaches hose who ha e li ed such a li e, or else he prick o pain in he soul is only super icial. n n
 n n
 
 Bu when, in addi ion o he idea o serious e il, we en er ain also he idea ha i is an obliga ion, ha i is righ , ha i is a ma er o du y o be dis ressed a wha has happened,1 hen, and no be ore, he dis urbing e ec o deep dis ress ensues. n n
e.g. a he dea h o rela i es or riends.




 n n
 
 In consequence o his idea come he di eren odious orms o mourning, neglec o person, women's rending o he cheeks, bea ings o he breas and highs and head. Hence he amous Agamemnon o Homer and Accius oo,2
 
 O earing in his grie his unshorn hair, n n
 
which inspired he wi icism o Bion3 ha he ool o a monarch plucked ou his hair in his grie , or all he world as hough baldness were a relie o sadness. n n

 In he Aleïan plain he desola e wandered in sorrow, n n
 Ea ing his hear ou alone, and he oo s eps o men he a oided. n n
 
And Niobe2 is imagined in s one o represen , I suppose, e erlas ing silence in sorrow, while hey hink ha Hecuba on he o her hand, by reason o a sor o ierceness and ury o soul, was imagined o ha e been changed in o a bi ch.3 There are, moreo er, o her mourners who o en ind deligh in holding con erse wi h soli ude i sel , like he well-known nurse in Ennius:

 All hese hings hey do in he hour o grie , in he idea ha such hings are righ and proper and obliga ory, and he chie proo ha hey are done rom a sor o con ic ion o du y is shown by he ac ha , i any o hose who hink hey should be sorrow ul chance o beha e in a more human or cheer ul way, hey resume a gloomy demeanour and accuse hemsel es o misconduc because o his in errup ion o heir grie : indeed mo hers and eachers are e en accus omed o punish children, i in he mids o amily sorrow hey show any undue cheer ulness in ac or speech, and no merely wi h words bu e en wi h he whip hey n n

 Wha does he sel - ormen ing charac er—in Greek ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος —say in Terence?

 So long as I mysel am miserable.1 n n
 
He resol es o be miserable. Can you hink anyone akes a resolu ion agains his will?

 So ha no respi e here is or any rom sorrow o mourning; n n

 I was common alk ha hose who saw Cn.

There ore ear had he power o dri e away heir dis ress, and shall no reason ha e power o dri e i away rom he wise man? n n

 Wha , howe er, has more e ec in pu ing grie aside han he realiza ion o he ac ha i gains us no ad an age and ha indulgence in i is useless? I hen i can be se aside, i is also possible o re rain rom indulging in i . I mus here ore be admi ed ha dis ress is an indulgence due o an ac o will and o con ic ion. n n
 n n
 
 And ha is signi ied by he endurance o hose who submi more readily o any mishap a er hey ha e requen ly been hrough many experiences and who hink hey ha e a las succeeded in hardening hemsel es agains or une, like he charac er in Euripides:

 Good cause had been o oss like new-yoked col n n
 Bu la ely brough o bear he ouch o bi ; n n

Since, hen, he exhaus ion brough by miseries renders dis resses milder, i mus be unders ood ha i is no he mis or une i sel ha is heir cause and origin. n n

 Do no philosophers o he highes eminence, who all he same ha e no ye a ained he s a e o "wisdom," unders and ha hey are in a pligh o u er e il?1 For hey are unwise, and here is no grea er e il han unwisdom; ye hey do no lamen . Why is his? Because o his kind o e il here is no adap ing he belie ha i is righ and regular and a ma er o du y o eel dis ressed a no being wise, whereas we do adap his belie o he kind o dis ress ha in ol es mourning, and such dis ress is he grea es o all. n n

 And so Aris o le2 in upbraiding he philosophers o old or hinking, according o him, ha hanks o heir genius philosophy had reached per ec ion, says ha hey had been guil y o ex reme olly or boas ulness; all he same he adds ha he saw ha , as a consequence o he grea ad ance made in a ew years, philosophy would be absolu ely comple e.

And so he hero Oileus in Sophocles,3 hough he had pre iously consoled Telamon or he dea h o Ajax, ye broke down when he heard o his own son's dea h. His change o mind is hus described:

 When hey argue in his way heir objec is o pro e ha here is no possible means o wi hs anding na ure: ye hey admi ha men are ic ims o dis ress more grie ous han na ure en orces. Wha hen is he “madness” hey speak o ?— o pu o hem he same ques ion as hey pu o us.1 n n
The opponen s who say, “Who is so mad as o mourn o his own choice?” Bu hey admi ha in eeling dis ress men go ur her han na ure requires. “Well, are hey no hen as 'mad' as hose who mourn olun arily?” answers Cicero.

 Bu here are more reasons han one or alling a ic im o grie . Firs here is he belie already spoken o ha a hing is e il, and a he sigh o i and he con ic ion o i s presence dis ress ine i ably ollows. Secondly men also hink ha by he in ensi y o heir grie hey are gra i ying he dead. Add o hese a cer ain womanish supers i ion; or hey hink hey will more easily sa is y he immor al gods, i hey admi ha hey are crushed and pros ra ed by an o erwhelming blow. Bu he majori y do no see how inconsis en hese ideas are. For hey praise hose who, hey hink, mee dea h calmly; any who bear ano her's dea h wi h calmness hey consider deser ing o censure. As i i were in any sense possible, as is o en said in lo ers' alk, ha anyone should lo e ano her more han himsel . n n

 I is an excellen hing, and i you look in o i , a righ and jus hing oo o lo e hose, who should be our deares , as well as we do oursel es; bu o lo e hem more han oursel es is in no way possible. I is no o be desired in riendship ei her ha my riend should lo e me more han himsel , or I lo e him more han mysel ; i i could be so, i would resul in an upse o li e and all i s obliga ions. n n

 Bu his ques ion can be deal wi h a ano her ime: or he presen i is enough o re rain rom making oursel es wre ched as well as losing our riends, or ear our lo e go ur her han n n

 hey hemsel es would wish i hey were conscious, cer ainly ur her han our lo e or oursel es. n n

 As o heir objec ion ha mos men ge no relie rom words o com or , and he addi ional one, ha he com or ers hemsel es admi ha hey are wre ched when or une has shi ed her a ack o hem, each s a emen admi s o re u a ion.

For bo h hose who ge no relie are wre ched by heir own in i a ion, and hose, who bear heir own mis or unes in a spiri di eren rom ha which hey ha e hemsel es ad oca ed in he case o o hers, are no worse han, as a rule, many a aricious men who censure he a aricious, or ambi ious men who censure he ambi ious; or i is a peculiari y o olly o discern he aul s o o hers and be orge ul o i s own. n n

 Bu beyond ques ion, since i is agreed ha dis ress is remo ed by long con inuance, he chie proo 3 is he ac ha i is no he mere lapse o ime ha produces his e ec , bu con inued re lec ion. For i he circums ances are he same and he person is he same, how can here be any change in he grie el , i here is no change ei her in he reason or he grie or in he person who eels i ? Con inued re lec ion here ore ha here is no e il in he circums ances has a healing e ec upon pain, no he con inuance o ime alone.
A his poin hey con ron me wi h heir “mean”4 s a es. I hese are based upon na ure, wha need is here o gi ing com or ? For na ure will hersel ix he limi ; bu i hey are based on belie , hen le he belie be comple ely se aside. n n

 I has, I hink, been su icien ly insis ed on ha dis ress is he idea o a presen e il wi h his implica ion in i , ha i is a du y o eel dis ress. An addi ion o his de ini ion is righ ly made by Zeno, namely ha his idea o a presen e il is a “ resh”1 one. This word, howe er, his ollowers in erpre o mean ha no only, according o heir iew, is ha “ resh” which has aken place a shor ime pre iously, bu ha so long as he imagined e il preser es a cer ain power o being igorous and re aining so o speak i s greenness,2 i is ermed “ resh.” For ins ance he amous Ar emisia, wi e o Mausolus, King o Caria, who buil he celebra ed burial monumen a Halicarnassus, li ed in sorrow all her days and was ed away under i s en eebling in luence. The idea o her sorrow was “ resh” or her e ery day, and his idea only ceases o be ermed “ resh” when i has wi hered away by leng h o ime. n n
The πάθη, per urba iones, emo ions, were according o he S oics olun ary, and judgmen s (κρίσεις) res ing on an idea or belie (δόξα). Time could weaken heir e ec , bu i hey re ained heir igour, hey coun ed as " resh" or newly concei ed.

 his olly, no his sorrow; he season or he lesson is, howe er, un a ourable. And ye i seems o me Clean hes has no qui e seen ha he eeling o dis ress can some imes arise rom he ery hing which he himsel admi s o be he wors e il o all. For wha shall we say—seeing ha Socra es, as we are old, con inced Alcibiades ha he was in no rue sense a man and ha here was no di erence, or all his high posi ion, be ween him and any poor por er, whereupon Alcibiades was much dis ressed and implored Socra es wi h ears o each him ir ue and dri e baseness away,—wha shall we say, Clean hes? Surely no ha here was no e il in he cause which made Alcibiades eel dis ress?1 n n
This s ory is no in Pla o. I is gi en in Augus ine C.D. XIV. 8. Socra es showed Alcibiades ha he was wre ched because o his olly. Alcibiades was dis ressed because he was no wha he ough o ha e been, i.e. was base, which Clean hes says is he wors o all e ils. Clean hes can only say ha he "wise man "is ree rom e il and canno eel dis ress or sorrow: Lyco says ha dis ress is occasioned by ri les. Wha can ei her o hem do or Alcibiades? Is his dis ress real or no ? Is i or is i no due o "e il"? To S . Augus ine i is sorrow ( ris i ia), akin o he "godly sorrow "o 2 Cor. 7. 10, c . § 7.




 n n
 
 Wha o his? Wha is he meaning o Lyco's words?2 By way o minimizing dis ress he says ha i is occasioned by ri ling circums ances, discom or s o or une and o body, no by e ils o he soul. I ask you hen: he grie which Alcibiades el , did i no come rom e ils and laws in he soul? As or he com or Epicurus sugges s, enough has been pre iously said. n n

For we ha e o poin ou how each o hose who bore his su erings wisely, managed o bear hem, and no poin ou he incon enience under which he laboured. n n

 The com or sugges ed by Chrysippus,1 regarded in he abs rac , is he mos reliable, bu di icul or a ime o dis ress. I is a hard ma er o pro e o a mourner ha he is mourning o his own choice and because he hinks he ough o do so. No need o wonder hen ha in he conduc o cases in cour we do no always ake up he same posi ion2 ( his is he erm we apply o lines o argumen in dispu es), bu we adap he line we ake o he occasion, o he charac er o he dispu e, o he personali y o he li igan ; we ac similarly in he alle ia ion o dis ress, or we ha e o consider wha me hod o rea men is admissible in each par icular case. n n

Ne er heless he course o our argumen has shown, i appears o me, ha hough he ac ual ques ion, whe her any hing was e il unless i could also be described as disgrace ul, was no speci ically pu a he ime—ne er heless, I say, we ha e come o see ha , wha e er e il here is in dis ress, i is no due o na ure, bu brough o a head by a judgmen o he will and by mis aken belie . n n
