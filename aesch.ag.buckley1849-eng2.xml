          I have a night-bewildered and dew-drenched couch <ref n="96.1">1</ref>, not visited by dreams, for fear, in place of sleep, stands at my side, so that I cannot firmly close my eyelids in slumber. And when I think to sing or whistle, preparing <ref n="96.2">2</ref> this the counter-charm of song against sleep, then do I mourn, sighing over the sad condition of this house, that is not, as of yore, most excellently administered. But now, may there be a happy release from my toils, as the fire of joyous tidings appears through the gloom! Oh hail! thou lamp of night, thou that displayest a light like as the day, and the marshalling of many dances in Argos, on account of this event <ref n="96.3">3</ref>. Ho! ho! I will give a signal distinctly to the wife of Agamemnon, that she, having arisen with all speed from her couch, may raise aloud a joyous shout in welcome to this beacon, if indeed the city of Ilion is taken, as the beacon-light stands forth <ref n="96.4">4</ref> announcing; and I myself will dance a prelude. For I will count the throws <ref n="96.6">6</ref> of my lord that have fallen well, mine own <ref n="96.5">5</ref>, since this kindling of the beacon-light has cast me thrice six. May it then befall me to grasp with this hand of mine the friendly hand of the sovereign of this palace on his arrival.

          Greeks and Trojans alike, on account of the wife of many husbands, many limb-wearying struggles, when the knee is strained in the dust, and the spear-staff is shivered in the onset. But things are as they are; and will be brought to the issue doomed. Neither by weeping nor by pouring libations, nor by shedding tears, will he soothe away the intense wrath of fireless rites <ref n="98.1">1</ref>. But we, with our unhonoured aged frame, remain left behind the armament of that time, propping on staves our childlike strength. For both the marrow of youth shooting up within our breasts is weak as age, and Mars is not in place; and very advanced age likewise, after that its foliage is already withered, totters along its three-footed path, and nought superior to a child, flits like a day-dream. But thou, daughter of Tyndarus, Queen Clytemnestra, what means this? what new event? what is it that thou hast heard, and on the faith of what tidings art thou burning incense sent around <ref n="98.2">2</ref>? and the altars of all our city-guarding gods, of those above and those below, gods of heaven and gods of the forum, are blazing with offerings: and in different directions different flames are streaming upward, high as heaven, drugged with the mild unadulterated cordials of pure unguent, with the royal cake, brought from the inmost cells <ref n="98.3">3</ref>. Concerning these things tell one both what is possible and lawful for thee to say <ref n="98.4">4</ref>, and become thou the healer of this distracting anxiety, which now one while is full of evil

And if we consider the connexion of the sense, this is clearly required by the context from v. 40, as follows : The AtridAe hover over the heads of those who stole away Helen, like vultures mourning over their lost young. But as some god sends an Erinnys to aid the birds, so Jove sends the AtridAe against Paris, bringing a doubtful contest upon both Greeks and Trojans. But the end of all will be as fate decrees. Nor by any means will Agamemnon avert the unflinching wrath resulting from Iphigentia’s death." The chorus darkly hints at the consequences of Agamemnon's connexion with Menelaus, which are more fully explained hereafter.

And jealous vexation creeps upon the chieftain Atrida <ref n="109.1">1</ref>. And others, fair of form, there around the walls, occupy tombs in the land of Ilion; and a foe-land shrouds them as its dwellers.

And my anxious care is waiting to hear something wrapt in nightly gloom. For the gods are not regardless of those that occasion great slaughter: and the black Erinnyes in time, reduce to obscurity the man that is fortunate without righteousness, by a reverse of fortune; and the power of him that lives among the obscure is nought.

<p>Yea, for we have fared well. But this in a long time one might say that some things fall out well, but others on the contrary are open to complaint; for who, save the gods, is free from suffering throughout all time for evermore? For were I to tell our hardships, and our bad lodgments, our approaches [to the shore] infrequent and ill-bedded,—and in what part of the day were we not sighing, as not having met with our portion<ref n="112.2">2</ref>?—And then again the ills on shore were added, more loathly still: for our beds were hard by the walls of our foes : and from the sky and from the soil the meadow-dews drizzled on us, a deep rankling destruction to our garments making our hair shaggy. And were any one to describe the winter, death to birds, how intolerable the snow of Ida made it, or the sultriness, when ocean, having sunk upon his noon-tide couch unruffled by a breeze, slumbered<ref n="112.3">3</ref> without a ripple.—What need is there to grieve over this? the toil is past—past too with the dead is even the thought about ever hereafter rising. Why need one take exact account of those that fell, and why should the survivor feel sorrowed on account of adverse hap? I deem it good to bid a long farewell to misfortunes. With us, the remnant of the host of the Argives, the advantage preponderates, the suffering counterpoises not: wherefore it is fair for us, flying over sea and land, to make our boast to this light of the sun. <quote xml:lang="grc">"The armament of the Greeks, having at length captured Troy, have fixed these spoils as a glory to the ancient shrine<ref n="112.4">4</ref> of the gods throughout Greece."</quote> Those that hear such tidings must glorify our city and our commanders; and the favour of Jove, which hath brought this to pass, shall be honoured.

For fire and sea, of old most deadly foes, conspired together, and proved their faithful plight, destroying the hapless armament of the Greeks.

<p>First of all it is right to salute Argos and the gods of the land that were joint authors of my return, and of the redress which I exacted from the city of Priam: for the gods, not hearing our plea from the tongue, flung without hesitation into the gory vase their ballots, the destruction of Ilion fatal to men, and o'er the opposite urn that was not filled by the hand Hope hovered. And now, still the city by its smoke shews evidently that it has been captured. The storms of <unclear>Atè</unclear> are alive; and the embers, dying along with the city, send forth rich exhalations of wealth. For these things it behoves us to repay ever mindful gratitude to the gods; since we both formed for ourselves<ref n="119.1">1</ref> a proud gin of conquest, and in a woman's cause the Argive monster bath levelled the city with the dust,—the young of the horse, the host equipped with shield, that leaped a furious bound, about the setting of the Pleiades<ref n="119.2">2</ref>, and the ravening lion springing over the towers bath lapped his fill of princely blood.

The stoppages at Aulis, and under the walls of Troy, are evidently meant. In other respects, Conington's view is confirmed by the tragedians, and by Dion. Chrysost. Or.

And if timidity, fling away a part, with a well-measured cast of the sling, in defence of its wealth in possession, the entire fabric sinks not, teeming too full of woe, nor does it make the bark to founder. Often, in sooth, an ample boon from Jove, and from the yearly furrows, quells the pangs of famine. But who can recall by charms a man’s black death-shed blood, when once it has fallen on the ground before [his feet] ? Otherwise Jove would not have put an end to the leech<ref n="125.2">2</ref> that knew the right way to bring back the departed into safety. And if Fate ordained by the gods did not prevent my fate<ref n="125.3">3</ref> availing more, my heart, having ontstripped my tongue, would have poured forth the tale ; but now it moans beneath the gloom, soul grieving, and entertaining no farther hope of ever unravelling any thing seasonable, while my mind is kindled with inward flame.</p>

<p>O kindly light of the day that brings retribution. Now I would pronounce that gods, the punishers of mortals from on high, look down upon the abominations of earth, beholding this man here lying, as is delightful to me, in the woven robes of the Furies, paying the penalty of the devices of his father's hand. For Atreus, the ruler of this land, his father, being a rival about the power, that I may speak clearly, banished from his city and his house Thyestes my father, his own brother. And wretched Thyestes, having come again a suppliant at the hearth, found a secure lot, so that he should not dying stain his paternal soil with his blood. But Atreus, the godless father of this man, with more zeal than love, pretending cheerfully to hold a day of banqueting by way of welcome to my father, served him a banquet of his children's flesh. The parts about the feet indeed, and the comb-like tips of the fingers, seated apart, he broke from those above<ref n="142.1">1</ref>. And. having immediately in ignorance taken that part of the flesh which could not be distinguished, he eats a food, as thou seest, destructive to the race. And then, having discovered the unholy deed, he screamed, and falls back from the butchery vomiting: and on the descendants of Pelops he imprecates an intolerable doom, rightfully devoted to a curse the insult of the board<ref n="142.2">2</ref>,
