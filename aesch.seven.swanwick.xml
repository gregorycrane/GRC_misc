            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE trilogy to which this drama belonged was represented B.C. 467, five years after<ref n="263.1">*</ref> "The Persians," and consisted, as we learn from the Didascalia given in the Medicean manuscript, of Laios, Edipus, and "The Seven against Thebes," followed by the Satyric drama of the Sphinx. It has been appropriately styled the dramatic epos of the House of Labdacos, for though the conflicting emotions in the soul of Eteocles are portrayed with true tragic insight, yet in "The Seven," as in "The Persians," narrative so far preponderates over action as to render the treatment of their respective subjects epic rather than dramatic.</p>
          <p>In this, as in the other dramas of Æschylus, the aim of the poet is to vindicate the divine government, and to exhibit the ultimate triumph of order and justice. The principle more especially emphasized, that of divine retribution—" the key-stone of the universal order"—was embodied by the Greeks in the word Nemesis: passing from the domain of conscience, it became in later times a divinity, and has been aptly characterized by Bunsen as the “Muse of Justice." In accordance with her teaching, the eternal laws can <pb n="264"/> never be violated with impunity: with sleepless vigilance the dread avenger follows on the track of crime: for a season, perhaps, no muttering is heard of the coming storm; but not the less inevitably does punishment eventually overtake the wrongdoer, or his posterity. Associated with this inexorable law of retribution, the poet, in the Theban tragedy, exhibits the working of those mysterious tendencies to moral evil which, like hereditary disease, not unfrequently accompany the fatal heritage of crime, and which, if not counteracted by the force of personal will, issue in the final destruction of the sin-polluted race. A brief outline of the hoary legend, the main features of which would doubtless be embodied in the first two members of the trilogy, the Laios and the Edipus, is essential for the due appreciation of the concluding drama.<ref n="264.1">*</ref></p>
          <p>The crime of Laios may be regarded as the fatal seed-corn from which he and his descendants reaped a tear-fraught harvest. This is indicated in the choral ode of " The Seven against Thebes" (v. 737), which it has been truly said strikes the key-note of the drama. Received as a guest into the house of Pelops, he, according to the legend, carried off Chrysippus, the son of his host, whose curse against the ravisher is subsequently confirmed by Apollo, who thrice warns him from his sacred shrine to save the State by dying childless. Heedless of the divine monition, he, in an <pb n="265"/> evil hour, “begat his proper woe, in Edipus the parricide " (v. 747).</p>
          <p>Laios, in order to evade the oracle which had declared that himself would be slain by any son whom he might beget, caused the infant, as soon as born, to be exposed on Mount Cithæron, the savage scenery of which harmonizes with the dark passages of Hellenic lore with which it is associated. Here he is found by the herdsmen of Polybos, king of Corinth, who carry him to their master, by whom he is reared as his own child. When grown to manhood, doubts having been cast upon his descent, he repairs to Delphi, in order to discover the truth as to his parentage. Warned by the oracle not to return to his country, he proceeds towards Bœotia, and at the spot called the divided way, encounters Laios, whom in a skirmish he slays, not knowing him to be his father. Pursuing his journey he arrives at Thebes, where, after solving the riddle of the Sphinx, he obtains the kingdom, and marries Jocasta, by whom he becomes the father of two sons, Eteocles and Polyneikes, and of two daughters, Antigone and Ismene. The truth respecting his unhappy marriage being at length brought to light, he in despair puts out his eyes, and resigns the government to his sons. They, wishing that the family shame should be concealed from the eyes of men, place him in confinement, and it is related in one fragment of the Thebais, that instead of the shoulder of the victims sacrificed on the altar, they sent him the less honourable portions. This, in his rage, he cast upon the <pb n="266"/> ground, and, at the same time, prayed to the gods that his sons might perish, each by the hand of the other. Reference appears to be made to this ancient form of the tradition in the Seven (v. 787). The brothers, fearing lest their father's curse should be fulfilled, make an agreement to reign over the Theban territory in turn, each for the space of a year. Eteocles, as the elder, reigns first, and at the appointed time Polyneikes comes to demand the sceptre, which his brother refuses to resign. Polyneikes retires to Argos, and persuades Adrastos, his father-in-law, to assist him to recover the throne. Accordingly, that prince and five other chiefs, accompanied by Polyneikes, march against the Cadmeian city. With their appearance before the walls the third member of the trilogy opens.</p>
          <p>Such, in outline, is the terrible story which ushers in “The Seven against Thebes." The first tragedy probably ended with the death of Laios, while the wrath of Edipus, and his curse, twice pronounced against his sons, would doubtless form a principal feature of the second drama. This we may infer from the prominence given to the curse in the concluding member of the trilogy.</p>
          <p>I cannot but think, however, that we should misread the poet did we imagine that the death of the brothers resulted from the inevitable operation of their father's curse. Eteocles, though courageous, is full of insatiable rage, and instead of yielding to the pathetic pleading of the Chorus, exults in the prospect of fratricide; while Polyneikes is represented as sharing <pb n="267"/> the malignant hatred of his brother (v. 632). Eteocles, moreover, by retaining the sovereignty, violates the claims of justice; and Polyneikes, by seeking to regain it with the assistance of an invading host, is guilty of impiety towards his country: thus the death of the brothers, through mutual slaughter, is the penalty due to their respective wrongdoing, and, as such, offers no violence to our sense of justice. King Apollo, it is true, the awful Seventh, is represented as taking his station at the seventh gate, and avenging upon the sons of Edipus the ancient transgression of Laios; at the same time the poet makes us feel that they have themselves succumbed to the evil tendencies inherent in the race, and thus it is that their father's curse has exercised its dread ascendency over their destiny.</p>
          <p>Had the trilogy terminated with the death of the brothers such a catastrophe would have violated an essential canon of classical dramatic art, which requires the final reconciliation of the principles brought into collision during the action of the play. These principles, in the drama before us, are-duty to the family, and duty to the State; the harmonious action of which is necessary to the well-being of society. Thus it would appear that the decree of the senate respecting the burial of the royal brothers, which has been regarded as a dramatic blunder on the part of Æschylus, is in fact essential for bringing about a satisfactory dénouement. When, in spite of the prohibition of the senate, Antigone proclaims her heroic determination to inter her brother: she claims our warmest <pb n="268"/> sympathy and admiration: had she stood alone, her heroism and sisterly affection would have offered a refreshing relief to the deadly hatred of the brothers. The action of the Chorus gives, however, a deeper significance to the episode. The Chorus, it must be remembered, represents in the Greek theatre the moral conscience of the age, in its most elevated form;<ref n="268.1">*</ref> a character strikingly exemplified in the drama before us. At the commencement, indeed, they are timid Theban women, who, vividly realizing the brutal outrages offered to women after the capture of a beleaguered city, are possessed by overwhelming fear. As the drama develops, however, they gradually assume a loftier tone; the words of expostulation addressed by them to Eteocles are full of piety and wisdom: when, therefore, one half of the Chorus follow, with Antigone, the body of Polyneikes, and the other half, with Ismene, that of Eteocles, we may understand that the poet intended thus to recognise the equal sacredness of the principles respectively represented by the sisters, namely, allegiance to the holy tie of kindred-blood, and fealty to the State-the object, in Greek civilization, of the most ardent patriotism.</p>
          <p>The great Theban trilogy, as remarked by Bunsen, begins and ends with deeds of horror; but as the last and heaviest judgment is executed, gracious images of the future surround the bodies of the slain; the devoted heroism displayed by the Theban women " is a living pledge for the moral order of the world,” and offers a <pb n="269"/> spectacle commensurate in grandeur with the darker features of the drama.</p>
          <p>Very interesting is the protest thus offered by the prophet-bard of antiquity against that want of respect for women, and that jealousy of their participation in the functions of men, which find such frequent expression in Greek literature, and which are embodied in the insolent language addressed by Eteocles to the Chorus at the commencement of the drama (v. 169).</p>
          <p>Such examples as that of the Theban women may have inspired the wise utterance of Plato, who declares that for the legislator to leave women without education, and without sufficient scope for their energies, is materially to cripple the power of the State.<ref n="269.1">*</ref></p>
          <p>With regard to the political bearing of the drama, K. 0. Müller remarks that Æschylus strove to moderate the restless struggles of his countrymen after democracy and dominion over other Greeks. The description of the upright Amphiaraus, who wished not to seem, but to be the best; the wise general from whose mind, as from the deep furrows of a well-ploughed field, noble counsels proceed, was universally applied by the Athenian people to Aristeides, and was doubtless intended by Æschylus for him. In conclusion, I may allude to the passage in the Iliad which relates how, when the invading army reached Asôpos' banks, Tydeus was sent forward to Thebes to speak the common message of the host. Admitted into the palace of Eteocles, undaunted though alone, he <pb n="270"/> challenged the Cadmeians to combat, and, through Athena's aid, came off victorious. Whereupon the Cadmeians sought to compass his returning steps, and planted an ambush of fifty warriors; these Tydeus slew, one only being left to bear the tidings homeward.</p>
          <p>This treachery on the part of the Cadmeians furnishes a motive for the impetuous eagerness manifested by Tydeus to advance to the attack: it may also throw light upon the iron-hearted purpose of the infuriated chiefs, which found expression in their terrible oath—</p>

In the text it is generally understood to bear the first of these significations. Sophocles, in the Electra (6), calls Apollo the wolf-slaying god (<quote xml:lang="grc">λυκοκτόνος</quote>).</note>

          <note type="footnote" n="278.1">* Our poet cannot have mistaken the names borne by the gates of Thebes in his own day; but two of them, Oncan and Borrhæan, differ from the names as given by Pausanias some four centuries later. Pausanias has the four names, Proitid, Electran, Neïtan and Homoloid, in common with Æschylus; but besides, he has the Ogygian, the Crenean, and the Hypistai (supreme), or gates of Supreme Jupiter, who had a temple near them. Æschylus informs us that Athena had a temple near the Oncan gates; probably she was hence locally entitled Oncan Athena. Oncan was thought to be a Phœnician epithet introduced into Thebes by Cadmos. We can only guess that they were the gates called Ogygian (ancient) in the time of Pausanias. Onca, as a Hebrew word, cannot be confidently interpreted; but it may belong to the same root as Anak, a celebrated family of giants. Æschylus does not name the seventh gate, which may have been the Hypistan. It is quite possible that Borrhæan (or Borrheian, in some editions) meant simply the north gate, and was a secondary appellation. We have <quote xml:lang="grc">Βοῤῥᾶς</quote> (<quote xml:lang="grc">ἄνεμος</quote>), with double <quote xml:lang="grc">ρ</quote>, in Thucydides.<ref n="278.2">†</ref></note>

<p>286. The abrupt <quote xml:lang="grc">τί γένωμαι</quote>? cannot be right. I make no doubt that the poet's syntax was continuous; whether <quote xml:lang="grc">στείχουσι στεφανωταί</quote>, or, <quote xml:lang="grc">ποτὶ πύργου .... στείχουσι στεφάνωμα</quote>, as in Soph. Antig., or again, <quote xml:lang="grc">στεγάνωμα</quote>, the roof.</p>
<p>338. <quote xml:lang="grc">κορκορυγαὶ δ' ἀν' ἄστυ, ποτὶ πόλιν δ' ὁρκάνα πυργῶτις</quote>, should be responded to by <quote xml:lang="grc">παντοδαπὸς δὲ καρπὸς χαμάδις πεσὼν ἀλγύνει κυρήσas</quote>. First, I make little doubt that <quote xml:lang="grc">ποτὶ πόλιν</quote> should be <quote xml:lang="grc">ποτιπίλναται</quote> (approaches) which answers all the conditions of the case. Next, the Cretic <quote xml:lang="grc">ὁρκάνα</quote> convicts the Molossus <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀλγύνει</quote> as false. <quote xml:lang="grc">Πυργῶτις</quote> is wrong both in metre and in sense. <quote xml:lang="grc">Ὀρκάνα</quote> must be the net-rope, by which victors swept the streets and squares, and caught runaways. It seems to be alluded to in Iliad, v. 487, where it has the epithet <quote xml:lang="grc">πάναγρος</quote>, which in the tragic poets may be <quote xml:lang="grc">παντᾰγρος</quote>, or here, perhaps, <quote xml:lang="grc">παντᾰγρεῦτις</quote>.</p>
<p>356—364. In 356—3G4 Hermann has rightly discerned, that the <quote xml:lang="grc">νύκτερον τέλος</quote> does not mean death, but violation of the person; that <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίς</quote> means apprehension, fear, and that <quote xml:lang="grc">εὐνὰν</quote> has been inserted by some one who did not understand the word <quote xml:lang="grc">τέλος</quote> aright. For <quote xml:lang="grc">τλήμονες εὐνὰν</quote> Hermann has <quote xml:lang="grc">τλῆμον αἷσιν</quote>: but it seems to me that we rather need (writing <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τυχόντος</quote>, " any random man," for <quote xml:lang="grc">εὐτυχου̑ντος</quote>)— <pb n="324"/> Here <quote xml:lang="grc">αἰχμάλωτον</quote> must agree with <quote xml:lang="grc">τέλος</quote>—rather harsh; and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐπίῤῥοθον</quote> expresses, that this is a new misery superadded— an after-clap. I have changed the singulars, <quote xml:lang="grc">δυσμενου̑ς, ὑπερτέρου</quote>, into plurals.</p>
<p>781. <quote xml:lang="grc">κρεισσοτέκνων</quote> is clearly absurd, <quote xml:lang="grc">μισοτέκνων</quote> a highly probable correction.</p>
<p>782. It is incredible that the poet should have written <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀραίας ἀρὰς</quote>, as in the old text; and to alter <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀραίας</quote> into <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀρὰς</quote> makes a very weak tautology. I feel some conviction that the poet wrote <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀγρίας τροφούς</quote>, fierce nurses, which he then expounds to be the <quote xml:lang="grc">Ἀράς</quote>.</p>
<p>826. I think the true text must be— in fact, <quote xml:lang="grc">καὶ</quote> demands <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐτεοκλεῖς</quote> preceding.</p>
<p>998. <quote xml:lang="grc">πῆμα πατρὶ πάρευνον. Πῆμα</quote> is interpreted of Jocasta; but could a pious daughter abruptly call her mother a pest? To me it seems that the death of the two brethren was a woe sleeping in the grave by the side of the father.</p>
<p>1041. <quote xml:lang="grc">οὐ διατετίμηται</quote> is obviously corrupt. I suggest.— <quote xml:lang="grc">ἤδη τὰ τοῦδ' οὐ δῆτ' ἀτίμητ' ἦν θεοῖς</quote>. “ Hitherto his fortunes have not been dishonoured by the gods." The reply is: “No; not before he attacked this country"—which quite agrees.</p>
